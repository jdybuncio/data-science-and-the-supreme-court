2019.18-877,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.84,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-877, Allen versus Cooper. Mr. Shaffer."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,6.84,18.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When states infringe the exclusive federal rights that Congress is charged with securing, Congress can make states pay for doing so."
2019.18-877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,137.96,148.36,"All -- all that is -- would be highly persuasive if we didn't have the patent decision, the Florida Prepaid decision."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,154.64,155.72,"Correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.88,200.92,In -- in --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,200.92,201.68,-- and a basis for abrogation.
2019.18-877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.68,207.92,"-- in Katz, the -- the Court concentrated on the bankruptcy authority as a unique authority."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,233.96,239.56,"Your Honor, we rely upon the methodology of Katz and we rely upon the upfront holding of Katz."
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,260.92,272.24,"And do you -- because I read the erroneous dicta language -- maybe I'm misreading it, so you can tell me how -- as just a reference to the statements in Seminole Tribe about the Bankruptcy Clause."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,272.24,273.92,"It's the same sentences, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,326.6,326.88,But if you're --
2019.18-877,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,326.88,327.48,What about --
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,327.48,333.88,"-- if you're right -- if you are right, we would then have to go back to Florida Prepaid, right, and topple that rule?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,333.88,338.24,"It would be certainly open to folks in patent cases to make that argument, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,338.24,341.84,But how -- how could -- how could we have the two rules going simultaneously?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,341.84,342.76,That would be my prediction.
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,350.24,353.52,"So, basically, you're asking us to overrule Florida Prepaid?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,353.52,359.64,"I'm asking this Court to follow Katz, Justice Alito, where I think Florida Prepaid was overruled in relevant part and certainly --"
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,359.64,361.84,You think Katz overruled Florida Prepaid?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,361.84,366.32,I think it -- it overruled -- it overruled the basis for Florida Prepaid.
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,381.4,381.64,So you --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,381.64,382.68,-- of Florida Prepaid.
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,382.68,408.04,"-- you think the state of the law is that every Article I, Section 8 power would have to be considered independently and Florida Prepaid may hold on for a while as a poorly reasoned exception to that rule but ultimately would have to be overruled to bring it in line with the position you're asking us to adopt today?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,408.04,438.32,"I have only one friendly amendment to Your Honor's assumption, which is I don't think that there is any other Article I clause that reflects a plan of the convention waiver in the sense that we're discussing, in terms of the constitutional text and the necessary implications of it, because, for the reasons that this Court has already recognized, we think it is totally incompatible with the framers' text and the framers' contemplation to say that there's any such thing as an exclusive private property right secured by the United States Congress that states are free to infringe without pay."
2019.18-877,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,445.92,451.2,"Well, do you think Florida Prepaid is subject to our usual stare decisis rules or not?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,451.2,454.2,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, obviously, the Court will decide what is its precedent."
2019.18-877,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,464.24,469.84,"Well, the Court said the Patent Remedy Act cannot be sustained under either the Commerce Clause or the Patent Clause."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,477.08,496.76,"It said that without the question having been presented and without any party arguing the question, which is why I -- I would respectfully question whether it's truly a holding, Justice Kavanaugh. But, if it was a holding, it was, just as Your Honor articulated it, based solely on Seminole Tribe, the very same aspect of Seminole Tribe that we read the Court as revisiting and overruling in Katz."
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,506.52,507.08,Could you tell me --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,507.08,508.88,-- Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment basis.
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,508.88,515.84,"-- can you articulate what ""plan of the convention"" means to you? I know what it means in Katz."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,550.24,552.68,"Take those in turn, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.68,556.12,"Or exclusively, an exclusive right to the federal government."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,556.12,565.8,A plan of the convention waiver refers to some reflection that states were surrendering their back-dropped default sovereign immunity in a discrete respect as part of the constitutional convention --
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,565.8,566.28,You don't think --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,566.28,566.92,-- and what came out of it.
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.92,570.44,-- that exclusive jurisdiction would have signaled that more clearly --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,570.44,570.76,I --
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,570.76,573.44,-- than concurrent jurisdiction for over 200 years?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,573.44,577.6,I think that our textual basis for the abrogation is stronger than it was in Katz.
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,610.72,611.24,"Well, you're assuming --"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,611.24,612.28,-- within this discrete realm.
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,612.28,615.56,-- the latter part you're assuming.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,622.56,623.64,To promote progress.
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,623.64,624.36,Number one --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,624.36,626.24,"To promote progress, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,628.92,632.24,Some would say that injunctive relief promotes progress.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,632.24,633.28,"Well, James Madison --"
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,633.28,634.24,That's a damages question.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,637.24,683.24,"James Madison's conception reflected in the text of what the monopoly would achieve is that the authors and inventors would get paid for their inventions. They would get paid for their creations. And as the Court, as I indicated, back in 1888 recognized, it is antithetical to that to say that government of any kind, certainly the federal government, can infringe those exclusive rights that -- that Congress is to be securing. But, as to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor, this is a case and a legislative record different from what the Court had before it in Florida Prepaid. It is much stronger in relevant part. In part, that's because of the fundamental difference between copyright law at issue in this case and patent law that the Court was looking at in Florida Prepaid. In part, it's also because you have a legislative record that is so much stronger, Your Honors."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,700.76,717.68,"But you tell us in your brief that when Congress enacted the CRCA it had ""16 examples over the previous decade of reported state infringement in 13 states."" Is -- is that enough to identify a serious constitutional problem?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,717.68,718.76,"I think so, Justice Alito."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,738.96,740.76,Sixteen examples is not enough.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,750.44,753.2,"We think it follows in the copyright context, Justice Alito."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,753.2,760.56,Every -- every infringement is a violate -- every infringement by a state or by the federal government is a constitutional violation?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,760.56,766.84,The nature of the exclusive intellectual property right is that one will have the right respected or else be compensated for an intrusion.
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,781.92,783.28,But what if it's negligent?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,783.28,798.72,"I don't think it -- Justice Alito, I don't think it can be negligent in a relevant sense. The -- the -- the -- the government may permit procedural due process violations by doing all sorts of things negligently, denying notice, denying opportunity to be heard, a spurious welfare cancellation."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,875.44,879.56,But do you think that record is stronger than the record in City of Boerne?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,879.56,889.96,"Your Honor, I think the intrusion here is much lighter than in City of Boerne. Here, all that states are being held to substantively is the same rule they've been under since the founding: Don't infringe copyrights."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,891.6,901.2,"Well, that may be true, but the question is, is there greater congruence and proportionality here than there was in City of Boerne, or maybe that we should reexamine City of Boerne too? That's a --"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,901.2,902.68,I'm not urging that.
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,902.68,904.12,It's a -- okay.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,904.12,916.72,"I'm -- I'm not urging that, and I don't think the Court needs to reexamine that because there isn't the same sort of congruence and proportionality problem. Part of what was at issue I think in City of Boerne, and rightfully concerned the Court, is Congress was redefining the substantive law."
2019.18-877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,975.04,978.72,You -- you said it was inevitably intentional copying.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1001.68,1003.68,"Your Honor, that's what they say."
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1071.56,1072.88,Mr. Shaffer -- please.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1072.88,1073.6,"I'm sorry, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1086.44,1086.52,How --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1086.52,1088.52,-- and the CRCA is valid as to that.
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1089.32,1101.68,"How -- how do we figure out how much is enough in a legislative record? You said these 16 instances are enough. In Florida Prepaid, I believe there were eight instances, and we said that wasn't enough. Now what's the difference between the two --"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1101.68,1102.44,I think that --
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1102.44,1103.6,"-- other than eight, you know?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1103.6,1106.44,-- part of it is the fundamental difference between patents and copyrights.
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1131.92,1134.96,"Yeah, because you could look at 16 as a really low number."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1146.16,1175.08,"It was reported -- there were 16 reports oftentimes of multiple instances of infringement or bad-faith conduct by states. That's encompassed within the 16 that we're referring to. And as to that, there were dozens of comments that were received about is this a bigger problem, is this an increasing problem? And Congress, per the Register, found that, yes, it was. And it might be different, Justice Kagan, if there were 16 examples after three decades had passed, but the reality is Congress saw the tip of the iceberg of this problem."
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1194.04,1194.36,But how --
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1194.36,1195.28,Congress was exactly right.
2019.18-877,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1195.28,1198.96,-- do we think about that? Because a lot of that is not in the record.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1206.72,1236.36,"You have a clear rationale from Congress in the record, which is that there was a newly emerging problem and a tip of the iceberg, and Congress wanted to ward it off, Justice Kagan. And perhaps in a case like City of Boerne, the Court might be skeptical as to whether this was a good-faith, sound prediction by Congress or whether it was paranoia or whether it was pretextual. I think the Court should be heartened here, Justice Kagan, by the fact that exactly what Congress feared would come to pass has come to pass over and over and over again."
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1242.88,1258.6,"Why hasn't there -- after Florida Prepaid, why -- why -- why do you think -- why has there not been, have not been, many, many instances in which states decide, well, look at all this text stuff, it's fabulous, we'll just copy all the patents? Why not?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1258.6,1261.72,"Justice Breyer, there has been a lot -- I mean, there has been a lot of that."
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.76,1274.88,All over California. Why doesn't California have a budget problem? We'll just take all the Silicon Valley material and -- and we'll copy it.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1274.88,1277.0,If you read from Dow Jones -- I -- I committed to --
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.0,1277.2,They're doing it?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1277.2,1280.92,"Your Honor, that's what they did tens of thousands of times over with --"
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.92,1282.28,I'm not talking about copyright.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1283.56,1287.76,"As to patents, I don't think that -- that states are in the patent business to the same extent, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1288.24,1291.32,Why don't they -- why don't they -- here's the solution to all their budget problems?
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1291.32,1297.0,"Well, maybe they're afraid that this Court might be there at the end of the day to answer unresolved questions after Florida Prepaid."
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.0,1299.96,What? What question? We apparently said they could go do it.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1299.96,1303.72,"Well, we think that there's still an Article I -- a question as to the Article I basis."
2019.18-877,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.52,1308.12,"I, of course, dissented. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1308.12,1310.16,"We -- I -- I know it well, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1310.16,1314.96,"Well, you -- what you say raises an interesting question under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1355.8,1358.72,Because you've never looked at this legislative record before.
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1394.68,1406.24,"So -- so can Congress say we're enacting this under Section 5 and we recognize that there's not much of a record of state violations at this point, but we predict that there is going to be?"
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1406.24,1413.24,"If -- if the remedy is sufficiently well tailored around the constitutional deprivation, my answer to that is yes, Justice Alito."
2019.18-877,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1430.6,1433.48,But I didn't understand you to be making an argument under U.S. versus Georgia.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1437.52,1440.96,"I think it's on North Carolina to make an as-applied challenge, Justice Alito."
2019.18-877,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1470.2,1476.52,But you didn't make below the -- any -- at least I didn't see an argument based on U.S. v. Georgia.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1476.52,1478.6,"We didn't, I think, cite U.S. v. Georgia."
2019.18-877,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1502.04,1541.92,"You've done a very nice job of showing in your papers -- the Blackbeard law does trouble me deeply, but you're doing nothing with proving the proportionality to the problem because there are states that presumably have fine remedies to handle any infringement. You've shown some failings in this state's processes, but I don't know how any of the evidence developed by Congress shows that all 50 states and territories additionally don't have adequate state systems to address this issue."
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1541.92,1544.08,"If I may answer the question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-877,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1544.08,1544.48,Briefly.
2019.18-877,0,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,1544.48,1545.64,"Very briefly, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-877,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.8,1581.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Park."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1581.72,1588.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: State sovereign immunity is a fundamental feature of our Constitution's structure."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.48,1722.68,"What is there that I can go to the same question, a wonderful money-raising thing."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.56,1793.32,"Now, great idea. Several billion dollars flows into the treasury. Okay? Now, if you win, why won't that happen? And, by the way, if you're writing to the constitutional convention, you're a member, okay, and you write these words, copyright is to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for a limited time to authors -- and to authors, the exclusive right to their respective writings. But, of course, California decides that the person who wrote Rocky, Marvel, et cetera, will unfortunately receive nothing because everyone will have seen it on the state's own streaming device. All right."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1795.0,1799.0,"So there are two important separate issues at issue there, and I'll start with the text."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.72,1831.6,"Oh, it's -- by the way, we ran it yesterday."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1836.04,1836.72,"Yes, exactly."
2019.18-877,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1866.92,1867.32,There are not going to be --
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1867.32,1867.96,-- government resources.
2019.18-877,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1867.96,1869.28,-- there are not going to be hard cases.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1870.96,1871.44,Well --
2019.18-877,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1871.44,1890.48,"And it's not -- and Justice Breyer's point is that it could be rampant, states ripping off copyright holders. And how is that -- how can that be squared with the exclusive right, if states can do this, which presumably a ruling in your favor will do nothing but encourage them to do?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1890.48,1895.6,"So I think that's the beauty of the Copyright Remedy Act, combined with this Court's Georgia decision."
2019.18-877,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1900.44,1904.0,Why is it extreme? You've said hard cases and now extreme.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1908.56,1919.4,"Well, so whenever a plaintiff can reasonably allege that there has been intentional copyright infringement and there are not adequate remedies, then, under this Court's Georgia decision, they can bring a direct constitutional claim."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.16,1969.0,"Your view is that -- that, in fact, under the Fourteenth Amendment, this statute is valid insofar as my Captain Marvel example deliberately takes property from people."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1970.48,1971.2,"Yes, if the --"
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1971.2,1971.44,All right.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,1997.12,2016.16,"I think it follows naturally from this Court's Georgia decision, but I would add one additional element, which is, to complete a due process violation for a deprivation of property, two additional features are required; you need to be deliberate and there needs to be no alternative remedy. And, here, there are other alternative remedies that could be available."
2019.18-877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.16,2018.92,Let -- let's take deliberate first.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2040.4,2056.0,I think it would be intentional if the State had not explicitly bargained for a provision that says we can use Mr. Allen's images for non-commercial purposes. And now I think that that highlights how this dispute is really a dispute over the scope of a contractual license that the State received.
2019.18-877,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2072.16,2074.24,"Do -- I'm sorry, finish."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2074.24,2085.16,"I just was going to point out as well that I think that relieves any actual due process violation that could be here because, of course, there's -- the alternative remedy is a breach of contract lawsuit, which we have not asserted sovereign immunity for."
2019.18-877,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2089.12,2098.44,"What do I do with the Blackbeard law? It is deeply troubling. It's a state saying, even if I'm infringing, you can't get anything."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2107.92,2109.2,So I agree it's a strange law.
2019.18-877,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2120.44,2123.32,"Well, it could to a Georgia argument, obviously."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2123.32,2130.88,"Well, so I think -- and I think that exposes the second issue, which is that there are -- there are two types of claims in this complaint."
2019.18-877,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2178.16,2191.08,So why wasn't it a taking? Why wasn't the passage of that law a taking when -- when the law declares that something that is private property is now a public record?
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2191.08,2212.24,"So I think it possibly could be on different facts, if Mr. Allen hadn't already agreed in the contract that his images were public records, but I think that this would be a pretty extraordinary vehicle for this Court to decide when copyright infringement can constitute a taking. I'm not aware of any federal court that has ever reached that question because it hasn't been litigated."
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2246.36,2258.6,"Well, what about Section 5, Mr. Park? Congress clearly wanted to abrogate the state sovereign immunity, so what would it have had to have done in your view in order to do that successfully?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2258.6,2264.64,I think that it should have followed the rules laid out by this Court in City of Boerne and subsequent cases.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2275.72,2279.32,"What would a record that does meet those standards, what would it look like?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2279.32,2284.4,So it would be trained on identifying copyright infringement that also violated the Constitution.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2287.92,2301.52,"Well, can't Congress say something like in copyright, you know, any violation requires actual copying? So we're going to assume that 80 percent of the violations in the world are intentional?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2301.52,2313.16,"So I think that that would activate the danger that this Court designed the City of Boerne test to prevent, which is changing the substance of law under Section 5. Now, under copyright law, that willful infringement is a recognized --"
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2313.16,2313.48,Whoa --
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2313.48,2313.56,-- standard.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2313.56,2341.8,"-- whoa, whoa, whoa. Because there's clearly some allowance for Congress to devise prophylactic rules, and this would seem to be a perfect example of like, you know what, given the requirements of a copyright violation, we think the vast majority of them are going to be intentional and, therefore, are going to be constitutional violations. Are you saying Congress can't say that and just target copyright violations generally?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2341.8,2342.88,I think that they could.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2355.92,2357.72,"Well, how do they show that?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2357.72,2362.36,"Well, I think, at the very least, they focused on intentional infringement. I would direct the Court to Mr. --"
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2362.36,2363.8,I think I just talked about that.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2363.8,2363.96,Right.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2363.96,2373.04,They've decided that 80 percent of copyright violations are intentional because copyright violations always involve actual copying.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2376.04,2376.2,Yeah --
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2376.2,2378.08,"Not impossible, but hard."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2388.64,2428.08,"So I think there would be the additional analysis, which is the proportionality prong of the test, which requires that there be some tailoring of the remedies that are given by Congress to what is required by the Due Process Clause. And no one has ever claimed -- I'm not aware of any copyright holder that has ever claimed that the exorbitant remedies found in the Copyright Act are required by due process. I mean, we're talking about $150,000 per infringement even for an infringement where the plaintiff says I cannot prove any actual damages, but because this infringement was so egregious on its merits, I deserve statutory damages."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.08,2451.56,"Here, as I -- I see the problem, which you've clarified very much for me, it's that the choice for us now is, say, your view would be that -- that states can copy without doing anything unless that copying violates the Due Process Clause."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.64,2510.76,"-- but the other view would be it's likely that there are enough cases where it would violate the Due Process Clause for us to accept the statute as a whole, thereby creating in a sense another somewhat different exception to the statement in Florida Prepaid. I'm trying to get our issue, and I'm trying to say it fairly from your point of view and from the other point of view."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2510.76,2513.96,So -- so let me clarify in terms of your first construct.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2573.08,2595.0,"Do you think Congress is able to make judgments about what proportion of copyright violations are indeed intentional? If -- if Congress had said, given the requirement of actual copying, we think a vast majority of copyright infringements are intentional, would that be precluded? Would that -- would that fall within Congress's power or not?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2595.0,2608.56,"Yes, I think that Congress warrants a great deal of deference in this area. And so, if they had conducted that examination and they had made that conclusion in a finding or it was clear in the legislative record that that was what Congress was focusing on --"
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2608.56,2621.56,"So do you think that's what Congress has to do here? Congress has to say, we think most copyright violations are indeed intentional and therefore violate due process? And here there are 30 examples, would that be enough?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2621.56,2628.32,I don't -- I don't believe that there is a strict numerical threshold that is required to legislate under Section 5.
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2640.16,2644.56,"Well, why isn't the proportional remedy the same remedy that everybody else has to pay?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2644.56,2645.96,Because --
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2645.96,2665.36,"I mean, once Congress has decided that we think that there are loads of constitutional violations going on, why doesn't the state have to pay what every other actor would have to pay when it engages in those constitutional violations? Why isn't that almost sort of, by definition, proportional? That's what people pay."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2665.36,2683.2,"It would be proportional to the -- the Copyright Act, but Section 5 has to be focused on enforcing the Due Process Clause, and the Due Process Clause only requires at most compensatory relief. And so I think that that exposes how my friend on the other side is trying to constitutionalize copyright law."
2019.18-877,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.4,2704.2,"But it's both you and your friend, because what you will have the courts doing is, case by case, when -- when, say, California tries to run -- they won't run Captain Marvel, maybe it's some old movie, you know, and they say it's fair use."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2739.44,2754.64,"Well, so I don't think that's going -- going to be difficult for the lower courts to -- to wade through that state of the law because they're merely applying the ordinary rules of copyright. So willful infringement, we think, would constitute intentional infringement."
2019.18-877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2782.32,2782.76,But they won't --
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2782.76,2783.12,-- employees.
2019.18-877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2783.12,2793.96,"-- have the same deep pocket that the state has. Let me ask one aspect of this question, Mr. Park."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2852.64,2856.8,So I don't think that they could do that because I think that would be an unconstitutional condition.
2019.18-877,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.76,2901.44,"Counsel, just to get back to your statement that all you have to do is sue the state officers, you -- you'd certainly reimburse the officer, wouldn't you?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2901.44,2902.92,"Yes, that's -- that's correct."
2019.18-877,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2902.92,2908.8,"So is that all they have to do, just name the officer, rather than the state, in their infringement action?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2908.8,2927.0,"Well, I think that -- so, yes, that most states would reimburse their state officers if -- if it was within the scope of their employment, and that there would be additional hurdles in that kind of case. Qualified immunity would apply. And qualified immunity applied in this case, and that's why the -- the claims were dismissed against the individual officers."
2019.18-877,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2927.0,2932.0,"Well, then it's not much of a -- it's not much of a response to say, well, you can sue the officer."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2932.0,2932.8,Again --
2019.18-877,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2932.8,2935.32,"It gets thrown out right away, but you can still sue him."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,2937.24,2958.76,"Well, I think it is in this context and -- and here's why, because intentionality under the Due Process Clause is roughly equivalent to the qualified immunity analysis. That's what this Court said in Kingsley versus Hendrickson, that it's -- intentionality is judged by an objective standard under all the facts and circumstances available to the officer, is what they did, can that be construed as intentional."
2019.18-877,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2982.24,3016.96,"Mr. Park, can I take you back to the -- the interesting suggestion that perhaps Congress could have justified what it did in this act by saying that we predict that a high percentage of copyright infringements are intentional and, therefore, violate due process. If we were to accept that, is there any reason why the same reasoning would not apply in patent litigation?"
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,3016.96,3019.64,"No, I don't believe there is any -- any distinction there."
2019.18-877,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3175.6,3186.2,You said the blanket statement in Seminole Tribe was incorrect and Florida Prepaid relied on that same blanket statement in Seminole Tribe.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,3191.88,3193.24,"Yes, I -- I completely agree."
2019.18-877,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3200.08,3201.92,It's two sentences.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,3201.92,3203.92,"That's correct, Your Honor. It's very limited."
2019.18-877,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3245.2,3248.72,I just -- I really don't follow your reliance argument.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,3262.6,3266.8,"I -- I think that I am speaking about the state's reliance interests, for the states generally."
2019.18-877,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3299.48,3311.16,"I think, though, Mr. Park, what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, that it's not the strongest reliance argument to say we relied on this -- this Court's holding to infringe other people's rights."
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,3311.16,3312.92,Not -- not to infringe on other people's rights.
2019.18-877,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.68,3387.08,You can finish the sentence.
2019.18-877,1,63178,ryan_park,,3387.08,3392.4,-- that they will -- that they will infringe at will if damages liability is taken off the table. Thank you.
2019.18-877,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3392.4,3396.4,"Thank you, Mr. Park. Four minutes, Mr. Shaffer."
2019.18-877,2,63177,derek_l_shaffer,,3396.4,3423.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Starting with Blackbeard's law, Justice Sotomayor, I want to be clear, Blackbeard's law was passed after the allegations of infringement in -- in this case, after North Carolina had been caught infringing. It was then used, as -- as alleged in the complaint, by North Carolina to defend against the state court suit by Intersal because they said Blackbeard's law had voided the settlement agreement. It was now contrary to North Carolina's public policy and they couldn't be held to the settlement agreement, nor could they be held liable."
2019.18-877,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3651.44,3652.32,"Thank you, counsel."
