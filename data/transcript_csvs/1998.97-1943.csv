1998.97-1943,0,43605,van_aaron_hughes,,11.306,14.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,69.41,74.464,"Is that raised in your petition for certiorari, whether they were regarded as disabled?"
1998.97-1943,0,43605,van_aaron_hughes,,74.464,76.064,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1998.97-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.064,76.75,Whereabouts?
1998.97-1943,0,43605,van_aaron_hughes,,76.75,91.074,"The... I believe it was the third question presented in our petition, read as followed: Is a commercial pilot regarded as disabled by a major airline that refuses to employ her as a pilot for that airline due to her poor vision?"
1998.97-1943,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.074,102.116,"As far as actual disability is concerned, let me ask the same question that... that we put to counsel yesterday."
1998.97-1943,0,43605,van_aaron_hughes,,120.927,121.929,Justice--
1998.97-1943,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.929,127.849,"There would be many, many, many more than that if... if you are counting people who have to wear eyeglasses."
1998.97-1943,0,43605,van_aaron_hughes,,127.849,131.635,"--I agree, Justice Scalia, that there are more than 43 million Americans who wear glasses."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1115.134,1126.442,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.889,1158.21,"Say again what you conceive the anomaly to be, Mr. Kneedler."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1158.21,1159.727,--The... the anomaly in this case is--
1998.97-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.727,1160.995,Speak kind of a little bit slower.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1160.995,1161.545,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-1943,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.206,1188.693,Do you think... do you think that the statute should be interpreted so that it depends on how the particular employer looks at the applicant?
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1197.918,1198.501,--No.
1998.97-1943,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.951,1200.384,All right.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1208.107,1209.04,No.
1998.97-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.34,1236.923,How about the 43 million figure?
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1236.923,1243.91,"--The 43 million figure, Your Honor... there's no indication what Congress was referring to when it looked at that."
1998.97-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.218,1257.754,"Well, but 43 million is in there as a fact."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1257.754,1258.504,"--Right, right."
1998.97-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.491,1296.427,"But where do you get that out of the statute, that--"
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1296.427,1298.062,From... from the phrase substantially limited.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1299.845,1304.533,"--Yes, but it doesn't answer whether you view it corrected or uncorrected."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1305.616,1306.485,"--No, no."
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1307.151,1309.27,--it just is not apparent from the face of the statute--
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1309.27,1310.737,--I... I was responding--
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1310.737,1312.222,--that we wouldn't look at the corrected--
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1312.222,1312.722,--No.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1313.172,1313.705,--vision.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1313.705,1320.292,"--responding to the Chief Justice's point that 43 million speaks to that question, and I think it does... does not."
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.862,1331.683,If you use... what's worrying is if you say it should be uncorrected.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1331.683,1332.166,Yes.
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.166,1335.718,And then you read out of the statute people who have glasses like this.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1350.077,1350.911,And our... yes.
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.427,1351.794,All right.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1352.244,1352.711,--position--
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.711,1361.65,--Now take a person just like me except that person has the same vision I have without glasses with glasses.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1364.519,1365.852,"--Well, it... it depends."
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.669,1367.554,He can't wear glasses.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1367.554,1368.471,--That person may have--
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1368.471,1370.337,He has a defect because he can't wear glasses.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1372.389,1372.906,--That person--
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1372.906,1374.422,And wouldn't those people be handicapped?
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1374.422,1375.422,--That person may have... have a--
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.422,1375.858,Disabled.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1375.858,1384.797,"--In... in that particular case, but that... but in the ordinary case, a person whose vision is not fully corrected to 20/20 may have a very, very severe uncorrected impairment."
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.666,1394.485,"But I don't know all the disabilities in the world, and it might be that people are disabled in ways where most people can correct, but they can't."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1394.485,1395.119,Well--
1998.97-1943,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1395.119,1398.937,And now I'm concerned about what your definition will do to those people.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1398.937,1413.281,"--Well, as to those people, certainly if an employer acts on the basis or... or anyone else covered by the act acts on the basis... treats that person as disabled, then the regarded as prong would... would protect that person just as... as it alternatively protects that person here."
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1413.281,1423.422,Why doesn't the regarded as prong serve as the backdrop and so you... you have no problem looking at the corrected condition of the person?
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1423.422,1428.374,"Well, the regarded as prong, properly construed, does afford a great deal of protection."
1998.97-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.624,1459.993,What's the difference between treated as and regarded as?
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1459.993,1463.611,"--Well, let me explain perhaps by illustrating in this very case."
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.564,1496.414,"Well, that's not true for that entire class."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1517.493,1518.027,Well--
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.027,1523.647,And this other... this other person is very good and could well be fine in another team.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1533.52,1539.407,"--Well, first of all, in that example, I think the manager is going to choose the person who hits the best and not who has the best eyesight."
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.941,1541.026,No.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1548.363,1549.013,"No, but... but--"
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1549.013,1550.299,You know the way managers play the odds.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1550.299,1551.099,"--No, but... but--"
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.099,1552.682,They'll put in a left-hand batter and all of that.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1552.682,1571.243,"--I'm... I'm... our position isn't... isn't that it's automatically so, but... but our position is that when you have an employer who has jobs that we have to take as a given, according to the allegations in the complaint, are the same as piloting jobs elsewhere, the employer is essentially necessarily making a judgment about the class when he's making a judgment about the particular employees--"
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.243,1571.409,He's not.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1582.215,1592.157,"--This came... this case comes up on a motion to dismiss, and... and certainly it is... it is relevant if the employer is making a judgment about what is safe to drive an... or pilot an airplane, which is what this employer is doing--"
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1592.157,1595.442,"Just certain airplanes, global--"
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1595.442,1595.975,--No.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.209,1597.977,--piloting positions.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1597.977,1602.112,--The allegation in the complaint is United regarded them as unable to drive any... pilot any airplane.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.112,1602.862,Any... any airplane.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1602.862,1603.378,Any airplane.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.378,1606.211,"Even though they were, in fact, at the time pilots of a regional--"
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1606.211,1610.579,The regarded as looks at how the... what particular employer treats the employee.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1611.446,1612.948,--And that was the allegation.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1612.948,1613.365,--Yes.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.365,1616.4,"So, you say a motion to dismiss should not have been granted."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1616.4,1616.8,Yes.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1621.387,1628.04,"And the regulation says the inability to perform a single, particular job, to wit, a pilot for United--"
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1628.04,1628.524,Right.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1629.074,1629.374,--is not--
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1629.374,1630.076,--No.
1998.97-1943,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.076,1631.476,--a substantial limitation on work.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1631.476,1633.528,A single job doesn't mean pilot with United.
1998.97-1943,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1658.977,1669.217,"So, for purposes of... of the reg, you assume that every other airline will do exactly what this airline is doing for determining whether you meet the class criterion."
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1669.617,1669.884,"In general, yes."
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.317,1672.0,--What happens to myths and stereotypes?
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1677.321,1679.654,"--Well, that is... that is the driving force behind it, but that--"
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.654,1680.939,It isn't the driving force at all.
1998.97-1943,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1687.01,1696.365,"--It is following a... a stereotype in... in the sense that United is saying we don't regard you, treat you as qualified to fly our airplanes safely."
1998.97-1943,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.084,1704.138,That's not a stereotype to say that I don't like this particular type of thing.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1717.596,1722.766,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.346,1749.35,Do we owe deference to the EEOC on this point of how you view it?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1749.35,1751.766,On the corrected versus uncorrected--
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.766,1752.066,Yes.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1752.066,1752.468,--absolutely not.
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1752.468,1753.485,And why not?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1753.485,1754.802,For a number of reasons.
1998.97-1943,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.071,1791.491,"What was the status of that prior case, the Kienast case, in 1990?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1799.664,1800.214,No.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.735,1812.055,Would it make sense... earlier this term we decided a case involving a handicapped child.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1814.174,1814.691,Garret F.--
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.691,1815.774,Cedar Rapids.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1815.774,1816.674,--Yes.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.674,1825.129,And I think in there we had some language in respect to the agency might want to deal with this and fully consider it and so forth.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1832.552,1837.087,"I think not on corrected versus uncorrected, Justice Breyer, because I think the statute is clear."
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.543,1848.912,"Yes, but it doesn't say whether corrected or uncorrected or whether corrected always or some circumstances."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1848.912,1851.864,--It says none of those things because that's not the concepts of the statute.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.234,1857.918,All right.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1870.26,1870.91,"Of course, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.91,1874.445,--be the very victims of the prejudice and myth that the statute is aimed at.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1874.445,1875.162,Of course.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.162,1877.314,And... and they wouldn't even get in the door.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1877.314,1880.266,"No, that's... that's not correct, respectfully, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.864,1922.593,"It would produce enormous litigation on that point, and this is an unusual statute I take it; whereas, our other discrimination statutes are open to everyone to come in and say I'm discriminated... I am a member of the protected class discriminated against, and you know, I'm black, I'm a woman."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1924.711,1926.011,"--Well, the key words--"
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1926.011,1927.247,Here you don't get in the door.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1927.247,1928.58,--The key words... excuse me.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1928.58,1929.597,You go ahead.

1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.299,1931.699,Yes.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1931.699,1938.186,"This statute is not like title VII which protects black people, white people, men and women, and people who are neither black nor white."
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.951,1992.938,"This... this is what I'm... this is the question I'm trying to get to, which is think of the 44 million."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,1996.807,1997.257,Yes.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.257,2011.4,"The following occurred to me, that if you open the door to the myopic people by looking only at uncorrected state, 100 million people will not walk through that door."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2040.252,2040.835,"No, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.218,2042.118,"--or a few thousand, or at most a million."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2043.704,2044.087,--I--
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.087,2047.256,--with the legislative history to look at uncorrected state.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2049.039,2053.393,--I must respectfully disagree with you with respect to both the text of the statute and the legislative history.
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.358,2131.143,"Mr. Englert, can I get back to deference to EEOC?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2163.964,2167.066,"Well, but... but first of all, it has to be an ambiguous statute."
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.066,2167.685,That's true.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2167.685,2168.218,Second--
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.218,2169.035,That's a different argument.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2169.035,2171.47,"--Second, you referred to Chevron deference."
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.939,2176.456,Why?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2177.289,2178.389,Because it's interpretive guidance.
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.389,2179.639,--Why not Chevron deference?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2179.639,2186.893,"Because it's interpretive guidance and not regulation, and in General Electric Company v. Gilbert, this Court said, EEOC interpretive guidance gets--"
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.893,2188.161,What was the date of General Electric?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2188.161,2189.161,--It predated Chevron.
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.861,2190.161,Yes.

1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.724,2212.026,Why?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2212.026,2213.309,Because--
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.309,2221.798,We give deference to agencies who have... who... whose position is not enunciated except in litigation so long as it wasn't made up for this particular case.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2221.798,2222.332,--You can give some--
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.332,2227.786,"If an agency has... has consistently taken a certain position in... in legislation, we've given deference to it."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2227.786,2228.152,--Consistently.
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.69,2233.123,What a wonderful world this is.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2233.123,2233.723,Formality.
1998.97-1943,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.723,2235.392,There are all sorts of gradations?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2244.664,2245.231,No.
1998.97-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.783,2255.686,"Bragdon certainly suggests... last term talks both about Skidmore deference and about Chevron deference, does it not?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2255.686,2256.138,--Yes.
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.208,2275.366,"Mr. Englert, even if we were to agree with you, that you look at vision in its corrected state under the statute, there is a regarded as feature of the statute."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2287.408,2293.411,Those words were used but there is no allegation sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss on regarded as.

1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2300.5,2302.617,--Pages 24 and 25 of the joint appendix.
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.074,2387.439,"Well, but in d, they allege that United... its position is based on stereotype, myth, or unsubstantiated fears, that they have no data or evidence indicating that the plaintiffs' visual acuity and use of corrective lenses presents safety concerns."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2387.439,2387.873,Well--

1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2396.145,2399.264,"Well, we don't require that much on a motion to dismiss--"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2399.264,2400.131,"--No, but--"
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.131,2401.116,--on the face of a complaint.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2401.116,2403.283,--The court does not require that much.
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.485,2436.622,"That's exactly what's bothering me, that if... you might be right."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2488.805,2489.941,Well--
1998.97-1943,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.941,2493.459,And it's that kind of interpretation possibly that's worrying the EEOC.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2493.459,2502.081,"--Justice Breyer, to some extent this gets back to our earlier colloquy about defining a protected class and... and then invoking the protections of the statute."
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2510.754,2513.52,"Well, how... how do you read this regarded as prong?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2532.184,2533.384,"Well, they were... they were--"
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2533.384,2536.452,Why is this not sufficient under the regarded as?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2536.452,2538.904,--Because they were even more specific.
1998.97-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.843,2577.229,"Mr. Englert, what in your opinion would qualify?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2583.033,2584.566,There are many examples.
1998.97-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.46,2609.184,"Well, what about someone, say, who has an artificial leg and... but, nonetheless, is perfectly able to drive and can drive as well as... meet any driving test?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2618.456,2620.189,He may be.
1998.97-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.597,2632.947,"Well, but this... this thing works great for him."

1998.97-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.366,2665.834,Supposing I have an artificial finger and he's afraid I can't honk the horn.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2666.634,2668.8,--Well--
1998.97-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.8,2673.054,So that there wouldn't... wouldn't be any obvious major disability.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2673.054,2675.254,--That does sound like a case for regarded as.
1998.97-1943,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2679.889,2695.066,"Yes, and particularly in... in this case, one of the stumbling blocks is that United did treat the applicant in its uncorrected condition for the regarded as prong."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2698.183,2704.571,"Well, the question is whether it regarded them as having an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity."
1998.97-1943,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2704.571,2708.725,"That's... that's the next question, but you... you admit that it, of course, regarded them in their uncorrected state."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2708.725,2709.375,No.
1998.97-1943,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2713.243,2714.66,"Well, this whole act is metaphysical."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2716.279,2728.087,"--But... but until 1996, Justice Kennedy, no Government authority had... that I'm aware of had ever said don't look at people in both their corrected and their uncorrected state."
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2737.775,2738.608,"Okay, but let's take this case."
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2767.461,2774.948,"For just the reason that some of your own earlier questions suggested, Justice O'Connor, which is that eliminating someone from a single job is not regarded as."
1998.97-1943,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2783.887,2789.124,"Well, we didn't take that question here in this case, did we?"
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2792.576,2797.48,"I believe the grant of cert in this case was unrestricted, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.48,2807.77,May... may I ask in that connection if the... if the evidence or the allegation was that United is just like 10 different... all 10 major airlines have the same rule.
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2812.323,2816.941,"No, not if it's limited to major airlines and... and not if it's limited to pilot positions."

1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2833.903,2835.772,"--Not if it's limited to just the blue ribbons, no."
1998.97-1943,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.439,2839.141,Didn't you quote a reg more or less supporting your position?
1998.97-1943,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,2843.993,2845.045,--No.
1998.97-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.747,2853.132,It's sort of a market share antitrust test?

1998.97-1943,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3545.655,3548.457,Why does that... where... how do you get that?
1998.97-1943,3,43605,van_aaron_hughes,,3562.799,3570.889,"--Your Honor, we've alleged that it is and we believe that's so because the objective evidence is that there has never been a problem associated with pilots with correctable vision."
1998.97-1943,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3575.474,3576.757,"Thank you, Mr. Hughes."
