1980.79-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,We'll hear arguments next in Parratt and Lugenbill v. Taylor.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,72.279,76.431,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1734,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,157.618,160.087,You say as a part of their clerical duties.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,167.658,168.426,--They do.
1980.79-1734,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.71,171.378,Do you agree?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,171.378,173.778,--Do I agree that it was against prison regulations?
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.044,370.354,"How would your argument change if the inmate said, you've lost my property, and the answer is, yes, we have."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,381.995,395.569,"If that were the case, then I think what you've got is a problem of denying the inmate, if in fact that was within the power of the people, denying him the access to his remedy."
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.569,398.604,"Yes, it's no longer just a piece of negligence, is it?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,398.604,398.954,No.
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,409.479,421.504,"Well, suppose Texas law just hasn't got any, there isn't any... or Nebraska law, there just isn't any remedy, internal remedy under the state law."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,444.169,458.412,"Well, but I think the thing that you would... I guess I would urge that type of situation be evaluated in the context not so much of imposing personal liability on these persons."
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.345,515.265,At least you wouldn't be making the same argument here if that had happened.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,523.521,529.258,On those facts I would move directly to my second argument regarding the basis of the negligence.
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.158,530.575,But why?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,550.189,554.323,--I guess I've lost the trail here somehow.
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.323,557.175,I'm just suggesting it is no longer just a negligence question.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,557.175,559.777,"No, I think that's correct."
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.71,564.681,Then it wouldn't do you any good to move on to your second argument.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,564.681,584.86,"--Well, if you've got the problem of what is protected... and I think you have to look at this in the context, it seems to me, of personal liability, and just what exactly the authority of these defendants is with respect to repayment of these types of losses."
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.573,609.46,"Mr. Brown, I'm not clear on your position with respect to whether or not there is a process in Nebraska."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,609.46,609.993,Our position is--
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.993,619.499,"First you imply that they failed to make a claim under the Nebraska Claims Act and then you said the burden is on them to demonstrate the absence of the Claims Act, I guess."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,623.051,653.506,"--Our position is that a state remedy exists and that if the plaintiff is to make out a case that he has been denied property without due process of law, he not only needs to show that he has lost his property but that by some mechanism he has been denied due process of law, that that loss has occurred to him without some type of adequate process, whatever process might be found to be due him under those circumstances."
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.506,659.643,"Well, is it... as a matter of fact, I guess, you should be the expert on what Nebraska law is, here."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,666.297,680.556,"The Nebraska State Tort Claims Act regularly considers and regularly pays, where deemed appropriate, claims for property lost, property damage, this type of thing, of the inmates of our state institutions."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.556,681.556,I see.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,687.043,692.631,The inmate initially files a claim with the State Tort Claims Board.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.764,694.899,That's your administrative agency.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,694.899,696.649,--is administratively reviewed.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.307,712.093,"And that is... but that is an appeal rather than a trial, de novo?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,712.093,714.061,"Well, the trial would go de novo."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.163,717.78,So it's not subject to review--
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,717.78,720.114,--an administrative consideration of whether the--
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.114,721.716,--First?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,728.287,728.804,--That's correct.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.804,730.172,And it's not a reviewing court?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,730.172,730.556,No.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.556,731.839,It's a trial court.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,732.489,737.843,The administrative review is simply--
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.843,738.762,A necessary provision preceding--
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,738.762,740.695,--a jurisdictional step to get to the district court.
1980.79-1734,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,740.695,744.564,--What does he have to prove in administrative?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,744.564,759.155,At the administrative level I think simply he would indicate the circumstances under which his property was lost and the Department of Correctional Services would have the option in this case of coming forward and providing their side of the story.
1980.79-1734,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,786.991,791.226,"And Mr. Brown, if he loses and has to go to district court, number one, does he get a jury trial?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,791.226,792.476,I don't believe he does; no.
1980.79-1734,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.476,796.597,And what does he have to prove in district court to recover?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,796.597,804.784,"In district court he would have to prove that there was negligence on the part of the State of Nebraska, or one of the employees of the State of Nebraska."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.405,815.742,"I suppose res ipsa loquitur would not be far away, would it?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,819.71,820.545,Right.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.286,837.338,And would negligence be an issue in the administrative proceeding as well?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,837.338,841.976,"Actually, their authority there is even broader than that."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.359,845.178,They could give him the money without--
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,845.178,852.85,"--If they felt that there was some inequity involved, even less than negligence, they certainly would have the authority to reimburse him at that point in time."
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.85,858.753,--What constitutional deprivation is alleged in this case?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,858.753,862.639,It was claimed that he was denied his property without due process of law.
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.639,871.411,"Contrary to the obligation of the State not to take his property without compensating him, is that it?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,871.411,872.145,I would answer--
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.145,873.347,"I mean, is that the way you understand it?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,873.347,875.463,--That's my understanding of it; yes.
1980.79-1734,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.463,881.701,But there was in effect an eminent domain case rather than a denial of due process?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,884.136,893.325,"Well, I guess in my evaluation of this, we aren't talking about an eminent domain case, because that is where the element of intent comes in."
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.53,934.736,But your answer to his claim consistently has been and it still is here that there is no denial of due process as long as the State has a suitable procedure to compensate him.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,934.736,936.338,--That's correct.
1980.79-1734,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.338,942.757,"So you're really saying that as long as we compensate him or replace it, there's been no denial of due process."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,942.757,943.757,That's our position; yes.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,943.757,951.113,"And that would be true whether the claim were a deprivation of property without due process of law, or a taking of property without compensation."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,951.113,952.43,That's correct.
1980.79-1734,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,952.43,959.286,"But here he seeks also $1,000 damages and also $1,000 punitive damages."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,959.286,960.019,That's correct.
1980.79-1734,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,960.019,962.071,Which he couldn't get in the claims court.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,962.071,964.455,"No, he could not get that in the claims court."
1980.79-1734,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,976.915,984.251,"Do you deny that somebody deprived somebody of $23 and you would fine him $2,000 for it?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,987.62,990.722,"That is, from a practical standpoint that's one of our serious concerns."
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.484,1068.585,"I take it, Mr. Brown, there are no provisions for fees under the state claimant procedure?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1069.27,1074.639,"Basically it proceeds simply as any other tort, state tort remedy."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.639,1080.226,"Well, then, as a practical matter, unless he can get free legal representation, he's not going to bring a lawsuit."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1089.432,1092.418,He certainly has the opportunity to proceed pro se.
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.418,1098.072,"But may I ask about the adequate... you're saying that's an adequate procedure, basically?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1117.668,1119.187,At the present time there were.
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1173.205,1182.128,"General Brown, does Nebraska still have the common law of torts practised in your courts?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1182.128,1184.896,I believe they do; yes.
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1184.896,1199.323,"Would a common law tort action and a lien against the individuals alleged to have been responsible for this loss, rather than against the State?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1199.323,1202.358,I guess that would be another portion of our argument.
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1211.214,1226.456,"Suppose one of the prison guards, for example, had an automobile accident resulting from his negligence when he was taking a prisoner to and from a court for hearing."
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1232.994,1233.777,I guess--
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1233.777,1234.494,Why not?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1234.494,1236.512,--I don't have the specific--
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1236.512,1249.506,Could you bring a damage suit if you were riding in my automobile and by gross negligence I caused an accident?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1251.372,1252.708,--I would assume so.
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1252.708,1266.065,"Well, what would the difference be, if a prisoner is riding in a prison vehicle to the court and the driver by gross negligence has an accident that results in injury to the prisoner?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1270.952,1272.535,I guess in the--
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1272.535,1273.121,Against the driver?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1278.606,1302.64,"--The difference, I suspect, basically, between the driver, between a correctional officer operating that vehicle, is more practical than legal, though I am not certain whether I can answer your question or not, because I have some concern as to whether or not the tort claim procedure might forestall that type of action against someone functioning as a state employee."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.592,1314.129,You think as a matter of state law it's possible that the injured party might be relegated to the administrative proceeding?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1314.129,1324.92,"I simply don't have an answer but I certainly... I guess from the State defense standpoint, that would be an issue I would certainly want to look into before I could give you a definite answer on that."
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1324.92,1327.539,"You say he has one remedy or the other, though?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1327.539,1330.358,There may be an election also.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.524,1333.726,"But he has some kind of remedy, you will concede that?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1333.726,1334.143,--Certainly.
1980.79-1734,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1336.395,1338.064,To compensate him for his personal injuries?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1338.064,1341.848,Right.
1980.79-1734,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.782,1426.87,Parratt was the superintendent of the correctional facility?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1426.87,1433.424,"Yes, chief executive officer; technically the warden of that particular institution."
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1467.13,1479.304,"Mr. Brown, if a prison guard stole an article of personal property from an inmate, what remedy would he have?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1479.304,1480.937,What remedy would the inmate have?
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1480.937,1482.306,Yes.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1496.247,1500.968,"Well, I think, first of all, what you have is an entirely different case than you have here."
1980.79-1734,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1503.67,1504.053,Right.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1504.053,1512.742,--and it's not our position that that type of act implicates the same problems we see with negligence.
1980.79-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1512.742,1518.945,"Well, does Nebraska have an action for conversion or the equivalent of the old common law conversion?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1521.031,1532.489,"I would think it would be, not to mention... this wouldn't aid... would not necessarily aid the inmate, but certainly we would, I think that would fall under our criminal laws as well."
1980.79-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.059,1547.765,"You seem to be conceding that, in my brother Powell's example, that would be a constitutional deprivation?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1547.765,1553.236,I'm basically saying that it presents a much closer case because we're dealing with an intentional act.
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.854,1558.604,"Well, why is it a closer case under your first argument?"
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1562.174,1562.541,--Certainly.
1980.79-1734,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.499,1578.183,--But your second argument seems to me to blend two different thoughts.
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1591.257,1595.895,"Well, okay, under these facts, I think I'm placed in a rather awkward position."
1980.79-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.94,1619.76,Are you prepared to assume negligence for your 1983 argument?
1980.79-1734,0,28965,j_kirk_brown,,1619.76,1621.21,"--For those purposes, yes."
1980.79-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.597,1630.132,Mr. Colleran.
1980.79-1734,1,33788,kevin_colleran,,1630.132,1635.053,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1734,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.253,1667.841,What difference would it make for the purposes of your case if you point that out?
1980.79-1734,1,33788,kevin_colleran,,1667.841,1669.157,"--The facts, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3443.083,3454.974,"Your Honor, first of all, I would like to point out again, since it came up in Mr. Colleran's argument, we do not look to the existence of the tort claims remedy as an affirmative defense."
1980.79-1734,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.87,3511.827,"Well, Didn't Monroe v. Pape say that 1983 is available, whether something is legitimate under state law or illegitimate under state law?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3511.827,3513.427,I guess I don't understand.
1980.79-1734,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.427,3523.768,"Well, I thought that's what that case held, and I thought that's what accounted for the multiplicity of 1983 suits that followed in its wake."
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3535.759,3538.161,"No, what I'm saying is that the--"
1980.79-1734,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3538.161,3542.147,So there doesn't need to be an abuse of state power.
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3542.147,3547.583,"--I would think, for liability, there does have to be some showing of an abuse of the power of the state."
1980.79-1734,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3551.652,3557.306,"What you mean is abuse of a power amounting to a violation of the Constitution, don't you?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3557.306,3559.808,Yes.
1980.79-1734,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3559.808,3567.93,"Your argument is that an abuse by way of negligence does not violate the Constitution, is that it?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3567.93,3568.314,Yes.
1980.79-1734,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3586.476,3591.512,"What if the property had been worth, instead of $23.50, $100,000?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3591.512,3594.497,I would make no distinction.
1980.79-1734,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3594.497,3600.085,Is it your position the Tort Claims Act is what takes care of that?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3600.085,3605.955,"I think our position, as we briefed it and it is today is that the Tort Claims Act provides that type of remedy."
1980.79-1734,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3619.647,3625.017,"In your brief you make a de minimis argument, and that argument wouldn't be available to you if the property were $100,000."
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3625.017,3632.006,I made that argument because I know that certain of the district court have employed that argument.
1980.79-1734,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3712.091,3719.795,"Could the State of Nebraska in its Constitution, from Federal Constitution, just abolish its hobby program totally?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3719.795,3722.195,I would suspect this would be one of the potentials.
1980.79-1734,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3736.888,3740.323,Are you indicating there are a lot of losses?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3744.96,3755.218,"--We wouldn't want to reevaluate, but certainly it would have to play a part in our thinking with regard to any material we allow to be introduced into the institution that is not constitutionally mandated."
1980.79-1734,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3758.47,3765.59,Would I be correct in assuming that you've already done something to correct somebody from stealing people's property?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3765.59,3767.956,"Well, we thought we had a system at that time, Your Honor."
1980.79-1734,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3771.058,3779.848,"Well, my final question is, why didn't you tell this man that he could get his remedy by the claims act?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3779.848,3780.882,My understanding is that he was informed.
1980.79-1734,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3783.384,3784.134,I see.
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3799.394,3802.013,That's very reasonable to assume.
1980.79-1734,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3802.013,3822.342,Could I ask you if you think the Court of Appeals was given an adequate opportunity to consider your suggestion that there was a procedure available to have this property paid for?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3822.342,3832.248,"Mr. Colleran is right in the fact that that issue was initially raised in our motion for rehearing, but I think, as it relates to such a basic issue, that they did have an opportunity to consider it."
1980.79-1734,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3836.034,3848.71,But is there anything in the record to indicate that this man was aware of the possibilities of this procedure within the time limits that the procedure requires?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3848.71,3868.638,"Well, I would point out to the Court, first of all... well, let me answer... with the exception of the Exhibit B, which I referred to earlier, which may or may not relate to the State claims now... or to the State tort claims, whether it relates to our small claims, and I don't know that that is distinguished, that's the only--"
1980.79-1734,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3868.638,3871.257,That was only when the complaint was filed?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3871.257,3872.725,--Right.
1980.79-1734,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3916.921,3922.475,Does the record show what the conversation was when he found out his property was lost?
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3930.579,3933.85,"--The record... I will grant you, the record in this case is very scanty."
1980.79-1734,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3954.696,3957.329,"Otherwise, the State just shrugged its shoulders?"
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3965.369,3975.358,"There simply is no showing on this record as to what happened, and I question the propriety of really informing you beyond that because, first of all, I was not personally involved in it."
1980.79-1734,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3975.358,3976.125,Yes; all right.
1980.79-1734,2,28965,j_kirk_brown,,3976.508,3979.41,And I think we ought to stick to what is on the record.
1980.79-1734,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3996.885,3997.552,"Thank you, gentlemen."
