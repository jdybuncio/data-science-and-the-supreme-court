1984.83-1842,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,82.342,"Mr. DeMassa, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,82.342,84.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1842,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.82,496.8,"Mr. DeMassa, may I inquire about the nature of the proof in Florida of the Washington offense?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,501.813,502.469,No.
1984.83-1842,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.469,512.184,And was it simply an introduction of the portion of the same evidence which had been introduced previously in Washington?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,512.934,515.355,No evidence was introduced in Washington either.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,547.857,556.15,"Well, was there other evidence limited just on the Florida charges?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,556.15,556.65,Yes--
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,556.65,559.509,Limited to activity and conduct in Florida?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,559.509,560.056,--Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.056,568.412,Independently of the evidence that you tell us came from the Washington inquiry?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,568.412,569.521,"Yes, there was."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,569.521,575.643,There could have been a conviction of these three without reference to the Washington material?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,575.643,577.189,"There might have been, Your Honor."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.435,593.573,"No, I am not talking about the CCE charge; the three independent... the two conspiracies and the telephone counts."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,599.93,606.256,--There was evidence that Petitioner was involved in other activity which could support the other three charges.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,660.344,672.557,"Well, did the government offer all this Washington State evidence affirmatively in support of the independent charges outside of the CCE?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,672.557,675.868,I believe it was offered as to the conspiracy of the import count also.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,675.868,677.226,Did they say it was?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,677.226,678.195,No.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.547,717.789,"Well, would you agree, if none of the three charges was tainted by any of the Washington evidence, that they might support the conviction on the CCE count... the conviction on the Florida three would be enough to support conviction on the CCE charge?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,717.789,723.24,"--If there was evidence that the jury did not consider the Neah Bay evidence, I would agree that those three would be sufficient."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,894.577,898.341,"Well, I come back then to the question I asked you earlier."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,906.448,906.963,Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,906.963,909.993,--without reference to what went on in the State of Washington?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,909.993,915.96,"My position would be that, since it is a substantive offense which is defined by the indictment, the answer would be no."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,915.96,917.163,It could not?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,917.163,917.85,Could not.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.01,945.587,Let's suppose what happened in Washington never happened--
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,945.587,947.259,"--If it never happened, then--"
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,947.259,950.321,--then would the charges made in Florida have sufficed?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,950.321,950.883,--Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,951.321,957.631,"But because something did happen in Washington, they had to introduce all of that evidence to prove the continuum."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,958.006,960.129,"They didn't have to introduce the evidence, Your Honor."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,971.53,981.902,"As I understand you, they could not have prosecuted him after they did in Washington, they could not prosecute him in Florida without introducing the Washington evidence."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,981.902,991.538,"--Well, my position is that they could not prosecute him in either case because you are segmenting up a substantive violation into more than one unit of prosecution."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.538,995.912,Now this you are applying only to the CCE count?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,995.912,996.646,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1004.846,1007.626,He was sentenced to 40 years on the CCE count?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1007.626,1010.687,--Consecutive to the Washington importation.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.544,1019.418,What did he plead guilty of in Washington?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1019.418,1024.384,He pled guilty in Washington to the importation of marijuana charge.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.384,1032.132,"Do you say, then, that the next day in Washington they could have convicted him for a conspiring to import?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1032.132,1033.225,Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.661,1038.941,Separately?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1038.941,1039.519,Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.219,1050.701,And you say the CCE charge is not a conspiracy charge?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1050.701,1052.061,It is not a conspiracy charge.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.061,1053.17,"But it takes an agreement, doesn't it?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1053.17,1061.776,"It requires concerted activity, but if it takes an agreement, who is the CCE defendant conspiring with who has the same intent that he does?"
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.774,1067.821,"Well, he has to have concerted activity with five--"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1067.821,1069.179,--Five or more persons.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.179,1070.163,--five or more persons.
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1070.413,1073.068,But those are not CCE defendants themselves.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.068,1073.74,"--Oh, I know."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1079.988,1081.94,Then he could be charged with conspiracy.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.94,1085.736,"But what does ""concerted activity"" mean?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1085.736,1090.218,It means a continuum of activity.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.917,1098.322,"Well, so they all have agreed to work together."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1098.322,1115.941,"Yes, but if they were all doing what a continuing enterprise defendant was doing, under the normal rules of a conspiracy they would be conspirators with a CCE defendant, and they cannot be guilty of conspiracy because they cannot have committed the same offense that a CCE defendant commits."
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.711,1155.473,"Well, even if you can't call it a ""conspiracy"", why shouldn't the same consequence flow from this strange animal as flows from a conspiracy?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1155.473,1160.469,Because you would need an agreement between the CCE defendant and another to commit the CCE.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.149,1189.849,"I suppose the real answer is that in this case you can prove all the agreements you want, but you can't prove the CCE offense without proving some predicate offenses."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1189.849,1192.161,--You need to necessarily include it.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.161,1194.816,"You need three, or however many you need."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1194.816,1199.861,"You need three completed crimes; and a conspiracy, by definition, is an inchoate--"
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.861,1200.611,And you don't need to prove those.
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1200.611,1201.25,--Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.25,1205.921,You don't need to prove any act except an agreement.
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1205.921,1208.451,All you need is an agreement with a conspiracy.
1984.83-1842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.207,1244.592,"Tell me again, Mr. DeMassa, your answer to Justice White's question conceding that the CCE offense, because it involved underlings rather than conspirators, is not the same as a conspiracy."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1250.809,1254.697,Why can't the CCE be treated as a conspiracy?
1984.83-1842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.697,1257.82,"Well, so far as the kind of arguments you're making."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1257.82,1262.678,Because you can't agree with the other five underlings to commit a CCE conspiracy.
1984.83-1842,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.678,1270.034,"That I realizes distinguishes it from a conspiracy, so it's A rather than B."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1276.752,1279.25,"I think the ultimate answer is, it's both."
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.999,1288.684,I think the answer is that you still have to prove the predicate offenses.
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1288.684,1289.059,Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1332.823,1343.395,"But you also argue, do you, that the conspiracy counts here... even if there were nothing about Washington involved in this case... could not be predicate offenses for the CCE count?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1343.395,1344.973,My problem is it becomes--
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.973,1346.269,Don't you argue that?
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1346.269,1346.534,--Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1346.534,1351.564,"You say, a conspiracy conviction is not a completed offense."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1351.923,1355.172,It is an agreement; it is a completed offense once there's an agreement.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1360.716,1362.169,"Well, could they then be predicate offenses?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1362.169,1363.731,--They could be predicate offenses.
1984.83-1842,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1363.731,1364.106,All right.
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1364.106,1377.741,"But they have to find that there's substantial resources obtained; that he was an organizer in those conspiracies... the problem is, there was a motion for bill of particulars in this case to find out what the particulars were about the government's theory."
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.158,1406.277,"If all the jury used the Washington evidence for was to prove the conspiracy to import or to possess or whatever it is, there wouldn't be any Double Jeopardy problem there, would there?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1406.277,1407.371,--There might not.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.838,1408.775,"Well, might not?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1413.556,1415.321,"--Well, my argument basically--"
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.321,1416.289,"Well, isn't that right?"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1416.289,1417.242,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.083,1428.94,"I thought awhile ago you said that you could convict for the substantive offense, and then you can convict separately for the conspiracy to--"
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1428.94,1429.128,--Yes.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.128,1430.563,--Albernaz.
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1430.563,1431.72,But not under the CCE.
1984.83-1842,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.044,1451.524,"But if there had only been one charge in this case... forget the CCE for a minute... if there had only been one charge, namely the conspiracy charge, they could have used the Washington evidence to prove the conspiracy."
1984.83-1842,0,37830,philip_a_demassa,,1451.524,1455.211,"Yes, because the conspiracy is different than the Washington evidence."
1984.83-1842,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1461.349,1466.598,Mr. Levy.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1466.598,1472.611,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1570.04,1573.305,I thought he originally conceded that and then walked away from that concession.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1573.305,1578.13,"--Well, perhaps your understanding is better than mine, but my understanding is what I just stated."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1578.13,1580.458,"I had thought that before argument, but I think he changed his position today."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1580.458,1595.951,But the central question here is whether importation of marijuana and continuing criminal enterprise become the same offense because that importation is used in a given case as one of the predicates for CCE.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.647,1626.798,"May I ask, Mr. Levy, just to get it out early, supposing... unlike the facts of this case... you had only two other substantive offenses that could be proved in Florida instead of the multiple group you have, would your position be the same?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1626.798,1629.235,"Well, our principal position would be the same there--"
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.235,1637.545,"In other words, you had only three predicate offenses, one of which was the Washington situation, would you still make the same argument?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1637.545,1638.702,--Our principal argument would be the same.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.888,1652.696,"Well, if all three of the predicate offenses you sought to prove in Florida had been previously prosecuted, you would make the same argument?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1652.696,1653.915,Our argument would indeed be the same.
1984.83-1842,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1672.938,1683.902,And I gather that you'd argue there was absolutely no taint by the Washington evidence of the Florida substantive offense part of it.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1684.793,1687.182,"That is secondary, but that is also part of our principal argument."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.645,1741.958,"Mr. Levy, is that a valid argument?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1747.284,1754.062,"There is an exception for that, but we think this case goes well beyond that, and that that's appropriate in light of the nature of the CCE offense."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.062,1761.794,"I thought your argument basically was, even if the government is aware of the whole panorama of activities, it can still divide up the prosecution in this way."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1761.794,1762.794,We take that position--
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.794,1763.449,Yes.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1763.449,1767.682,"--but in most cases, it will in fact be the situation that the government is not aware of that situation."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.275,1771.54,"Well, in that case, our cases have suggested there's an exception to the rule."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1771.54,1775.489,"--There is, although that exception is exceedingly difficult to apply in practice."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.238,1780.847,I'm surprised you start out with that argument.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1780.847,1786.002,"Well, I just simply want to give the Court some idea of the practical dimensions of the Petitioner's argument."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.96,1970.317,"May I ask, your hypothetical here is assuming many more than three predicate offenses."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1979.829,1983.406,"--All right, we would take the position that that does not violate Double Jeopardy."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.406,1987.982,"You see, your hypothetical is you say you've got myriad offenses, and obviously you have no problem in that case."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1987.982,1992.731,That wasn't a hypothetical; those are the facts of this case: that the Petitioner engaged in myriad criminal activities.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.275,2000.399,"Then under that argument, Blockburger is satisfied."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2002.554,2012.066,"We don't think it can be said in the area of compound and predicate offenses that Blockburger is either satisfied or not satisfied; or, alternatively, it is satisfied and not satisfied at the same time."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.126,2028.232,"Well, you clearly would have avoided the problem with this case, would you not, if the trial judge had said: You must find three predicate offenses, but don't use the incident in Seattle as one of the three?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2028.232,2030.732,"At a minimum, that would have avoided Double Jeopardy."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.732,2031.747,That clearly would have avoided the whole problem.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2031.747,2032.684,But the reason for that is--
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.684,2038.698,"And as I understand your argument, you could easily have won the case under such an instruction."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2038.698,2045.461,"--We could have in this case, but we don't think it was necessary that such an instruction be given because the predicate offenses and CCE are the same."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.512,2118.089,"Well, isn't it true that whenever the government established the CCE it would necessarily establish three predicate offenses?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2118.089,2122.211,"It would establish three predicates, but we wouldn't know which predicates, and they would be different for each case."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.211,2125.101,"Well, but in murder and manslaughter, maybe the manslaughter charge was somebody else."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2129.96,2133.863,"You could, but if you have a murder of A, you will also necessarily have a manslaughter of A."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.863,2137.549,"And if you have a CCE, you will necessarily have three predicate offenses."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2137.549,2153.293,"You will have three predicates, but we don't think those predicates will be lesser included offenses in the same sense of murder and manslaughter, or armed bank robbery and bank robbery, and the other kinds of traditional lesser and greater offenses for which Blockburger was designed to advance the Double Jeopardy analysis."
1984.83-1842,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.293,2157.76,"Well, Blockburger really didn't advance any Double Jeopardy analysis at all."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2158.932,2161.914,It relied on cases such as Gavayares.
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.558,2200.883,"Mr. Levy, it sounds to me like you would say that a state could make a separate crime of being a repeat offender."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2217.768,2220.986,Let me say first that CCE is not such a statute.
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.688,2222.922,Why isn't it like that?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2222.922,2226.547,--Because you need to prove a great many other things than simply the series of offenses.
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.639,2228.092,"Oh, I understand that."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2238.557,2240.149,"--With respect to a Double Jeopardy objection, we would."
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.102,2245.897,"Well, wouldn't you have to say that you would in order to succeed in your present argument?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2245.897,2246.897,Not in the present argument.
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.969,2273.824,"Just making a separate crime out of having committed three previous felonies, that would not be subject to attack under the Double Jeopardy clause?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2273.824,2274.449,--I believe that's correct.
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.901,2280.867,Do some states have such crimes on the books for habitual offenders?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2280.867,2284.975,"--I am not aware of them, but I can't give a conclusive answer to that."
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.975,2289.943,"Well, the usual one is they just enhance the penalty for the third--"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2289.943,2293.894,"That's correct, and the defendant would not have been previously prosecuted for the one that is at issue."
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2298.142,2303.859,--But they nevertheless allow proof of the previous convictions.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2303.859,2307.794,"Yes, they do, and this Court has long held that there is no Double Jeopardy problem with such a statute."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.389,2391.778,"Mr. Levy, manslaughter won't always involve an automobile."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2391.778,2396.01,"No, but I think the Illinois charge in that case did involve manslaughter with an automobile."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.01,2397.463,"The charge, or the statute?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2397.463,2403.773,I believe the statute had a different section for manslaughter with an automobile and the charge was brought under that.
1984.83-1842,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2424.061,2429.746,What do you think the word Mr. Levy?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2432.558,2445.115,"--I'm not entirely sure, and the Court did not explain it, but I think the best reading is that the Court couldn't come to a conclusive determination of the Double Jeopardy claim, because that claim turned on the nature of the state law offenses."
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.885,2686.97,"Well, I suppose you could always say that when the first felony is committed, it's not a lesser included offense of anything, I suppose, and it certainly isn't a lesser included offense of a CCE when the first one happens."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2689.33,2691.0,That's correct.
1984.83-1842,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.2,2707.947,"Well, usually a lesser included offense is always... as soon as it happens, you know it's a lesser included offense with something else."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2707.947,2708.509,That's right.
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2729.406,2740.294,"Well, Mr. Levy, what if the defendant had gone to trial in Washington on the importation of marijuana offense and been acquitted?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2748.977,2751.242,Let me start with an easier answer.
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2758.848,2759.348,Why?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2759.348,2763.425,It would be collateral estoppel or res judicata in the truest sense.
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2764.815,2766.284,Nothing to do with Double Jeopardy?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2766.284,2776.623,"--To the extent that those concepts are embraced in Double Jeopardy, it would have some constitutional basis; but it is not the same kind of Double Jeopardy issue that we're discussing in this case."
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2779.42,2788.617,"Could you use the same evidence to support other aspects, such as the association with five or more people--"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2788.617,2789.68,--Our position is that we could.
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2789.68,2790.93,--or something of that sort?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2791.835,2797.115,Certainly to prove conspiracy as a separate offense there would be no problem with that.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.784,2809.906,"Mr. Levy, can I go back to Justice White's hypothetical suggesting that you always look at the lesser included issue when the minor offense is committed."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2827.961,2834.646,"We don't think the same act or transaction requires that the offenses occur at the exact second, but we do think that they need to occur--"
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.646,2841.222,"What I am suggesting is, in order to make the analysis all of the offenses that you are comparing have to have been committed at the time you make the comparison."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2847.36,2849.406,--Presumably it would.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.406,2850.093,And the government would know it.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2850.093,2858.841,"That it would have occurred, but we think it is fundamentally different to say that, in your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, the robbery and the murder occurred in the same course of criminal conduct."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2863.807,2873.818,"But what is the difference between using the unit of transaction, the whole event in the store robbery that I described, or the unit of transaction as three drug offenses followed by everything else you need to commit the CCE?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2873.818,2875.583,--We think that there is a much different--
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.583,2877.363,What is the difference?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2877.363,2879.598,--The difference is the nature of the offenses involved.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.516,2888.859,"Does it have a role... well, go ahead."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2889.218,2891.624,"The language of the Constitution is ""same offense""."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.668,2901.948,And the greater is not completed until the ten-minute period has expired--
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2901.948,2902.886,--That may be--
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.886,2905.838,--and here with this offense it takes maybe six months instead of ten minutes.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2905.838,2906.43,"--Six months, or six years--"
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2906.43,2908.743,So is there a constitutional difference between six months and ten minutes?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2908.743,2916.91,"--Well, we think if you're looking at what the language of the Constitution's ""same offense"" can mean, we think there is a difference between offenses that may occur in one episode ten minutes apart--"
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.91,2918.113,What about a kidnapping?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2919.924,2923.267,"--Well, the kidnapping is a continuing thing."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.267,2927.671,"Yes, and I'm talking then it's a felony... and it becomes a murder at the time of the felony murder at the time of the killing."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2927.671,2931.561,"At the instant at which you kill him, you are still guilty of kidnapping."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.561,2935.887,"But you don't have a lesser included offense until the end of the six months, is what I'm suggesting."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2935.887,2936.215,That's correct.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.215,2936.981,Why is it different?
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2936.981,2944.103,It's different because in its nature CCE does not occur in the same time frame in the same place.
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.103,2945.117,"Six months, in both cases."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2945.117,2954.942,"Well, in your hypothetical, let me go on to say, we don't think that murder and kidnapping would be the same offense either."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.626,2965.172,"Well, an accidental killing at the end of a six-month period of kidnapping someone would be a felony murder."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2965.172,2966.359,"Yes, that--"
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.359,2972.606,"--might not be a murder without the kidnapping, and the greater offense is the murder, and the lesser included offense is the kidnapping."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2974.449,2983.18,"--Well, in our analysis we think you are incorrect, that the kidnapping would not be a lesser included offense as that term is used in the Double Jeopardy area."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.261,3016.713,"Your position really requires us to overrule the cases you discussed in that one footnote, Hayes, and one other."
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3016.713,3017.651,I'm sorry?
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3019.4,3019.994,Harris.
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3023.336,3048.966,"I don't believe so, although those opinions were quite brief, and it is hard to know exactly the basis for the Court's decision, but we think they can be most sensibly read as resting on the premise that the felony... that the felony murder was an aggravated form of the underlying felony where death ensued, which is what the Court later actually held as to the D.C. felony murder statute in Whelan, and it is also the explanation that the Court gave in Vitalle for the Harris against Oklahoma decision."
1984.83-1842,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3052.589,3055.479,"Well, they relied on Nielson, I think, didn't they?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3055.479,3059.93,"They did rely on Nielson, that's correct, and Nielson is a case that's a bit hard to follow."
1984.83-1842,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3066.381,3071.223,"Well, Nielson antedated Blockburger by decades, didn't it?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3071.223,3084.936,"--In its formal structure, but we think the approach they followed was similar to what was later adopted in Blockburger, and that the difficulty in Nielson is that the Court did not simply look at the elements on the face of the statute, but it looked at the statutory elements as it construed them."
1984.83-1842,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.58,3122.389,"May I ask right there, you're saying that it could not contend, for example in this case, that CCE is an aggravated form of the offense committed in Seattle?"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3122.389,3124.951,That depends on the statute that Congress passed.
1984.83-1842,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3189.159,3199.03,"But Jeffers, the Jeffers vs. United States case, determined that Congress did not intend cumulative penalties to be--"
1984.83-1842,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3199.03,3200.513,We think Jeffers is fundamentally different.

1984.83-1842,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3444.212,3450.334,Why isn't the CCE statute analogous to an habitual offender statute?
1984.83-1842,2,37830,philip_a_demassa,,3450.334,3474.715,"Because, in order to have an habitual offender statute or a recedivist statute, you are putting an offender who is offending more than once on notice by his prior convictions for nonrelated offenses that his subsequent act and subsequent conduct in a new offense unrelated to his prior offenses is going to cumulatively punish him, is going to greater punish him for the new offense."
1984.83-1842,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3474.715,3483.103,"Well, why doesn't this statute put a defendant on notice that if he continues to commit drug offenses, he might be charged with--"
1984.83-1842,2,37830,philip_a_demassa,,3483.103,3484.18,It does.
