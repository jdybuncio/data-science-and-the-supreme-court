1975.74-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.708,"We will hear arguments next in number 74-759, United States against Moore."
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,46.044,49.079,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.231,360.279,Did he fill the prescriptions himself?
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,360.279,374.317,"No, what did was he wrote out the prescription for whatever amounts you want it and you paid for the prescription, you then went to a drug store and had the prescription filled and paid again for the druggist's fee."
1975.74-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.016,394.627,So his escalating rate for the difference in numbers in the prescription could not be attributed to the filling of the prescription by him?
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,394.627,399.153,"That is right, it had nothing to do with the cost of the particular tablet."
1975.74-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.369,419.484,In what period?
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,419.484,424.674,Five-and-one-half month period from September ’71 to February of ’72 when he was closed down.
1975.74-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,424.674,429.736,How did that relate to the appearance before the Grand Jury?
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,429.736,444.683,"The appearance before the Grand Jury was back in ’69 when he promised to make the change in his form of treatment and for a time he apparently did or at least was not detected, if he did not and he did have a registration to engage in detoxification."
1975.74-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.38,497.3,"Mr. Friedman, was not all that agreed to in the Court of Appeals?"
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,497.3,500.309,"All these facts, absolutely, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,500.309,503.051,There is one about the time he spent and all?
1975.74-759,0,37907,paul_l_friedman,,503.051,521.183,"Well I think it is important to put this in a proper factual context and to show really how Congress could not possibly have intended, that people that engage in this kind of a egregious conduct should be exempt from felony prosecution for distributing or selling narcotics."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1570.805,1575.565,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.902,1673.586,Are you suggesting that he may have not known that the statue was not clear enough --
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1673.586,1674.519,"No, I am not suggesting --"
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.519,1676.556,-- known he was violating it?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1676.556,1689.299,"I am suggesting that the statute itself is not only susceptible of and permits of the interpretation of the Court below, but I suggest requires it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.152,1696.995,"Do you relate that to how he acted on it, I am trying to see whether you are relating that in some way --"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1696.995,1700.85,"I am having difficulty with your word, he, you mean Judge Bazelon or Dr. Moore?"
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1700.85,1705.87,"No, no, Dr. Moore."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1705.87,1722.91,"First of all let me preface by saying that I think no one, either the counsel who represented Dr. Moore in the Trial Court or those of us who represented upon appeal, are going to seek to justify what Dr. Moore did."
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.328,1727.357,"Was he misled by the statute, that is the only one, I am not concerned --"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1727.357,1729.846,Dr. Moore was not misled by the statute.
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.846,1730.965,That is all I am interested --
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1730.965,1734.736,"No, I am not suggesting for a moment that Dr. Moore was misled by the statute."
1975.74-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1771.09,1776.807,"Mr. Bergan, I gather there are four other Circuits who reached the opposite conclusion, did they not?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1776.807,1780.019,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I think the number is six --"
1975.74-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1780.019,1784.903,"Was it six, well, I know First, Fifth, Tenth and Ninth so the two --"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1784.903,1794.866,"I believe the Seventh Circuit has recently so held and I am unclear about the Sixth, but I believe that is the other one, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1794.866,1798.863,So that leaves the District Columbia Circuit standing alone --
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1798.863,1815.649,"The District of Columbia Circuit stands alone with a dissenting opinion from Judge Eli in the Ninth Circuit recently in the Rosenberg case, which was decided, well, probably about the time that this Court granted certiorari in this case."
1975.74-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1815.649,1829.231,"I gather the question that you see it is, the one you just, before I asked my question, whether or not the prescription limits a registered physician to whatever may be the penalties for violation of this legislation?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1829.231,1832.057,"That is right, Mr. Justice Brennan, I think that is the precise issue."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.365,1972.418,Mr. Bergan.
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1972.418,1973.781,Yes sir.
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.781,1985.142,"Before you get to the legislative history, how do you, in the statute itself, discern this division into two universes as you are speaking?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1985.142,1991.315,"Primarily, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the language of Section 841 --"
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.315,1995.603,That is 401 in US code?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1995.603,2009.688,"Mr. Justice I am sorry, I do not know, my friend says the answer to that is yes, but I am using the references in the -- that were used in the opinion of the court below and the ones that we have used in the brief."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.486,2029.473,By this title?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2029.473,2030.661,"Right, by this title."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.577,2101.472,"Does not 401 (a) except as authorized, by this title it shall be unlawful for any person and then proscribes a series of acts, does not that suggest that the exception is in terms of acts, or conduct, rather than in terms of persons?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2101.472,2128.602,"No, I think not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and I think not for the reason that those Acts and I take it you are referring to the provisions of subdivision-1 and subdivision-2, manufacture, distribute, dispense that particular language, those are the acts which are covered by the classes of persons who are permitted to register to do those acts under the preceding sections of the statute."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.04,2166.238,"Subsection-2 of 841, where it is made unlawful to create, distribute or dispense or posses with intent to distribute or dispense a counterfeit substance."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2170.279,2185.427,"No, there is no provision that I know of in the statute that would authorize the registration of physicians or anyone else, pharmacists or manufacturers, or whatever to create, distribute, or dispense counterfeit substances."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.427,2194.705,"But they could not be prosecuted, a doctor could not be prosecuted under 841 (2) under your theory, even though he dispenses a counterfeit substance."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2194.705,2205.522,"No, I suggest that --Mr. Justice Rehnquist, perhaps I have not made my theory clear, let me put it this way."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.325,2244.665,"But then it is conduct that you are talking about, it is authorization of conduct, not just the fact that the guy has an MD license?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2244.665,2247.242,It is not the fact that he has an MD license.
1975.74-759,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2266.117,2278.683,"The statue with be more helpful to you if it instead it is referring to any person, it referred to any person other than a registrant I suppose?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2278.683,2289.617,"I suggest that if the statute said that, Mr. Justice Blackmun, there would be no ambiguity and the answer to your suggestion is yes, it would be more helpful to me if I said that."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2329.066,2340.053,"Suppose Dr. Moore, in his office, dispensed methadone at $25.00 a shot, could he be guilty?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2343.647,2345.967,"I am sorry now, I am not sure I understand your question --"
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.967,2357.228,"Anybody off the street, he has got a big sign out, “methadone for sale” cheap drug dispensed it within his neighborhood, Dr. Moore."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2357.228,2359.176,He has got a BNDD registration?
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.176,2360.344,Yes.
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2360.344,2377.889,"I suggest, Mr. Justice Marshall, that as long as that BNDD is in effect, the answer is to revoke that registration and then prosecute him if he keeps doing it because that is the dichotomy, which I suggest that the Congress set up."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.889,2380.157,You mean Congress deliberately set that up?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2380.157,2381.735,I believe that Congress --
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.735,2386.772,Set that up that the doctors are the only that can violate the law and sell the drug --
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2386.772,2387.66,No.
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.66,2389.182,-- and not violate the statute?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2389.182,2406.006,"No, no, it would apply to wholesalers, manufacturers, pharmacists, all others who are authorized or who can be authorized by Bureau of Narcotic and Dangerous Drug registration to deal in narcotics."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.006,2415.408,A wholesaler can sell a million dollars worth of methadone to the mafia and that he cannot be convicted?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2415.408,2420.687,"No I -- you put a case, Mr. Justice Marshal, that I have never focused on, I would --"
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.687,2430.187,"I am only -- well, he sells a quarter of a million which is what this case is about, you mean, he could not be touched?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2430.187,2433.293,I am not at all sure that I can answer that question.
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2452.206,2455.21,So he just takes his quarter of a million and goes to Europe again?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2455.21,2455.365,He --
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.365,2468.852,"Mr. Bergan, it seems to me that the -- you rest on the provisions of 841 which say, except as authorized, and then 822 (b) has headed authorized activities."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2484.55,2485.31,That is correct.
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.31,2496.57,"Now let us -- now it seems to me we must then ask what did the -- what did their registration authorized them to do, right under the plain words of 822 (b)."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2505.453,2509.62,"No, obviously it is not a willy-nilly authorization to do everything."
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.62,2521.827,"Well, then it seems to me that the except as authorized language at 841 does not held you at all, although if you do something in selling methadone that is not authorized by your registration?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2521.827,2530.134,"But my registration, or Dr. Moore’s registration in this case, authorized him to dispense methadone, that was the limitation of it, sir."
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.134,2537.051,"It authorized him to dispense methadone, in some way other than by prescription?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2537.051,2540.51,"Oh! No, by prescription, well I suppose --"
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.51,2543.898,Let us take Justice -- Mr. Justice Marshall’s example.
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2550.129,2554.634,Assuming his registration was limited to by prescription that would not be authorized.
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.894,2559.662,"Well then, he can be prosecuted under 841, even under your theory?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2559.662,2562.786,Because he was not authorized to do what he then did.
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.786,2566.971,"That is the answer to Mr. Justice Marshall, he just was not authorized to do that."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2566.971,2570.412,"Well, if that is the situation, yes, to the extent so authorized."
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.412,2581.049,"Well, now think of a situation where -- where he gives prescriptions, but he just does not act like a doctor."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2595.066,2600.046,"One must be a physician to be -- to have the type of authorization, which Dr. Moore had."
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.061,2611.48,"At least the Government is contending, I gather, that he just acted outside the scope of the ordinary conduct of a physician?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2611.48,2613.226,I think that is the heart and soul of the Government’s contention.
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.226,2621.97,"And therefore is no more covered by the exception in 841, then would be selling without a prescription?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2621.97,2626.351,"Well, I believe that is what their case comes down to, Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.351,2633.802,But you apparently agree that he could be breached under 841 if he sold without a prescription?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2633.802,2651.651,"Yes, on the assumption that his -- that his, let us take an easy example, if he went to the playground at Central High School and sold methadone then the answer to your question would be, yes."
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.413,2692.679,"Mr. Bergan, on this question of what a doctor can do, I suppose hypothetically you would agree that, or perhaps you would not, that the old practice of bleeding patients which was done 150 to 200 years ago is, let us assume it is no longer accepted in medical practice, I --"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2692.679,2696.498,"I suppose we can assume that together, I would take that --"
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.498,2720.141,"-- because I do not know, but there was doctor who just simply took his some kind of a knife and cut-up one of his patient’s arteries and then just went out to play golf and let the patient die on the place where he had left him."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2735.123,2737.339,I think not at all.
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2743.238,2751.788,"Undoubtedly, in such a case the prosecution would bring in physicians who would testify that that was not accepted practice."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2779.047,2784.039,"I think it differs markedly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-759,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2953.834,2957.835,Even though such an 841 refers to any person?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2957.835,2959.282,"Yes, yes."
1975.74-759,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2959.282,2969.37,"So that in effect you are saying, and I guess I am trying to be facetious, that a physician is not a person within the meaning of that Section at least?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,2969.37,2971.29,"No, I am not saying that."
1975.74-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.338,3000.243,"Mr. Bergan even though I was thinking, that certainly is -- was a subject of congressional concern so also, was it not a concern that among the worst abusers in the drug traffic field were physicians."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3000.243,3001.505,There was that concern.
1975.74-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.797,3030.196,"But to do it I suppose, Congress must have thought consistently with the authorization they had to do?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3030.196,3038.223,"And the authorization, if Your Honor please in this instance, was to dispense by means of prescription a Schedule II narcotic."
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.223,3047.449,"Do you think there is any significance, Mr. Bergan, in the fact that 841 is entitled, “Prohibited Acts?”"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3047.449,3051.419,"No, I do not find any significance in the title."
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.182,3129.063,Just let me ask you.
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3143.822,3148.547,"Yes, I think it could Mr. Justice White --"
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.547,3158.55,"Do you think the Government is wrong in saying that unless he is liable under 841, he is not liable at all for the specific conduct that for which he was convicted in this case?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3158.55,3163.837,Well I am not terribly sure that the Government is taking that position.
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3201.483,3205.135,"Mr. Bergan, he did more than that."
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3210.207,3215.96,"I quite agree, Mr. Justice Marshall, but he did not do more which the Congress said he could be prosecuted for."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.96,3227.094,"You mean if he had sold himself a quarter of a million of dollars worth of methadone to anybody in the world, in his office, he could not be prosecuted?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3227.094,3240.058,"If that is what he was -- if that is what he was authorized by BNDD to do, Mr. Justice Marshall, then I would answer that question he could not be prosecuted under 841 (a)."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3240.058,3246.336,What statue authorized him to dispense methadone to anybody under any circumstances?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3246.336,3260.725,"His registration by the Attorney General of the United States, pursuant to Section 822 (b) of the statute, authorized him to dispense or prescribe methadone without limitation."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3261.973,3265.477,"In my case, what it was not prescribed, he just sold it?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3265.477,3267.386,He prescribed methadone.
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3267.386,3271.046,"I said assuming that he just sold it, you said it would be the same?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3271.046,3276.576,"Well, I am sorry, I have misinterpreted your question then, if your --"
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3276.576,3290.299,"If the people come in and he says, here I will sell you $35.00 worth of methadone, it violates the statute, the same doctor with the same registration, right?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3290.299,3296.279,"If he sold it without the prescription, and if his authorization was to prescribe --"
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3296.279,3312.044,"No, no, he got the same authorization he has got now, and the man comes in and says I would like to buy some methadone for 35 bucks, and he says okay here is $35.00 worth of methadone, did he or did he not violate the statute?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3312.044,3322.661,"That is a different case than we have, Mr. Justice Marshal, but the answer to your question I think very candidly is yes, the Government would have a better case of prosecuting that particular person --"
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3322.661,3325.535,"But if you have a good case, he could be prosecuted?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3325.535,3330.43,"The Government would have a better case of prosecuting him under Section 841, it would depend sir --"
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3330.43,3344.141,"If the man comes in and says I want $35.00 worth of methadone, he says I cannot give you the methadone, but he had the prescription, that is it and he could, he cannot be prosecuted?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3344.141,3356.144,"One would have to examine the particular facts of that case, but as you put the case, if he is authorized by BNDD so to do, he could not be prosecuted under 841."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3364.147,3368.361,Doctors have different authorizations?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3372.976,3376.957,"I am not sure of that, Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not know the answer to that."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3384.313,3386.562,I am talking about medical doctor?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3386.562,3388.711,"I am talking of a medical doctor, sir."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3388.711,3393.029,"If he practices as a physician, you mean each physician has a different authorization?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3393.029,3399.436,"No, I do not mean that each has a different authorization, but there are differing types of authorizations."
1975.74-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3410.981,3414.259,What did Dr. Moore had?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3414.259,3426.192,"My answer to your question is the same, sir, that the question that you posed, that doctor who sold did not prescribe could be subject to prosecution under 841."
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3426.192,3436.098,"Mr. Bergan, you are not seeking to uphold the reasoning of the Court of Appeals there, are you, your argument does not track that of the Court of Appeals?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3436.098,3442.089,"It does not track it directly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think it parallels it, but --"
1975.74-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3442.089,3458.97,"But the Court of Appeals in effect said that if you are a registrant, you could not be prosecuted under 841 and you are saying that if you are a registrant, you might be prosecuted under 841 if you exceed the authority conferred by your registration?"
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3458.97,3461.785,If you act outside your registration.
1975.74-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3467.405,3474.25,The Court of Appeals spoke much more broadly than your theory?
1975.74-759,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,3474.25,3479.587,"Well they painted it with a very broad brush, I certainly have to concede that Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3480.212,3481.279,Thank you Mr. Bergan.
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3483.088,3488.986,Just two quick comments.
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3524.235,3535.174,(Inaudible) that the Government suggests how prosecutors ought to know what registrants may be prosecuted under 841 and what registrants may not?
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3535.174,3536.287,I am not sure I understand that.
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3536.287,3547.594,"Well, I gather your position here is that this one is so beyond the pale of the registration that the clearly he may be prosecuted under 841."
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3555.937,3571.301,"I think you have to look at the evidence of the case, in each case, and if you look at the evidence in the cases that are now pending under cert in this Court, the Rosenberg case and the Green case and the Jin Fuey Moy case, you will find that in each case it is completely blatant, and that the uncover agents where they were at --"
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3571.301,3572.738,(Inaudible) was completely blatant?
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3572.738,3577.476,"Well, there is no legitimate medical purposes of the test outside the course of professional practice."
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.476,3597.913,"You are not -- on your theory of the relationship between 841 and 822, it seems to me that you could just as well argue that any violation of the provisions of regulating a registrant would be reachable under 841, anyone, you do not suggest that?"
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3597.913,3598.949,"No, there are two --"
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3598.949,3600.069,(Inaudible) you do not suggest that?
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3600.069,3600.742,Yes.
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3600.742,3602.556,You are representing that Government does not suggest?
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3602.556,3603.384,Yes.
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.384,3609.612,"That for some violations that their registration, they may not be prosecuted under 841?"
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3609.612,3612.037,They are permitted to dispense --
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3612.037,3619.236,"No, my question is whether for some violation registrants nevertheless may not be prosecuted under 841?"
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3619.236,3624.784,"If it is a technical and formal violation of their registrations, they are liable under 842 and 843 --"
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3624.784,3626.078,What is technical and formal (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3626.078,3628.295,"Well, Congress set it out in the legislative history."
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3638.411,3640.407,Not using a prescription?
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3640.407,3642.079,Let me give you the exact --
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3642.079,3648.534,"Your colleague here suggested that if he does not dispense with the prescription, he would be reached under 841?"
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3648.534,3666.709,"842 (a) (1) says that you are subject to one-year penalty if you distribute or dispense in violation of 829, and 829 requires that you cannot dispense without the written prescription?"
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3666.709,3674.439,"You would say that is a technical violation, and if you just started, if you just put up the sign and just start selling --"
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3674.439,3678.717,"No, because then it is not for any legitimate medical purpose in the course of professional practice."
1975.74-759,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3678.965,3680.396,What if another criteria --
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3680.396,3683.941,Well it is in the statute -- but that is in the statue.
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3736.048,3743.834,You say this is no worst -- no tougher test on the physicians than just the ordinary law on any kind of practice.
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3749.585,3751.141,I think that is right.
1975.74-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3751.141,3758.589,"Well, Civil liability is one thing and 45 years in penitentiary is something a little different."
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3761.837,3763.864,"Yes, but we are not talking about negligence or malpractice --"
1975.74-759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3763.864,3766.812,"But that is what Justice White I think was talking about, maybe I misunderstood."
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3766.812,3768.373,"Well, maybe I misunderstood."
1975.74-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3768.373,3774.952,Then what you are suggesting though in these other provisions that if for no legitimate medical purpose?
1975.74-759,2,37907,paul_l_friedman,,3774.952,3780.585,"That is right, that is what the regulation say, that is what the statue says and that is what the decisions of this Court say."
1975.74-759,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3800.835,3803.339,"Thank you Mr. Bergan, thank you Mr. Friedman."
