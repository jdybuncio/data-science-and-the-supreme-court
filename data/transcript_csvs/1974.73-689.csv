1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.398,"We'll hear arguments next in number 73-689, Maness against Meyers."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,40.398,42.845,Mr. Chief Justice Burger.
1974.73-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,248.509,251.524,Has Mr. Maness chosen to go that route?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,251.524,257.827,"No, Mr. Maness chose to come to the Supreme Court because he felt that it was important enough that this Court decide it."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,277.51,278.132,Sir?
1974.73-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.132,280.971,Could he go to Judge Roberts now?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,280.971,302.519,"Well, I don't know that he could, having come here, but Judge Roberts has decided Mr. Maley's case and decided it in what I think is a simple lucid short opinion that is obvious that a lawyer has a right to tell someone that, in his opinion, you have a right to exercise a constitutional right."
1974.73-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,302.519,305.258,Is there an appeal pending from Judge Roberts' decision?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,305.258,305.877,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,306.981,307.108,Then we held--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,307.108,314.196,And the Fifth Circuit is holding it in the bench pending this Court's decision of Mr. Maness' case.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.196,331.37,"Had this been a criminal right to counsel case, I suppose the right of the lawyer to express his views on a constitutional right could be based on the provision of the constitution that support the right of counsel but, in a civil proceeding, what is the precise basis with that?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,331.37,334.665,"Your Honor, you understand there was a criminal prosecution pending."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.665,335.299,"Yes, but this was--"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,335.299,337.241,Separately from this.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.241,338.485,"This was a civil proceeding, was it not?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,338.485,346.054,"But had the evidence been made available in the civil proceeding, it obviously would've been available in the criminal proceeding."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.054,354.097,"Well, do you contend that the defendant in the civil proceeding had a consti-- a federal constitutional right to counsel?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,354.097,357.261,"Well, Your Honor, he had a constitutional right to counsel."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.874,359.028,"Well, would you--"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,359.028,365.793,"I think a citizen in any case has a constitutional right, if he's employed counsel, to have a lawyer working for him."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.973,372.28,Well--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,372.28,387.704,And that the lawyer's focus was as much concerned with that pending criminal case as it was with the civil case which became the genesis of this action.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.704,391.055,"But this was a civil proceeding, wasn't it?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,391.055,404.29,"This was a civil proceeding alleging the commission of a criminal offense and, I might add this, at this particular day, according to my latest information from granted certiorari Law Week and so on."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,503.922,518.52,"There are cases, are there not? There'd been a number of them-- of witnesses in a civil action, either parties or independent witnesses, refusing on Fifth Amendment grounds to respond to questions."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,518.52,533.314,"Your Honor, the simple remedy for that and the remedy that was presented by this case and really becomes the funny feature of this case is that, of course, the state district judge has the right."
1974.73-689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,609.161,617.068,"In your argument, you wouldn't-- wouldn't your argument be the same despite the fact that, as you say you brief the merits of this question--"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,617.068,617.941,You want to know if it was going to be the same.
1974.73-689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.941,626.997,"Your argument would be the same, wouldn't it, if the advice had turned out to be or even if your opinion was clearly erroneous advice, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,626.997,628.885,"Erroneous, yes."
1974.73-689,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,630.988,633.947,"Assuming it was in good faith and, as you say, non-contumacious advice."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,633.947,639.221,I think I'm entitled to make mistakes in my practice of law without going to jail.
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.423,695.495,"What should've-- what should a judge do in a civil proceeding when a witness takes the Fifth Amendment and says he won't answer the question and the judge considers it and says “well, this just happens to be within the area that the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to and I direct you to answer the question.”"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,695.495,696.425,You have--
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.425,698.047,And the witness says “I'm awfully sorry.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,699.905,709.587,"That's exactly what the-- put the man in jail for contempt of Court and then, in Texas, we would have a right to litigate the legality of the confinement and the--"
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.587,715.948,"Well, what about the lawyer who says “now, you go ahead and refuse to answer”?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,715.948,718.855,"Sir, my light is on but let me say this."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,730.67,733.005,You can enlarge on that answer after lunch if you want.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,733.005,743.893,"If I may, Your Honor--[Luncheon Break]"
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,743.893,745.446,"Mr. Walsh, you may continue."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,748.173,750.264,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.106,825.291,"Let me ask you, was the judge-- if the judge rules that the Fifth Amendment privilege is not available in a certain context which is being claimed by a party or a witness and insists that a subpoena be complied with or an answer be given to a question and the lawyer advices the client not to answer, do you suggest that he-- that the lawyer-- neither the lawyer nor the client is in contempt of Court?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,825.291,827.513,"No, I didn't suggest that the client was not."
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.513,829.336,"Alright, the client's in contempt of Court."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,829.336,833.847,This Court has decided that very question in Ryan versus United States in the fall of the second--
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.847,836.324,"And-- but, the lawyer is not."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,836.324,844.265,"No, I think the lawyer has the right to give free and untrammeled advice under any circumstances as long as it's an honest professional--"
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.265,856.342,Let's suppose that the client at that very moment had the right to challenge the judge's ruling or appeal.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,858.647,858.864,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.864,861.915,And he chooses not to appeal but disobeys.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,864.006,872.35,"Your Honor, I would be making a quite different argument if that were the case but, under the Texas Law as it applies to this particular case, there was no way to do that."
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.35,880.731,"So that, the only way to test the judge's ruling was to be in contempt and then have the challenge under the Fifth Amendment ruled on as part of the contempt procedure."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,880.731,882.033,"That is correct, sir, but--"
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,882.033,884.716,And you either get a stay of that or habeas corpus.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,884.716,896.02,"Well, Your Honor, the lawyers attempted to obtain habeas corpus relief from both the Supreme Court of Texas and the Court of Criminal Appeals, both of which denied relief."
1974.73-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.02,896.404,Is there--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,896.404,908.505,"They then went to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas which granted writ of habeas corpus and, the minute the Federal Court granted the writ, the state judge released the prisoner, thereby, mooting the whole case."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.35,913.309,Did he find him or did he just wash that case out?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,913.309,915.196,He just washed it off.
1974.73-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,915.196,925.321,Was there any dispute between you and your opponents as to whether there was a procedure in Texas to challenge this ruling other than back in here?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,925.321,929.85,"Well, Mr. Zwiener and Mr. Dibrell can answer that, but I don't think there is any such dispute."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,935.632,936.669,Mr. Walsh--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,937.588,939.095,"Well, that's all, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,962.723,978.801,"When you cast it in that form, of course it at least doesn't give me difficulty, but let me suggest a hypothetical case to you, just an ordinary civil lawsuit, personal injury or whatever."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,992.687,993.386,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.386,1005.918,"In argument if it's the defendant, so later decide it's a third-party witness and the third-party witness refuses to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1013.381,1023.674,"Your Honor, I think the Court can hold the witness in contempt and let the witness exercise his right to habeas corpus and the other relief which is available, which is precisely what this Court decided in Ryan."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.674,1025.162,"Now, let's move to his lawyer."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1025.162,1025.731,Sir?
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1025.731,1028.237,"Now, let's move to his lawyer as in this case."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1028.237,1028.656,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1028.656,1039.336,"And the answer of the witness is that, on advice of counsel naming him, he declines to answer for his reasons."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1070.855,1080.798,"Well, frankly, I am not briefed to discuss that but my answer would be, just having briefed the rest of this case, my answer would be yes."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1080.798,1081.058,Must be against--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1081.058,1082.23,Hold the witness in contempt.
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1082.23,1085.226,Just move against the witness and not against the client.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1085.226,1104.478,"I am willing to concede, Your Honor, that there are peculiar circumstances that I can conceive of where the lawyer's advice would be so frivolous that perhaps the Court could take disciplinary action, but I don't think by way of contempt."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1104.478,1104.634,And a later--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1104.634,1108.102,I think the way would be through the grievance procedure or something of that sort.
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.102,1109.915,Take disciplinary action or refer it.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1114.156,1115.358,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1115.358,1120.222,"But, independent of the case and independent of any contempt proceeding."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1120.222,1122.765,"Your Honor, that happens to be my opinion."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.63,1125.886,No.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1125.886,1136.888,"This man was under a criminal accusation at the time and it happened to arise in the context of a civil action, but he was under a pending existing criminal action at the time."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1136.888,1140.024,And the matter sought to be produced was the subject of the criminal procedure.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1140.024,1142.786,"Yes, sir, and was contraband."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.639,1184.158,"Mr. Walsh, supposing that instead of the attorney's objection and advice being based on Fifth Amendment grounds, this came up in the course of a proceeding where his client was on the stand, the client, say, was a defendant in a civil action and he's being crossed-examined."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1212.706,1214.224,"Your Honor, yes."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.282,1251.461,"Well, I thought that--"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1251.461,1253.496,And the client has remedy against the lawyer.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.496,1259.794,I thought your argument was based though on the idea that this was advice about a constitutional claim.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1259.794,1260.205,That's correct.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.205,1260.724,You think it's simply--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1260.724,1261.981,"That's all that's involved in this case, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.981,1270.408,"Well-- but in my example, it's simply a question of whether it's hearsay and whether he's required to answer in the normal course of interrogation of a witness."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1270.408,1270.659,Well--
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.659,1274.296,Wouldn't you draw a rather sharp distinction or is this free and--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1274.296,1278.894,I am drawing a sharp enough distinction so that I am willing to answer your question.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.894,1279.188,"Well, is this--"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1279.188,1281.011,Because it isn't involved in this case.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1281.011,1289.566,"Well, is the free and untrammeled right of a lawyer to give legal advice something that exists in a-- quite apart from the subject on which he's advising?"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1289.566,1290.753,I think so.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.753,1291.506,In a Courtroom he's--
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1291.506,1296.258,"Well, not in-- completely free from the subject on which he is advising."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.187,1307.261,"But, regardless of whether the subject he's advising on is a constitutional right or not, you feel that in a Courtroom the lawyer has a right to give free and untrammeled legal advice."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1307.261,1307.952,I do.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.952,1311.394,And what's the source in the constitution for that claim?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1311.394,1313.513,The constitutional right to counsel.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.513,1313.818,"But, you don't have the right to--"
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1313.818,1318.779,"It is the constitutional right, for instance, to a jury trial and anything above it more than $20."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.779,1319.057,But that's in a criminal case.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1319.057,1322.124,That involves the constitutional right to have counsel represent you.
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.124,1327.089,Well-- but that's a Seventh Amendment right that the con-- it's conferred on litigants in Federal Courts.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1328.562,1338.275,"Well, I would be prepared to contend that the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses the right to trial back to the right to assistance of counsel in Civil Courts."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.188,1361.849,There's nothing the judge can do.
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1361.849,1363.412,"Yes, he can put the client in jail."
1974.73-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.412,1365.731,Nothing the judge can do to the lawyer?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1365.731,1394.412,"Well, I have seen one case in my own home federal district where the lawyer's asserted a claim of privileges to a communication that was made to them by the clients and Judge Connelly took the position “fine, I can hold you in contempt of Court if you don't answer the question,” and he said “if you're right, you can revert,” but you understand this is the lawyer directly claiming a privilege of his own."
1974.73-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1420.854,1431.76,"Your position would be the same if there's an injunction outstanding against the party and the lawyer advised him not to, he thought the injunction was invalid, and he just advised him to disobey it."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1431.76,1436.205,"Well, Your Honor, I would hope that I would advise him to appeal the injunction."
1974.73-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1436.205,1438.1,"I know, but if you didn't."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1440.416,1447.125,"It-- Your Honor, if there was judicial relief available, it would be a different kettle of fish."
1974.73-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1447.125,1448.023,"Well, that's the critical point."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1448.023,1450.332,"But, in this case, there was no judicial relief available."
1974.73-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.332,1453.502,Isn't that a critical point in your entire argument?
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1453.502,1455.594,I think it's an important point.
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1493.645,1496.146,"Very well, Mr. Walsh."
1974.73-689,0,46542,william_f_walsh,,1496.146,1498.19,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.19,1500.238,Mr. Dibrell.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1500.238,1503.135,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1562.766,1569.454,Is there any explanation to why he drop the charges against the party and didn't drop them against the lawyer?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1569.454,1574.037,"The-- McKelva served seven days in jail, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1585.635,1589.77,"Did he sought any-- well, did he give any relief to the lawyer?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1589.77,1609.211,"The course of the relief of the lawyer under Article 1911 (a) of the Texas statutes, Your Honor, Justice Marshall, the-- before the attorney could actually be held in contempt, actually have to pay a fine or serve time in jail when the contempt has been asserted by the judge."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1622.522,1625.876,"But as long as the Federal Court moot, he turned the--."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1625.876,1625.982,"What, sir?"
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1625.982,1628.556,Client loose.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1628.556,1657.692,"That was the-- that was before the writs were denied, from my understanding that that developed before the writs were denied by the Supreme Court of Texas or the Court of Criminal Appeals with reference to the, not to McKelva but, with reference to the Dis-- the contempt, actually the lawyer is, as far as making a file, a determination occurred long after the mootness of the McKelva content."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1657.692,1659.233,It did?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1659.233,1668.917,"Yes, Your Honor, because the attorney, you see, not had there, review by Judge Meyers under the Texas procedure where the attorneys--"
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1668.917,1674.254,"I'm not talking-- I'm talking about the judge, the original trial judge."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1684.633,1689.109,"I think under 1911 (a), once he'd made the decision, Your Honor, he no longer had the decision--"
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1689.109,1689.769,Well--
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1689.769,1690.165,To do it.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.842,1725.786,"Well, my other question is when the witness in Texas pleads to Fifth Amendment, did they use the jargon most states use that “on the advice of counsel, I claim the Fifth Amendment”?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1728.503,1729.997,"They have on occasions, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.902,1731.793,But they have on occasion?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1731.793,1732.836,"Yes, they have on occasion."
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.376,1748.761,Did McKelva go up through the-- try to get a review of his contempt conviction in the-- through the state system?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1748.761,1751.359,He had to make an application to the state before.
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1772.963,1777.412,"So he did not get a review because he was released before there was an opportunity for it, is that right?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1777.412,1780.461,"That's right, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.461,1780.603,And it was--
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.603,1787.853,"Was there a motion to-- there was a subpoena issued for magazines and then there was a motion to quash, was there not?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1787.853,1788.985,"There was a motion to quash, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.985,1791.361,And that was what was argued before the judge?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1791.361,1793.581,The argument-- the motion contained one thing.
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.818,1797.277,But it was also--
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1797.277,1798.44,With no property interest.
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.44,1799.619,"It also asserted Fifth Amendment, didn't they?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1799.619,1800.815,"And, it also asserted the Fifth Amendment."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.815,1802.007,The judge overruled the motion.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1802.007,1802.96,"He overruled, yes."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.96,1808.723,"Now, under Texas procedure, could that motion have-- could that decision have been appealed?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1808.723,1809.883,"No, not at that point."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.017,1821.589,So there was no remedy at that point to protect the materials claimed to be protected by the Fifth Amendment except not produce them and argued out in contempt?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1821.589,1825.807,"I think that the remedy course, had we want to get it, and my principal argument to Mr.--"
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.807,1827.109,"Well, is that right or not?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1827.109,1827.599,"What, sir?"
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.599,1830.091,Is that right or not?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1833.216,1837.095,"Well, perhaps there might-- I'm not sure."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.949,1849.636,But the motion denied the denial.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1852.151,1853.074,Not at that point.
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.285,1863.013,And you don't know whether or not--
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1863.013,1865.769,And he had not yet held them in contempt yet either-- at that point either.
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.769,1868.45,And you don't know whether or not mandamus was available.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1868.45,1872.23,"No, I do not."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.79,1957.299,"Well, what if that order had been directed, as I think as Mr. Justice White suggested, to a question subpoenaed to the witness while he was on the stand in the course of trial and he declined to answer on the ground the response might tend to incriminate him."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1962.191,1981.559,"No, Your Honor, not until such time as the judge specifically says “you go ahead and answer the question and then, if the lawyer persists in telling it, I think at that point it's the witness' determination to make that determination whether he wants to be held in contempt, go ahead and suffer the consequences for being held in contempt or--"
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.559,1982.699,Isn't that the normal?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,1993.605,1996.358,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.955,2030.975,"Well, how far will you carry that, Mr. Dibrell?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2066.181,2070.723,"I think he would, yes, Your Honor, I think, if I understand your question right."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2070.723,2083.784,"I'm speaking of before he ever takes the stand, he consults an attorney and the attorney tells him “no, if you're asked to produce it, you just say that on advice of counsel you're not producing it but pleading privilege against self-incrimination.”"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2083.784,2085.377,"No, at that point, I don't think so."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2085.377,2086.406,"Not at that point, alright."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2098.609,2099.66,That is not the facts of this case.
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2099.66,2103.902,"I know it's not, but I'm asking, would the lawyer be in the same difficulty that Mr. Maness is?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2103.902,2104.68,"No, I do not think so."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2104.68,2106.963,"Well, then why is Mr. Maness in the difficulty he's in?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2106.963,2120.738,"I think because if he-- the feeling of the frustration upon the part of trial judge in this proceeding where, first of all, he denied the motion to quash the subpoena then he asked counsel if he want."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2149.673,2152.391,And the lawyer persisted in the advice he'd initially given.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2152.391,2154.125,"That's right, persisted in it."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.125,2154.31,Is the lawyer--
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2154.31,2160.7,It's his second persistence in it that we-- that the respondent feels was contemptible on the part of counsel.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.7,2165.681,Is the lawyer frustrating the judge or the Fifth Amendment frustrating him?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2165.681,2170.103,I don't think the Fifth Amendment was frustrating the course of the facts of this case.
1974.73-689,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2189.157,2193.967,I thought possession would be the crime in Texas?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2193.967,2202.159,"This is still a civil proceeding, Justice Douglas, in the sense that we're trying just to see whether it's about the injunction is, not one with any further problems."
1974.73-689,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2202.159,2213.197,"That's nothing to do with the Fifth Amendment but, I mean, even though it's a civil proceeding he could-- if possession was a crime, he would be protected, wouldn't he?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2213.197,2227.097,"I think that, as Justice Black has indicated in Adams versus Maryland, the fact that he will still be able to be very asserting of the Fifth Amendment privilege would give immunity to what, actually at that point, flow from it."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.646,2240.087,You mean that could be subject to a motion to suppress?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2240.087,2240.631,Yes.
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2240.631,2240.76,For his possession?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2240.76,2243.763,He could still have his motion to suppress the evidence later on.
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.763,2247.882,On the grounds that he was compelled to produce it against his will.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2247.882,2248.378,Yes.
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2248.378,2251.739,Do you think that's enough protection?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2251.739,2272.266,"I think that what this Court really needs to help to decide this is to keep the balance of what the right of the people and a right of the Court to ultimately have all of the facts brought forth any proceeding, civil proceeding and criminal proceeding, obviously Fifth Amendment privileges, other constitutional rights."
1974.73-689,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2305.348,2311.673,"Mr. Dibrell, let me see if your position is what I think it is."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2340.469,2341.231,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2341.231,2349.952,"And that, I take it, you feel is different than to persist in advising the client to take the Fifth."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2349.952,2350.468,I think so.
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2378.475,2380.371,The Court could be wrong.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2380.371,2380.685,Yes.
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2380.685,2383.875,"Practicing lawyers, we've all known instances certainly where we think they're wrong."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2383.875,2394.466,"That's right, yes, Your Honor, and I think that what we need is to cut down as much as possible there up on the part of the trial judge."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.466,2403.387,"Well, what if the client said-- is told to produce this second time, as you say, and he says “may I talk to my attorney?”"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2424.153,2425.36,It's a suggestion that I would make the--
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.36,2430.302,"Not-- the only way you can test it out is to refuse to produce, but we can test it out that way.”"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2430.302,2431.129,I wouldn't argue--
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.129,2436.165,"Is there anything-- that would be a rather normal conversation, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2436.165,2468.64,"If I can get-- I think that your question is the one point, I hope, Justice White, in that what is needed I think, as far as the trial judge is concerned, recognizing that, there, the protectors of the rights of the witnesses and all authorities, at least to have it in camera examination of documents which have been subpoenaed to make a better det-- more determination and, perhaps, would even urge that some in-chamber inquiry up to the point is to what the testimony--"
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2468.64,2470.924,"Tell me this, Mr. Dibrell."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2503.312,2505.182,You're talking about an involuntary surrender.
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.182,2506.708,"Certainly, that's what I'm talking about."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2506.708,2506.72,"Yes, I think--"
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2506.72,2507.231,In response to the order.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2507.231,2509.564,"I think you can, at that time, move to suppress it."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2509.564,2515.388,Is it established law that you could suppress in those circumstances in Texas?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2515.388,2521.145,"Well, I think Texas is under the same ruling as this Court as any other State Courts."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2527.413,2547.476,"But we find that, sometimes, some of these things are not always followed in the State Court so-- but my question is in Texas, in a State Court proceeding, is it accepted law that the involuntary production would enable him to suppress it as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2547.476,2554.015,"I can't cite a case, Your Honor, but I would-- my-- probably, yes, it would be--"
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.015,2568.487,"It isn't perhaps quite enough for the man to know that, ultimately, in the Federal Court he might be vindicated if, in fact, it would be incriminating to him or tend to be incriminating in the State Court system."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2569.828,2579.518,"I don't think it even-- frankly, I don't think that the State Courts have had the point to where he would-- I don't think that there's a saying which say that he would have this risk anymore than with the federal system."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2579.518,2586.735,"But then, doesn't that tender give some color of validity to the lawyer's advice?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2600.761,2609.073,"I think that, frankly, that the State Court would sustain a motion to suppress, but I cannot cite you to a case."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2609.073,2624.869,"Well, what if the lawyer had said to the client exactly what you've just said to the Court that “I think,” if the client in-- during a recess then asked him the question and he said “I think that I can't cite any case that it will be subject to motion to suppress”?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2624.869,2625.934,"Well, I think we ought to hold that."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.617,2645.55,"But, Mr. Dibrell, on your-- you said the only way to try it out is to go to jail."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2645.55,2651.984,"This is what Mr. Walsh indicated, let the-- let his client go to jail."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2651.984,2671.214,"Well, if that's the only way to do it and you say that's the one we are trying it out, and the judge puts both the lawyer and the client in jail, how do you get a trial while they're in jail, both of them?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2671.214,2675.537,"Of course, in this case, the judge didn't put them both in jail until he-- you don't get the trial."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.537,2678.502,"Well, you said he couldn't put them there."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2678.502,2679.092,"What, sir?"
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2679.092,2681.73,"Could he have given them 10 days, the lawyer?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2681.73,2685.139,"He gave them 10 days, but he could not then put the lawyer in jail."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.139,2685.355,Why not?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2685.355,2687.982,Because another judge has to come in and hear the matter.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2687.982,2689.157,Why not?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2689.157,2701.339,"Because Article 1911 (a) of the Texas statute provides that an officer of the Court or the attorney who is held in contempt by a judge, that judge must let another judge come in and preside over the matter."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2701.339,2705.138,"Well, then he say-- that judge says “go to jail.”"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2709.815,2713.024,"Well, he doesn't litigate it by a writ of habeas corpus."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.024,2715.968,In jail?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2715.968,2725.728,"Well, he would be broth forth to be litigated in Court."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2725.728,2741.013,"Well, what's left of the Fifth Amendment in a civil proceeding in Texas, other than the judge's unfettered discretion?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2741.013,2751.555,I don't think it's anymore unfettered discretion than any judge in the trial of any proceedings that he's got to consciously follow the-- what he understand what action of the law is.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.166,2763.521,But this is the Fifth Amendment we're talking about.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2763.521,2764.925,"Yes, and the Fifth Amendment."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.925,2766.623,To the constitution?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2766.623,2777.599,"I think that he has either gone to sus-- when the privilege is raised, he's either got the option of either-- obviously, he's got the option of either sustaining the assertion of the--"
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.599,2790.875,"Do you recognize that the lawyer might have been wrong in the Fifth Amendment advice he gave and, if you assume that he could be wrong, would you also assume that the judge could be wrong?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2790.875,2791.462,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.978,2800.729,But 10 days will settle that in jail?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2810.472,2811.64,He returns the--
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.64,2811.973,Materials.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.973,2814.906,Materials loose.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2814.906,2819.255,"I think he still has available to a motion to suppress the evidence even in this proceeding, this current proceeding--"
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2819.255,2822.209,Of course he has a right to file a motion.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2824.069,2825.357,And also to object to it.
1974.73-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.55,2832.864,Can you give me one case in Texas that's granted a motion to suppress?
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2835.318,2838.425,A case to suppress evidence?
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.425,2839.597,In these circumstances.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2839.597,2840.642,In these circumstances.
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.441,2845.313,"Well, I gather the trial judge indicated that it would be."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2869.818,2873.183,"Well, at least Judge Clauson was taking this attitude."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.183,2873.456,Yes.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2873.456,2874.695,"Yes, I think."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2874.695,2878.338,"Well, he's saying that it would be reached."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2883.003,2889.144,I think of it as an assurance by this Court and this proceeding that it could be reached by that being considered.
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2889.144,2890.789,"But it wasn't the trial judge, was it?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2897.226,2898.333,"Now, that's the trial judge."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2898.333,2906.833,This is the trial judge.
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.955,2920.412,"Judge Clauson, if you'll look at the bottom of page 8, I think it begins with Judge Clauson and then carries on through pages 9, 10, and 11."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2920.412,2925.75,"Yes, it's Judge Clauson."
1974.73-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.75,2943.202,"Mr. Dibrell, what is the normal Texas procedure when someone is found in contempt during the course of a trial for that person who is himself found in contempt to obtain-- until appellate review in the state system?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2943.202,2948.04,"By a writ of habeas corpus to the State Court, State Appellate Court."
1974.73-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2948.04,2963.129,"And, was McKelva the client or witness here, was he in a position to seek habeas corpus had he gone to jail to-- or had he been sentenced for contempt by Judge Clauson?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2963.129,2969.772,He was sentenced for criminal contempt of 10 days and--
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2969.772,2970.685,By Judge Clauson.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2970.685,2972.288,"By Judge Clauson, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2972.288,2974.857,And he sought state habeas corpus.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2974.857,2975.664,State habeas corpus.
1974.73-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2975.664,2976.794,All the way up.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2976.794,2977.514,All the way up.
1974.73-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.514,2982.369,"If the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals or Supreme Court have thought his claim meritorious, they would've--"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2982.369,2983.298,They could've granted.
1974.73-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.298,2984.335,Could've granted.
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.335,2985.026,I misunderstood.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,2995.116,2996.607,He had already made this.
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.06,3000.105,I misunderstood you.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3001.339,3002.605,"Yes, McKelva."
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.142,3010.047,"And, in effect, the judge's ruling sustained that?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3010.047,3010.624,That's right.
1974.73-689,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3010.624,3011.089,Right.
1974.73-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.089,3022.522,"And, so that if he hadn't been-- if he had turned the magazines over, he could never have had that review because he never would've been held in contempt."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3022.522,3025.772,"He would n-- that's right, he would not been held in contempt."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.824,3030.656,Let me go back.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3030.656,3030.872,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3030.872,3039.652,"I'm sorry to track over it again, but this judge's statement at page 11 of your brief."
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3039.652,3040.85,"Of the petitioner's brief, Your Honor?"
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3040.85,3065.14,"Yes, right near at the top of the page where the Court said “referring to the action, the compulsory production, that it could have been reached by a motion to suppress that evidence or by an objection to an attempt to introduce it.”"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3088.702,3090.276,"I think more, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.032,3172.092,"Well, what's the scope of the Fifth Amendment Incrimination Clause?"
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3187.193,3189.768,"Well, I think this Court has already determines that it is very personal."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3212.915,3215.055,But that doesn't quite answer my question.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3235.422,3237.535,"No, I don't think you have to show that you are bound to be convicted."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3251.885,3254.464,Assume-- let's alter our facts a little.
1974.73-689,1,30064,joe_b_dibrell,,3275.898,3282.687,"I don't see the distinction there, but what are the possible some criminal prosecution pending or civil."
1974.73-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.78,3297.325,"Very well, Mr. Dibrell."
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3299.625,3300.32,"Very little, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3354.787,3355.775,Of which?
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3355.775,3367.945,"Of the appendix, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas simply denied the motion for relief to file the application for habeas corpus as to McKelva."
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3375.133,3377.88,And did all of that happen within seven days or--
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3377.88,3383.315,"Yes, they moved fast, Your Honor, and did everything they could for their client."
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3414.183,3415.851,"And this was a criminal contempt, wasn't it?"
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3418.466,3420.6,"Well, he was in contempt of Court, Your Honor."
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3421.29,3422.42,"Well, it was a 10-day certain."
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3422.42,3425.265,"Yes, and that was what was given the lawyers too."
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3425.265,3426.136,And the lawyers also had the number of days certain post to fine.
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3426.136,3447.358,"The reviewing judge-- as Mr. Dibrell has said, the reviewing judge changed the jail sentences to the lawyer as to both Mr. Maley and Mr. Maness to a $500-fine but, of course, on non-payment of the fine they're subject to going to jail."
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3469.754,3472.031,"Well, I saw Judge Craig's opinion and where is--"
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3472.031,3473.424,"No, Judge Roberts, Your Honor."

1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3474.652,3475.272,Yes.
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3475.272,3476.15,On the habeas.
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3476.15,3477.689,"It's, I believe, Exhibit C."
1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3477.689,3477.923,Yes.

1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.734,3481.61,Right.

1974.73-689,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3483.488,3483.779,Right.
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3483.779,3487.49,And--
1974.73-689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.49,3498.582,Isn't there a normal procedure in Texas for granting immunity where the state wants testimony that explain in the--
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3498.582,3504.573,"Your Honor, we have several independent statutes on immunity in various kinds of cases."
1974.73-689,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.573,3512.913,"Normally, the prosecutor or the judge or somebody has to make it clear to the witness or the party that that removes the danger."
1974.73-689,2,46542,william_f_walsh,,3512.913,3528.046,"Well, yes and, furthermore, I might point out that the idea that Mr. Dibrell suggested to the Court I have crow with it."
1974.73-689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3588.73,3589.566,"Very well, Mr. Walsh."
