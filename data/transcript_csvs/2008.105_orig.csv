2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.589,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 105 on our original docket, Kansas v. Colorado."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,8.9,29.297,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article III makes a clear distinction between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction, and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress is not granted the same power over original jurisdiction."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,29.297,32.861,That's an extremely sensitive clause in Article III.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,37.467,47.512,"Well, I think can you, and the Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and avoid that constitutional conflict."
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.451,114.324,"But, on the other hand, ""court of the United States"" is defined specifically to include the Supreme Court."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,133.551,135.739,You don't have to pick.
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,160.508,161.526,What about--
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,161.526,161.931,And that--
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,161.931,162.977,"--It also says ""clerk""."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,165.913,175.518,"--You do, and 28 U.S.C. section 1911, another provision in title 28, specifically deals with the Supreme Court Clerk."
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.83,188.952,"Is 1911 a stand-alone provision that would justify relief for you, or do we have to also refer to the general cost statute?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,188.952,197.792,I don't think the Court would refer to the general cost statute in its original jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from Congress.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.761,209.366,"Well, but let's assume that we think Congress can control this -- this issue, this question."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,217.722,232.011,"--I mean, I would -- if your assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant of the discretion the Court already has."
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.699,242.398,"If I think this case is controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,242.398,243.74,No.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.13,248.926,Why can't you rest your case just on 1911?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,248.926,259.377,"Because in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given power to make exceptions or regulations over original jurisdiction."
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.061,273.462,"Are you saying that 1911 doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not included within the term ""other necessary disbursements""?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,273.462,280.259,--I believe the expert witness fees in this case were vital to the resolution.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.055,283.211,Were they within 1911?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,283.211,285.975,--I don't believe they were other incidental disbursements.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.036,288.74,Other necessary disbursements.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,288.74,289.941,Other necessary disbursements.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,289.941,290.799,Incidental to the case.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,292.706,306.467,"If -- if this Court determines that Congress has the power, and it's done so through -- since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I certainly would accept that position as the result."
2008.105_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,313.152,320.865,"If your reading of the statute is correct, then I take it we would have the discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert fees."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,321.633,322.864,"Absolutely, and--"
2008.105_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,322.864,339.422,"And if that were -- if that's so, why shouldn't we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert fees that are available in a case in the original jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the expert fees that would be available in a district court?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,353.449,358.397,"--Clearly, the Court has the power to make that rule for original cases."
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.918,390.62,"Well, but Justice Alito is saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have guidance from Congress."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,403.331,414.765,"Because what Colorado's position is, is they are telling you that the Special Master's hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even exercise that discretion in a bright-line rule that would say $40 a day."
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.765,423.227,"We are saying it's our discretion, and our discretion is guided by what Congress has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and so forth."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,423.227,426.745,"Clearly, the Court would have the power to do that."
2008.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.724,450.859,"In all those -- in all those cases has the Special Master ever called a court witness, that is a court expert, appointed a court expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a witness?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,467.117,468.852,--I can tell you it didn't happen in this case.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.814,523.487,How do we -- how do Special Master fees work?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,529.874,530.296,Sure.
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.585,551.49,"Well, what if they hadn't -- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,551.49,553.287,--If they hasn't resolved the Special Master's--
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,553.287,553.584,Yes.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,562.501,571.388,"--Well, I think the authority of the Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master to handle the case and to do the specific things that were--"
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.388,571.685,Okay.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,576.275,578.681,--To appoint a Special Master?
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.681,579.196,Yes.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,579.196,583.118,It's an inherent authority the Court has in original jurisdiction cases.
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.118,585.509,So that the authority to compensate is inherent?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,585.509,587.787,The authority to compensate is inherent.
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.241,592.645,Are you making -- would you make an inherent authority argument here?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,592.645,594.365,--Yes.
2008.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.739,606.906,"Regardless of original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say that this Court simply has the inherent authority to -- to -- in effect to decree these sorts of things?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,606.906,611.09,"--Well, again there is a distinction between appellate and original."
2008.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.52,639.174,"General Six, under your reading of the statute, 1911 particularly, would the Court have authority to charge your fees to your adversary, shift attorney's fees?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,639.174,639.907,Yes.
2008.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.06,646.31,Did you make such a request in this case?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,653.84,659.354,--The Special Master should have the discretion to consider all the costs and the unique circumstances of the case.
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.881,662.587,We should have the discretion.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,671.486,681.09,"--It is, and the benefit of having the Special Master make a recommendation is we could have gone through these different categories of costs and come up with a recommendation."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,682.841,691.946,I take it the usual practice is for the parties to settle this matter and submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that correct?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,691.946,697.476,"--The way it's worked in this case is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the Special Master's fees."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,710.703,713.574,So why didn't -- then why are we here?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,730.474,732.583,"Well, the Special Master's fees we resolved."
2008.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.576,750.495,Would you just answer my question of a moment ago?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,754.431,766.349,"--Well, in this case they should be treated differently because the model at issue that the experts for Kansas developed, the H-I model, was used to prove our claims at trial, which would have--"
2008.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.349,767.847,"You used lawyers to prove your case, too."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,767.847,768.24,--Excuse me?
2008.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.24,770.564,"You used lawyers to prove your case, too."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,772.939,775.72,Because we considered the special circumstances of the model.
2008.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.883,804.053,I don't understand that to be an answer to why you didn't also ask for attorney's fees.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,804.053,814.547,"Well, in a particular case where perhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed or some other situation developed, fee shifting may be appropriate."
2008.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.027,825.684,Do you know whether any other--
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,825.684,825.918,So that was the distinction.
2008.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.918,846.145,"--You didn't know, in answer to my last question, what the practice had been, but with respect to expert fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court ever deviated from the $40 or, when it was $30, $30?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,846.145,852.906,In original cases the Court has never referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutes discussed in Crawford Fitting.
2008.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,852.906,866.372,But have they ever approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for the expert witness that deviates from the $40?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,866.372,878.382,"I think the answer to that is yes and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v. New York in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the Delaware River."
2008.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,899.451,904.965,Do you know -- do you know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,904.965,910.869,--It does not say in the published opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is.
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.994,945.59,You're right.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,992.883,997.567,Because in the original cases the Court has always tried to reach an equitable balance--
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,997.567,1009.186,"Have you any example where Congress had a statute which says every court in the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that number is; it's $382.50, okay."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1016.046,1018.23,--I'm not aware of that--
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.23,1018.998,Okay.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1055.81,1059.026,--I would suggest the only difference is the parties.
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.604,1066.261,"If anything, the parties are in a better position to pay the money than the average person."
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.261,1079.815,"Well, I assume -- I assume your answer is that -- that it's our business, and we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert Einstein is ridiculous."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1084.611,1085.953,--That's exactly my answer.
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.359,1092.152,"--Well, I'm not sure that answer is -- is at all adequate."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1137.788,1155.312,"--The difference is the Court has indicated for original cases: These are such disputes of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations that the model case for even taking a case is where the acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type of thing that would lead to war."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1156.467,1160.248,"I haven't seen -- I mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does it?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1177.224,1178.207,--I would agree.
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.168,1201.416,"It's not unfair to have a rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or lose."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1202.851,1206.022,--I don't think that's the rule in original jurisdiction cases.
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.022,1206.786,Why?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1206.786,1207.335,At least the Court has never said that.
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.912,1222.28,"If you lose this case, if we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his own experts."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1223.219,1225.546,"--I think that's correct, but we didn't lose."
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.416,1233.934,"Well, can we do this then?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1242.836,1246.584,--The Court would have that ability to do that in original jurisdiction--
2008.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.584,1247.145,"Well, should we do that, too?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1252.769,1261.844,"--Because in the original jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and historically awarded the prevailing party costs."
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.461,1279.227,Could it say that for the lower courts?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1289.768,1291.69,"Yes, it could say that for the lower courts."
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.69,1292.158,Why?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1292.158,1293.285,Because--
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.285,1304.294,"You think that, so long as Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any sort of absurd rules?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1304.294,1315.305,"--I think they could pass a rule like they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for Special Masters, and they could through the Rules Enabling Act pass a rule that says you can't use Special Masters."
2008.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.118,1330.439,"I -- I just don't agree with your assumption that just because Congress need not have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal court required by the Constitution is this Court, therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever it wants with them."
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1331.66,1341.109,"--Well, I would certainly focus more on the original jurisdiction issue here and haven't focused as much on that issue, but--"
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1341.109,1348.494,"When we award the -- the Special Master's fees in original cases, do we specify who will bear those fees?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1348.494,1349.683,"--Yes, you do."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1362.52,1367.095,Do we include the Special Master's fees as part of the costs that are allocated?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1367.095,1370.876,"Yes, and in this case the parties have agreed to that and never made an issue about that."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1371.391,1374.25,"Well, why -- why did the parties agree to it if we do it?"
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1381.605,1383.855,"--Well, in this case -- maybe I misheard your question."
2008.105_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1387.961,1388.573,Right.
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1388.573,1391.525,And the parties did not agree to that ahead of time.
2008.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1395.6,1399.301,Isn't it -- isn't it customary for it to be divided 50/50?
2008.105_orig,0,26043,gen_steve_six,,1413.265,1417.73,"Well, as the case progressed, the Special Master submitted bills that were divided 50/50."
2008.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1439.906,1442.562,"Of course, I think you gave the answer earlier."

2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,2829.625,2832.046,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.105_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.324,2845.243,Maybe lawyers get even more.
2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,2847.083,2847.395,--That's right.
2008.105_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.988,2851.787,May I just get clear on your view of inherent power?
2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,2885.284,2902.293,"That's correct, Justice Souter, to the extent that there was nothing applicable to this and it came before you, should expert witnesses get compensated some -- some amount, Congress hasn't spoken on it, I would think, as a matter of default, you could say yes."
2008.105_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2904.777,2912.822,"Do you think there is -- there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court -- just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could not eliminate?"
2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,2925.473,2933.813,"--No, Justice Souter, it would not be because then it's interfering with your ability to do what courts do as a central matter."
2008.105_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2934.234,2936.761,Isn't that a pretty slippery slope then that you're on?
2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,2963.952,2968.311,"--Justice Souter, it's not telling you how to decide cases."
2008.105_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.543,2989.741,--What if Congress -- really you think Congress could set any -- there's not some point at which it is so destructive of the process here?
2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,3001.828,3015.965,"It's -- I think the question would be, Justice Scalia, is that a fundamental interference with the Court's ability to decide cases?"
2008.105_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3020.027,3025.273,"But that would be a matter of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take it."
2008.105_orig,1,26080,gen_john_w_suthers,,3025.273,3027.148,I believe that's correct.
2008.105_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3067.352,3070.113,"Thank you, General."
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3072.785,3080.344,1920 didn't appear in 1948 magically.
2008.105_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3145.958,3147.923,"But the Constitution uses the word ""judge""."
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3158.42,3168.617,"--And certainly Congress isn't tied to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to refer to any of you as ""judges""."
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3213.399,3213.773,I'm sorry.
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3228.269,3229.969,--In 1948.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3229.969,3230.983,In '48?
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3230.983,3231.423,Yes.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3231.423,3234.189,So the inclusion wasn't there till then.
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3249.992,3250.788,"No, there isn't."
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3251.536,3251.868,Nothing?
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3251.868,3252.258,--They changed--
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3252.258,3254.021,"So, in other words, the language"
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3266.406,3268.313,--Yes.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3268.313,3269.924,They do appear before?
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3269.924,3270.704,No.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3270.704,3271.733,"No, they do not."
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3271.733,3272.486,First time in 1948.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3272.486,3273.531,First time in 1948.
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3276.435,3278.214,Yes.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3278.214,3283.493,And there is no indication the revisor intended to change the meaning that pre-existed.
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3283.493,3284.164,Yes.
2008.105_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3284.164,3285.119,Okay.
2008.105_orig,2,26043,gen_steve_six,,3286.601,3287.572,And they did change something else.
