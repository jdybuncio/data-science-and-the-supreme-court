1975.74-775,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.217,"We will hear arguments next in 74-775, New Orleans against Nancy Dukes."
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,64.203,68.085,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-775,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.296,230.007,"Mr. Loeffelholz, will all that really is involved on this jurisdictional place whether you should come here by appeal or by certiorari?"
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,230.007,240.118,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and we would also submit that the City of El Paso case would allow you to treat this matter as a matter on certiorari as well."
1975.74-775,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,399.486,405.967,I take it you feel Morey against Doud has no application here at all.
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,405.967,410.645,"Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I feel that it has application and that it is the guiding principle."
1975.74-775,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,427.436,429.414,But you did not cite it in your brief.
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,429.414,430.488,"I mentioned it, I believe."
1975.74-775,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,431.408,435.423,"Well, you did in your jurisdictional statement, but I do not --"
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,435.423,436.613,I stand corrected.
1975.74-775,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,436.613,438.397,I do not recall this in your brief at all.
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,440.987,459.206,"Well, I feel that as far as the law is concerned it may have application in the area of the equal protection argument, and I feel that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal rightly so looked at those requirements as expressed in Morey versus Doud, but their interpretation of it strongly differs from ours."
1975.74-775,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.445,492.434,Why are we talking about whether or not the state?s interest is compelling when you are simply dealing with ordinary economic legislation?
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,503.695,503.963,Well--
1975.74-775,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,503.963,505.646,"Well, it is the McGowan versus Maryland."
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,505.646,507.558,That is the McGowan test Mr. Chief Justice; that is correct.
1975.74-775,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,507.558,509.619,Is that not that controls here?
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,509.619,511.67,That should control.
1975.74-775,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.379,536.565,And our rationality test did not say the exception in the Illinois statute in Morey and Doud.
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,536.565,537.381,"No, it did not."
1975.74-775,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,537.381,546.307,"And you have gotten out of syllabus, I gather, that even though it did not there, the grandfather clause here is saved by the rationality test, is that it?"
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,546.307,548.486,"Well, that is what it boils down to, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1975.74-775,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.978,584.58,"Well I here you have, I gather, a hotdog vendor, Lucky something of that, was it not?"
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,584.58,585.395,"Lucky Dogs, that is correct."
1975.74-775,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.395,589.967,"Lucky Dogs, and they have been doing business in the French Quarter for eight years or more, is that right?"
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,589.967,590.784,22 years.
1975.74-775,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,590.784,592.204,"Well, over eight years."
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,592.204,593.175,Yes sir.
1975.74-775,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,593.175,601.795,"And this particular appellee has been a competitor of Lucky Dogs for only two years, right?"
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,601.795,602.934,"No, sir, that is not correct."
1975.74-775,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,606.924,609.601,But they have been doing business for about two years.
1975.74-775,0,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,609.601,619.954,"Well, it has been doing business for about two years, but if you would look at Volume 1 of the Appendix, Page 80 and 81, which is all the District Court had before it when it decided and the Fifth Circuit had before it as well."
1975.74-775,1,31973,joseph_neves_marcal_iii,,1437.525,1447.248,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-775,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1622.498,1634.644,"Your brother on the other side has pointed to an affidavit in this record indicating that your client was not in direct competition of Lucky Dogs, that her pushcarts indeed did not sell hotdogs."
1975.74-775,1,31973,joseph_neves_marcal_iii,,1634.644,1641.536,"That is a term of a phrase, Justice Stewart, which I feel is unfortunate."
1975.74-775,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1646.044,1646.924,That is what the record shows.
1975.74-775,1,31973,joseph_neves_marcal_iii,,1646.924,1649.061,But that is what the record shows undoubtedly.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3311.257,3311.5,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3350.857,3353.873,"Just that she was doing confections, was she not?"
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3353.873,3355.119,Confections.
1975.74-775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3379.712,3384.436,Is her case any better or worse whether she did or did not sell hotdogs?
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3384.436,3384.73,I believe --
1975.74-775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3384.73,3385.968,As far as this ordinance is concerned?
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3385.968,3393.871,"I believe, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it may be in this respect, because we maintain that she is not within that protected class that she claim she carries the banner for, a hotdog salesman."
1975.74-775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3393.871,3399.382,"Although she has been eight years, a vendor, whether or not she sells hotdogs."
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3399.382,3401.166,"Well, it depends."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3452.198,3454.104,And foodstuffs.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3454.104,3457.509,"In her affidavit, she does not say that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3457.509,3459.303,Your statement did say foodstuffs.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3459.303,3470.92,"That is correct because the contention she made to the District Court by her counsel, which I was compelled to answer, was that she wanted to go there and sell."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3484.026,3485.813,May I get to another point?
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3485.813,3486.258,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3486.258,3494.63,"In this protection of the French Quarter, etcetera, whether there are too many of these or you want to get a fewer numbers?"
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3494.63,3503.285,"I believe the overall regulatory scheme shall be, in the future years, to eliminate all transient vendors, street peddlers, and hawkers."
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3509.05,3510.256,There is no restriction at the present time.
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3510.256,3515.718,"So, Lucky Dogs can put out twice as many as were displaced."
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3515.718,3516.804,That is correct.
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3517.884,3527.342,Could Lucky Dogs also put out one that sold the same things that Ms. Duke sold.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3527.342,3529.297,I do not believe they could under the ordinance as it now stands.
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3529.297,3530.35,Why not?
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3530.35,3532.621,"Because, I think, the policy behind the ordinance is clear."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3537.174,3538.293,But it said --
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3538.293,3541.182,"As it is written, you may be correct."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3541.182,3550.391,That is why I do not understand what you are driving at if you give one man unlimited.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3560.019,3560.404,As far as --
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3560.404,3561.944,The answer is yes.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3561.944,3564.362,"Maybe under the ordinance as it stands, but --"
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3564.362,3565.735,"Well, that is what we have before us."
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3565.735,3570.096,"Well, that is correct but we also have to look at the intention of the City Council as well."
1975.74-775,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3581.813,3584.221,But that is why the case is in Court.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3584.221,3592.668,"Well, that may be because the case is in Court and it may not be because they were under no restraint."
1975.74-775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3681.163,3684.736,I take it then you stick on compelling interest.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3684.736,3686.283,I would stress compelling interest.
1975.74-775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3687.624,3690.792,You go that far and you think you have to go that far.
1975.74-775,2,31473,joel_p_loeffelholz,,3690.792,3695.356,"I believe that, in this Court, we must go that far."
1975.74-775,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3696.664,3698.282,The case is submitted.
