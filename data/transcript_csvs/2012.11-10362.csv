2012.11-10362,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.32,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-10362, Millbrook v. United States."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,11.022,13.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-10362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,39.625,43.577,"Would that include, say, a meat -- a meat inspector?"
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,49.564,55.635,"The proviso doesn't any employee of the United States who is authorized to carry out a search, seizure, or arrest."
2012.11-10362,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.016,135.936,"As a general matter, first in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to be a peace officer?"
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,135.936,138.972,The -- yes.
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.097,179.032,That doesn't prove that they're officers.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,199.112,205.599,"I would think in the context of the prison, it's hard to imagine how a prison guard could exercise any more authority than they do."
2012.11-10362,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.782,261.019,"Counsel, you've argued something slightly different than I took from your briefs."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,316.737,327.711,"Justice Sotomayor, let me begin answering that question by making a distinction which I think is an important distinction here, between the definition of status and the definition of the conduct that's implied here."
2012.11-10362,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.66,356.481,"I think they're saying is arrests, search and seizure, and whatever the third was."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,356.481,360.533,"--Or some other similar activities, which, again, I'm not sure addresses the topic--"
2012.11-10362,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.533,361.468,But let's define it more broadly.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,375.876,376.811,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-10362,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,376.811,380.43,Let's assume that we've defined it more broadly.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,383.564,387.166,The problem with their position is -- with the amicus--
2012.11-10362,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,387.166,396.539,"And of -- yes, with amicus's or the government's, meaning, instead of limiting it to criminal activity, limited to law enforcement activities broadly defined."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,396.539,402.961,--The problem with amicus's requirement is that it has no textual basis in the statute.
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.228,407.497,"Well, I will give you -- I'll give you a textual basis."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,487.115,488.567,"Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.567,491.353,The others would not -- would not occur.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,491.353,497.34,--I think that that is a limiting factor that is not just implicit but explicit in the statutory text.
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.34,514.968,"Yes, but it's -- it's a limiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an intent to limit the -- the activities of investigative or law enforcement officers to those activities conducted in the course of investigating or enforcing the law."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,514.968,540.684,"Well, the fact that Congress was so explicit about categorizing precisely the kind of torts that are covered here -- that sort of conduct -- and the fact that Congress was so precise about cross-referencing Section 1346(b), which incorporates of the scope of employment requirement, suggests to me that when Congress wanted to confine the capacity in which the acts occurred, it could do so, and it did in fact do so."
2012.11-10362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.684,541.184,--I understand--
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.184,542.917,Why would it leave out those other ones?
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,550.556,552.742,"That was the policy judgment that Congress made, that it would not--"
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.742,555.225,I -- I didn't deny that it's the judgment.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,557.11,565.549,--That it didn't think that those sorts of torts in this context -- and I think we all agree this is a law enforcement-oriented provision.
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.149,567.865,I give you a reason.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,567.865,568.501,Yes.
2012.11-10362,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.501,576.321,The reason -- the reason they left it out is that they don't think those torts would be committed in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,576.321,586.795,"I think that's right, Your Honor, but that doesn't mean that from that we ought to draw an entirely extra-textual additional limitation that goes beyond the specific line that Congress did, in fact, draw here."
2012.11-10362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.795,590.913,--Your view is that the limitation is scope of employment.
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,590.913,591.663,That's right.
2012.11-10362,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.663,597.15,"The scope of employment is, and you don't add on anything else to that."
2012.11-10362,0,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,615.694,621.448,"First of all, Your Honor, I think that the question of scope of employment was something that was conceded below."
2012.11-10362,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,701.133,701.983,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,711.922,715.041,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-10362,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,751.164,760.503,"What are the kinds of things, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of employment, but would not be acting within a law enforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer?"
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,765.806,773.829,"--Well, this is complicated by the fact that for the Federal Tort Claims Act, scope of employment is a question that turns on State law."
2012.11-10362,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,825.762,842.604,"But you can't give me just a couple of examples of how the difference would matter, you know, in some States, where something would be -- would meet the scope of employment test, but not meet the acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law enforcement officer again."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,842.604,851.71,"--Again, acting as a law enforcement officer test is not something that appears in the statute and it's not something that even amicus has tried to meet the limitations of."
2012.11-10362,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,908.832,914.985,"Mr. Yang, even if -- if -- it depends on State law, that's clear."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,943.153,950.093,"I believe, if I understand your question correctly, the answer is yes, but let me qualify that."
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1047.672,1055.493,"Could you go back and tell me, yet again -- you give a limiting principle, but I'm not sure how it applies."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1065.118,1066.101,It does.
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1066.101,1067.82,And why?
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1079.96,1087.031,"Well, I guess there are two elements to the definition of investigative or law enforcement officer within the statute."
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1116.151,1117.334,--How about Customs agents?
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1117.334,1120.602,--Customs agents?
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1156.259,1161.345,My problem is park employees I think of as officers when you meet them at the parks.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1164.631,1165.816,"Some, some--"
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1165.816,1167.433,Or they may also be giving tours.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1169.518,1171.987,"--Actually, I don't think that is--"
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1171.987,1172.87,--duties.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1172.87,1174.255,"--that's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-10362,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.734,1197.419,"Mr. Yang, the United States didn't take this position below, right?"
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1197.419,1198.388,That is correct.
2012.11-10362,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.388,1199.771,This is a change of heart.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1207.508,1213.079,"Well, this is the Orsay position, which is not the Pooler position I believe the Court is talking about."
2012.11-10362,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.246,1243.031,"So it couldn't be that obvious, I guess?"
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1243.031,1253.572,"--Well, I think in those cases the Government took a position that never was a position that made it to the Solicitor General's office."
2012.11-10362,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.139,1284.858,I think it is true that there is a strong textual argument for your position.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1332.941,1336.81,I guess there is a few parts to that question.
2012.11-10362,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.979,1398.8,"Can you suggest why Congress might have left out libel, slander, misrepresentation?"
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1398.8,1400.033,Yes.
2012.11-10362,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.918,1408.989,Why -- why would they leave that out if they are only looking at the office and not at the function that the person is performing?
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1408.989,1422.916,"--Well, I think that those torts serve as a rough approximation of what Congress anticipated would be the areas where it thought the United States should be liable, when we are talking about Federal law enforcement officers."
2012.11-10362,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.516,1424.283,Right.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1432.187,1437.358,"--Well, not -- I don't know that that is the case, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1542.611,1551.883,"Let's assume we adopted the definition Justice Scalia just proposed, law enforcement officer engaged in law enforcement activities."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1555.835,1560.822,"Well, yes -- maybe yes, maybe no."
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1565.893,1567.11,"Well, you can look at it both ways."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1582.92,1586.372,There could be many answers to that question.
2012.11-10362,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1586.372,1586.923,--Okay.
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1586.923,1599.114,"You could, as the amicus or as the Petitioner suggests, say that the enforcement of a criminal sentence is part of law enforcement capacity, so anything that they do is law enforcement."
2012.11-10362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.641,1617.409,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-10362,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1617.409,1618.259,Thank you.
2012.11-10362,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.259,1624.663,Mr. Bucholtz.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,1624.663,1627.199,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-10362,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1646.077,1657.801,"May I ask, in light of your opening statement, are you then abandoning your position that it must be either arrest, search or seizure?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,1661.253,1683.017,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's not really clear how different the Ninth Circuit and the Third Circuit are from each other, because there haven't been cases that have arisen that have really tested the proposition that the Third Circuit meant only, literally only, the execution of a search, the seizure of evidence, or the making of an arrest, and that would exclude conduct very closely incident to one of those things."
2012.11-10362,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1767.004,1772.158,"Mr. Bucholtz, the statute itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,1793.071,1795.439,"Justice Kagan, I don't think it's a substitution."
2012.11-10362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.224,1852.076,Okay.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,1859.347,1867.834,"Justice Kennedy, in the first sentence of the proviso, the operative provision, Congress referred to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States."
2012.11-10362,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1896.77,1899.988,"But again, it's not just any acts of law enforcement officers."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,1923.02,1927.757,"Congress didn't, in the proviso, Justice Kagan, Congress did not actually use the phrase “ scope of employment ”."
2012.11-10362,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1949.671,1950.621,Is it a limitation?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,1960.962,1966.866,"Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree that -- that the conduct that's covered has to be within the scope of the Federal officer's employment."
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.055,2053.472,What does it leave out?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2061.578,2069.767,"Well, there may be certain types of law enforcement officers, Justice Breyer, who generally aren't engaged in law enforcement activity when they're within the scope of employment."
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.219,2073.802,"Oh, I see."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2073.802,2079.623,"And the reason for that is -- and other types of officers, which hopefully I'll be able to get to, but correctional officers first since that's what this case is about."
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.828,2102.536,"So your idea here is a park policeman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the time, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2109.274,2117.428,"--That's right, because he meets the status-based definition that Congress provided, but there's no reason to think Congress intended that he be covered when he's not engaged in law enforcement activity."
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2117.428,2117.761,I'm sorry.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2153.713,2156.499,Because the correctional officer essentially has two capacities.
2012.11-10362,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.13,2185.432,What about the takedown that occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2215.553,2224.826,"Justice Ginsburg, correctional officers do search prisoners' cells on a routine basis as part of their duty to maintain order and security within the prisons."
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2262.867,2270.605,"Well, what happens -- what happens in the police precinct when police officers are holding pretrial detainees?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2288.899,2297.588,"--Well, as I said before, Justice Sotomayor, I think there are certain types of law enforcement officers who generally when they're acting within the scope of employment are engaged in law enforcement activity."
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.883,2317.685,"Well, why isn't this -- why isn't what the prison guard does law enforcement?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2322.489,2324.489,The law is already--
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.489,2327.005,"He's going to be in prison under these da, da, da, da, da."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2336.713,2344.134,"--Justice Breyer, I think we can tell from the definition in the proviso what Congress was focused on when it -- when it referred to law enforcement officers."
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.252,2348.437,"Well, so now you're saying what those three things could provide the definition?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2348.437,2350.62,--And -- and -- and other conduct that--
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.62,2351.37,And are you saying that?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2351.37,2364.261,"--I used before is yes, with the caveat, and I think it's an important one, that it's not just those three things, only what occurs in the course of those three things the way Pooler could possibly be read, but also conduct that's closely incident to those things."
2012.11-10362,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.261,2372.033,"Well, you don't think the EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces statutes and regulations, do you?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2372.033,2374.651,"It depends, Justice Scalia, it depends--"
2012.11-10362,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.651,2384.757,"Would an officer of the EPA be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to a company saying, You know, you are violating section such-and-such of the statute?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2386.376,2396.982,"--Well, the person who writes the letter may qualify as a law enforcement officer under the definition, but that's a different question, I would submit, than whether that -- whether that act constitutes law enforcement activity."
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.293,2418.661,"Yeah, but EPA is not what I'm thinking of, I don't think they are."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2436.956,2439.658,If it's an FBI agent?
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.658,2443.777,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2450.181,2456.517,"Justice Breyer, the answer -- the answer -- well, it might not be so easy to find an analogy to an ordinary policeman--"
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.517,2456.933,All right.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2470.908,2471.527,--Sure.
2012.11-10362,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.912,2477.328,Okay.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2510.483,2515.268,--Then maybe I should try to return to some of the examples that other Justices have given.
2012.11-10362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2563.934,2566.386,So how does that argument help your case?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2566.386,2575.908,"Because, Justice Kennedy, the point in this case is that we agree that correctional officers fall within the plain language of the definition that Congress provided."
2012.11-10362,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.432,2653.075,"You are saying that the Government is trying to minimize the consequences of coming out its way by providing a definition of the officers covered, which will not hold."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2665.716,2669.352,"Justice Scalia, you have absolutely perfectly encapsulated our position."
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2716.732,2733.46,"One other advantage of your definition is that it takes us out of workplace fights between two employees, because presumably the officers who punch each other out, if that incident occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2735.479,2736.462,"That's part of it, that's right."
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.462,2737.179,All right.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2804.806,2807.825,"Well, two parts to the answer, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-10362,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.61,2966.146,Then scope becomes kind of a surplusage.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,2966.146,2971.383,"Not surpluses necessarily, Justice Ginsburg, because it varies among States."
2012.11-10362,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2984.791,2986.976,It has to be a law enforcement function.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3002.619,3045.431,"Well, if an officer is executing a search but he's doing so because of a personal vendetta against the person whose premises he's searching, and he's -- and he's not -- under whatever the State -- State's law that is applicable, if there is a relatively narrow conception of scope so that you have to be trying to serve your employer, which is the traditional rule, and not just sort of on the job in a loose sense, which is what the D.C. rule has come to be, an officer who is engaged in a search or making -- making an arrest for a completely inappropriate reason, not trying to serve the employer, not in any way that's authorized by the employer, might not be within the scope, but might be engaged in one of the three law enforcement activities that Congress specified."
2012.11-10362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3046.298,3058.922,"A prisoner -- a prisoner is supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the evening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to the cell block."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3060.108,3067.178,"--No, Justice Kennedy, it's not an arrest, for, among other reasons, the reason that prison guards don't have any legal authority to make an arrest in that circumstance."
2012.11-10362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3070.314,3072.416,"Well, he's violating the prison regulations."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3072.416,3073.266,Yes.
2012.11-10362,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3086.841,3090.877,"And that's not a law enforcement function as contemplated by the statute, in your view?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3090.877,3092.495,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3116.277,3124.633,What's the difference between the officer who punches the prisoner to get him on the ground and pick him up?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3138.691,3140.826,"--Justice Sotomayor, the hypothetical is--"
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3140.826,3143.778,Or does some physical injury that's substantial.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3154.253,3157.205,--Are you talking about a Bureau of Prison guard filing the arrest complaint?
2012.11-10362,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3157.205,3157.721,Yes.
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3157.721,3176.749,"Well, I think -- one thing to point out is the government informs the Court in its reply brief that in a situation where there has been a violation of prison rules that may also be a violation of Federal law that may also be a crime, such that, you know, in ordinary English usage, you could refer to the prison guard as conducting an investigation for violation of a Federal crime."
2012.11-10362,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3199.948,3209.971,"Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you have done this already, so I apologize, but could you just state your definition of what it means to be acting as a law enforcement officer?"
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3213.292,3220.028,"Well, Justice Kagan, it's hard to give a simple comprehensive answer that applies to all different types of law enforcement officers."
2012.11-10362,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3232.919,3234.919,But you don't have your own -- so what else gets in the mix?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3237.137,3246.327,"So -- in a case that involves one of those three things but also something else that's incident to or related to those three things, we think it would probably be artificial."
2012.11-10362,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3281.233,3281.95,Maybe?
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3283.285,3290.422,"--Well, I mean, Justice Kagan, in fairness, this case doesn't present that question, because it doesn't involve any law enforcement activity."
2012.11-10362,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3290.422,3295.659,"--But if we're going to adopt your definition, we have to have some understanding of where it's taking us."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3295.659,3296.192,Of course.
2012.11-10362,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3436.602,3437.602,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-10362,2,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3437.602,3440.387,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
2012.11-10362,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.387,3442.672,"Mr. Paolella, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2012.11-10362,3,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,3442.672,3444.472,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-10362,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3475.993,3479.612,"Have they also adopted the government's view of what counts as an officer, or have they not?"
2012.11-10362,3,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,3479.612,3483.664,--I -- I don't think that the issue has really been litigated in the Federal courts.
2012.11-10362,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3515.801,3520.753,"You -- you support the government's position on who's an officer, right?"
2012.11-10362,3,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,3523.689,3531.211,"I think that the word “ officer ” carries some water in this statute, and it means something other than “ employee ”."
2012.11-10362,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3531.211,3532.378,--Is that a yes or a no?
2012.11-10362,3,19852,christopher_j_paolella,,3532.378,3533.128,Yes.
2012.11-10362,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3621.686,3624.186,"Thank you, counsel."
