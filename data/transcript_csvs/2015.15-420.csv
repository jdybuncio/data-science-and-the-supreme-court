2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.315,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-420, United States v. Bryant. Ms. Prelogar."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,7.315,46.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted Section 117 in response to the epidemic of domestic violence in Indian Country. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to strike down the statute as applied to offenders like Respondent who have abused and battered their intimate partners again and again, but whose tribal-court misdemeanor convictions were uncounseled and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment. The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis disconnects the validity of the underlying prior conviction from the permissibility of relying on those convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status if he commits additional criminal conduct."
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.89,169.86,Suppose you had a conviction from a foreign country.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,175.895,179.31,I don't think that there would be any Sixth Amendment problem if Congress chose --
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.31,181.07,Would there be a due process problem?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,181.07,185.49,"I think it -- I think that it would raise a more serious due process issue, but I think that there are --"
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.49,186.89,Why more serious --
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,186.89,187.84,Because --
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.84,189.015,-- in England?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,189.015,198.92,"Well, I think that it would be incumbent on a defendant in that situation to try to come forward and make a showing that that foreign conviction was obtained in a proceeding that wasn't fundamentally fair."
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.91,206.15,Could that showing be attempted in a case like this?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,206.15,213.775,In a Section 117 prosecution? So that raises the question whether there should be a right to have a collateral challenge to a particular conviction.
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,213.775,221.09,"I -- are foreign judgments -- are foreign convictions -- I thought it had to be a Federal, State or a tribal court."
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.09,223.75,I'm assuming the statute was amended.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,223.75,224.58,That's correct.
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.82,257.89,"Well, it's certainly rendered outside the Constitution."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,257.89,266.66,"It's true that the Constitution doesn't govern tribal court proceedings, but Congress has plenary authority, and those proceedings are governed by Federal law through the Indian Civil Rights Act."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.66,271.455,So this case would come out differently if Congress had not enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,271.455,282.1,"I think that if Congress hadn't enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, it's possible that it wouldn't have made tribal court convictions predicates because it wouldn't have the same confidence that there's a baseline level of procedural fairness."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,282.1,290.3,"Well, what if they -- what if they had? In other words, convictions in a tribal court do count as predicates, and there is no Indian Civil Rights Act."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,290.3,299.285,"In that circumstance, then I think the inquiry would focus on what level of procedural fairness is being applied in tribal courts in the absence of that kind of Federal oversight."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,311.81,315.425,So it would be a case-by-case determination?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,315.425,324.28,"Yes, I think that in that situation, there would be no grounds to say that the Constitution categorically prohibits Congress from defining the elements of the crime in that way."
2015.15-420,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,342.74,355.865,"We already do that, don't we, in the career armed felony statute because we permit reliance on foreign convictions, correct?"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,355.865,360.21,I -- I'm not sure that the ACCA permits reliance on foreign convictions.
2015.15-420,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,365.06,374.115,So that we already put in play the issue of whether an individual in a foreign proceeding follows due process or not.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,374.115,374.79,That's right.
2015.15-420,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,382.11,385.03,"And this due process is not raised in this case at all, right --"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,385.03,385.95,That's absolutely correct --
2015.15-420,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,385.95,386.33,-- by Respondent?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,386.33,392.965,-- it's not raised here. Respondent never attempted to argue that there was anything wrong with his prior tribal-court convictions.
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.89,432.535,"If he hasn't raised it here, are you suggesting by reserving it in this case, that on remand, that issue could be aired?"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,432.535,452.12,"I don't think that it would be a live issue on remand, because Respondent has never sought it at any stage of the proceedings to make this kind of claim that there was any unfairness in his tribal-court proceedings or that he was wrongfully convicted in tribal court. And I should emphasize, too, Justice Ginsburg, that if he had that kind of claim, he had alternative channels to raise it previously."
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.12,464.845,"Can you tell me just as a matter of practice, if you know, are these claims of -- of unfairness in individual tribes made often or in recent years, in cases like this?"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,464.845,465.81,So --
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.81,467.095,I just don't know.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,467.095,474.775,I'm not aware -- I'm not aware of any case in which someone has tried to make this kind of as-applied due process challenge that we've been discussing.
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,509.885,519.445,I thought the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers had discussion of a few prosecutions where those claims were raised.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,519.445,520.23,Yes.
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,571.19,579.235,"Well, but how would that work in a case like this? I mean, let's say there are procedural deficiencies in one of the predicate prosecutions."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,602.79,605.51,"Yes, I think he is stuck with the decision he made."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,616.3,619.585,"Well, maybe he didn't have any -- maybe he didn't have any reason to challenge it."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,651.795,653.34,"Well, that's absolutely the case."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,713.79,730.24,"I don't -- I -- I saw that argument in -- in your brief, and I'm not sure I'm quite -- well, I'm not sure I agree with it. I mean, the -- the idea you're saying is that, well, if there's three offenses and on the third one, you get this much enhanced penalty, that that's only for the third one."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,747.24,781.69,"That might be true as a practical matter, but I think this Court has recognized that as a legal matter and as a constitutional matter, the sentence is imposed only for the latest offense. And the Court made this particularly clear, I think, in Nichols where it said that, although obviously the defendant was exposed to additional punishment based on the fact that he had the prior conviction, still, the -- the penalty in the recidivist prosecution was wholly attributable to the instant offense and not to anything that came before it. And -- and I think the contrary ruling would call into question some of the Court's double jeopardy context or ex post facto laws."
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,801.88,824.075,Bryant makes -- makes a distinction between a sentence enhancement on the one hand and the case where the prior conviction counts as an element of the current offense. Would you address what that argument was?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,824.075,824.9,Yes.
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,887.97,895.215,"But the proof would be simply submitting, I suppose, a certified copy of the judgment of conviction."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,895.215,896.14,That's correct.
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,907.095,928.685,"Should there be distinctions between prior, A, acts; B, convictions, that in one case would result in a -- the commission of a crime, and in another case, just enhance the sentence? Should there ever be a distinction?"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,928.685,935.585,I can't think of one in the context of -- of this kind of recidivist prosecution that would require a distinction.
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.99,944.4,Could you use the existence of a civil judgment for domestic assault to enhance a criminal sentence?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,944.4,947.155,I don't think there would be any constitutional problem with that.
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.99,948.08,Okay.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,957.745,961.24,"Yes, I think that's right. And I don't think that anything in the Constitution would prohibit that."
2015.15-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,961.24,963.84,That's a very extensive -- that's a very extensive argument you're making.
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,963.84,971.705,"Well, there are -- I think that the reason why that's not constitutionally problematic is because those civil adjudications are -- are valid."
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1058.555,1071.11,"Do we know why -- why Congress, in the Indian Civil Rights Act, made the right to counsel narrower than the right in the Sixth Amendment?"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,1071.11,1083.7,"I think that Congress, when it enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, after years of studying this issue, was sensitive to balancing autonomy for tribes and tribal sovereignty against individual rights."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1125.955,1128.185,So -- so they knew better than Madison?
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,1128.185,1129.32,Well --
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.32,1136.01,"Madison -- the drafters of the bill, they thought, well, maybe the right to counsel was necessary here but Congress think it's not that necessary."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,1136.01,1144.105,"But as I was just saying, even under the Sixth Amendment, even where it applies it doesn't preclude adjudicating the guilt of a defendant in State or Federal court."
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1213.485,1226.44,"The tribal -- there was a limit -- I think has been raised -- there is a limit on the punishment, the incarceration that a tribal court could order."
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,1229.775,1233.345,"Originally, I believe it was six months, and then it was lengthened to one year."
2015.15-420,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.8,1237.69,"One year, and now it's three years?"
2015.15-420,0,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,1237.69,1289.035,"That's correct, yes. Actually, I think this is notable because I think it shows that Congress, in recent years, every time it's looked at how tribal courts are functioning and has made a determination about the rights and -- and what to recognize in those tribal-court proceedings, it's acted to recognize expanded authority for tribal courts, both with their sentencing authority, with respect to their jurisdiction. So I do think that that reflects legislative judgment that tribal courts are sufficiently protective of individual rights, and that there's no fundamental unfairness that's occurring in those proceedings that would cause, I think, this Court to question the reliability of those determinations. And I would point again to Respondent's concession that if he had simply been fined in tribal court and had not received a sentence of imprisonment, then there would be no problem with giving effect to those tribal-court convictions."
2015.15-420,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1305.03,1311.625,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Babcock."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1311.625,1361.585,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The right to counsel is fundamental and essential in our country, and that is something that needs to be adhered to. Using the tribal-court convictions in which Mr. Bryant was not afforded counsel, then turning them into an essential element of a 117(a) prosecution, runs afoul what -- what this Court has stated is a fundamental right for 53 years. If we take a look at the cases that deal with the Sixth Amendment analysis, from Johnson, to Gideon, to Burgett, to Tucker, to Loper, reliability has been the core concern of every single one of those decisions."
2015.15-420,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.585,1404.69,"Do you do -- disagree with -- I think Ms. Prelogar said that you -- you acknowledged that if the only sentence had been a fine, no jail time, that these -- these two prior battery misdemeanors, if the -- the tribal court gave only a fine and no jail time, then those convictions could be used under for a 117 prosecution."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1404.69,1405.36,Correct.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1497.7,1498.76,I'm sorry.
2015.15-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1499.315,1502.57,My thought is this is quite formalistic.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1529.87,1538.015,"Well, and I think it's the way that we take a look at it -- and I think it's important if we take a look at what Justice Scalia stated in the Crawford case."
2015.15-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1571.15,1577.88,"But as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you could make the same argument if it had been just a fine and no Sixth Amendment violation."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1577.88,1580.5,"Exactly, but what we're asking this Court --"
2015.15-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1580.5,1587.24,"So I don't understand why one is reliable and the other is not reliable, other than the formalistic argument which I can understand."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1587.24,1594.09,"And we are certainly not saying that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is reliable, and neither does Nichols."
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.61,1619.51,But did anybody object at that time and say this sentence is unconstitutional?
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1619.51,1619.91,No.
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1620.99,1621.755,"Okay, so --"
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1621.755,1622.94,-- did not have a right to counsel.
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1622.94,1623.11,Fine.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1628.07,1629.445,"I a.m., Your Honor."
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1629.445,1632.37,You have? Where did you say that in your brief? Because they say you didn't.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1632.37,1635.55,"I -- I, of course, I filed a motion to dismiss on --"
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1635.55,1635.74,"No, no."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1646.995,1647.835,We have not.
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1647.835,1648.515,Okay.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1690.81,1696.52,"Well, Nichols also dealt with an underlying conviction in which the Sixth Amendment did exist."
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.11,1699.21,Yeah.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1715.785,1723.06,"Well, I think the reason why is because of the United States District Court, and certainly, in this Court, the Sixth Amendment does exist."
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.89,1735.92,"And then we should hold that -- I guess, that all of the convictions in all the tribes that are using, going to jail where people might go to prison for more than six months or at all, for a day, all those are invalid."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1735.92,1736.55,If they're --
2015.15-420,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.55,1738.81,Then the law of Congress is unconstitutional.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1744.025,1749.22,"Well, we're certainly not challenging the constitutionality of the Indian Civil Rights Act, but we are certainly --"
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1749.22,1759.215,"Well, that's the question, which is: Standing alone, was that earlier conviction violative of the Constitution?"
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1759.215,1762.35,"It was not, because it was in tribal court."
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.35,1763.62,Right.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1772.48,1773.22,Correct.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1773.22,1775.55,They don't apply to English courts --
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1775.55,1776.25,Correct.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1776.25,1777.53,-- and other foreign courts.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1777.53,1778.095,Correct.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1778.095,1792.48,"And there are plenty of foreign courts, like England for a time -- I think it's changing it now -- where they would convict people after a magisterial inquisition where the defendant didn't have counsel."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1797.33,1800.53,"No, I'm not saying that process violates the Constitution."
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.53,1827.955,"You're saying simply because we're using that conviction, we now violated. Why? Nichols, as I understand it, had two rationales: One that says using a prior constitutional conviction, one that doesn't violate the Constitution, is not enhancing a sentence, is not changing that earlier conviction."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1848.155,1855.035,I think a big reason why is our fundamental difference between guilt phase and sentencing phase.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1857.73,1882.68,"Well, we -- Nichols itself said enhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions, such as those contained in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal law, those recidivist statutes make prior convictions an element, do not change the penalty imposed for an earlier conviction."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1888.86,1889.99,I read --
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1889.99,1895.96,Covered sentencing guidelines and covered recidivist statutes.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1895.96,1902.17,I think the difference here is that it's being used to establish an essential element of the offense.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1902.17,1902.815,"I know, but --"
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1902.815,1903.62,And it -- it's not technically --
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1903.62,1904.46,Nichols said that's okay.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1904.46,1908.705,"It's not technically, we argue, a typical recidivist statute."
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1916.66,1921.93,"No, it says it was relying on recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal laws."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1921.93,1922.785,Correct.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1922.785,1923.41,All right.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1925.605,1938.03,"They make them an element of the crime, but -- but Chief Justice Rehnquist also went on to talk about the less exacting standard that is attached to the sentencing proceeding than at the guilt phase."
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1939.1,1941.05,That's the second prong of Nichols.
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1941.05,1941.58,It is.
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1976.51,1978.78,But isn't that a due process argument?
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,1978.78,1984.96,I believe that the due process and the Sixth Amendment argument are certainly intertwined in this case.
2015.15-420,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.775,1998.19,I can see --
2015.15-420,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.19,1998.54,"Well, that's --"
2015.15-420,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.54,2010.645,"-- the distinction between -- that you made between beyond a reasonable doubt and preponderance of the evidence, but practically, I mean, what's involved here is proof of a conviction entered by a court."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,2019.395,2030.955,"I think that this Court, in taking a look at convictions themselves, if you want to take a look at cases such as Tucker and as Loper, it wasn't enough."
2015.15-420,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.9,2184.78,"What are the -- the cases both Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia suggested that in -- not in this statute, but there are criminal statutes that allow the use of a foreign conviction to count for recidivism purposes, for -- for a variety of purposes."
2015.15-420,1,62697,steven_c_babcock,,2200.475,2218.86,"We do credit those -- those convictions, but we do take a look at whether or not they adhered to the procedural safeguards that we deem as fundamental in this country. And a lot of countries, of course, do not deem the right to counsel as fundamental or essential. We certainly do."
2015.15-420,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2438.11,2442.485,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Prelogar, eight minutes."
2015.15-420,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,2442.485,2452.34,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to begin by responding to Respondent's point that there is a less exacting standard that's applied at sentencing."
2015.15-420,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.11,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
