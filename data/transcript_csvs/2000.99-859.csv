2000.99-859,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.545,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-859, Central Green Company v. the United States."
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,40.867,44.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.768,109.598,Did they concede that it served no flood control purpose?
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,110.978,112.736,"--They being the United States, Your Honor?"
2000.99-859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,112.736,113.313,Yes.
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,113.313,114.139,No.
2000.99-859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.701,120.166,And did the Ninth Circuit said that it served no flood control purpose?
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,120.166,122.495,"Yes, it did, as part of its decision."
2000.99-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.495,135.566,"Now, do you concede that water could be released into the Madera Canal for flood control purposes, for example to make more room in the reservoir for flood waters that are anticipated?"
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,137.256,138.621,Yes.
2000.99-859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.86,154.225,It's liquid gold until December.
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,154.225,163.596,"--Actually, not necessarily, Your Honor, because for most of the years in question they don't put water into that canal even in December."
2000.99-859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.973,176.637,"Well, I have to say... I recognize the case is here on dismissal of the pleadings."
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,176.637,177.463,Correct.
2000.99-859,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.463,184.894,"And that you have indicated in your brief that in some events maybe the case should go back, that we shouldn't just rule for the Government."
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,198.64,212.553,"That issue was not briefed at the Ninth Circuit level, Your Honor, but the canal itself was authorized under the reclamation laws and 100 percent of its costs were reimbursed to the United States under those rules."
2000.99-859,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,217.504,246.649,"Well, can't it be, though... I mean, the Government points out in the brief that there are limitations in a flood situation on the amount of water that can be discharged downstream, and in order to comply with those limitations they might have to use this canal to run off surplus water, so the United States is saying that there certainly are situations in which this canal would have a flood control use."
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,249.166,249.827,I do.
2000.99-859,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,249.827,250.448,Okay.
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,250.448,259.486,"But the fact of the matter is that the facility itself is operated... if that ever occurred, still it would be a question of fact we'd have to address below, but--"
2000.99-859,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.486,269.024,And you would say that if the escaping water resulted from that particular kind of flood control use there would be immunity.
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,279.631,281.283,"--That is exactly correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.283,281.572,Yeah.
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,295.94,303.12,"Flood waters consist of, and I think this Court's statement in United States v. James at page 605 is relatively clear."
2000.99-859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.773,318.435,"Well, related... related to... I mean, that's pretty wide."
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,320.953,326.32,"I would challenge that a little bit, Your Honor, respectfully."
2000.99-859,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.163,337.921,You acknowledge it's remotely enough... it's remotely related to flood control in that should there be a flood they can release some of the excess flood waters through this canal.
2000.99-859,0,42887,timothy_jones,,337.921,359.32,"--That might make the canal remotely related to flood control, but it doesn't make the waters that are passing through the canal... under circumstances in the middle of summer, it's 100 degrees out, the river is dry down below the dam 20 miles, and they're diverting the water into the canal under contractual obligations, where it's bought and paid for."
2000.99-859,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1714.182,1725.615,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-859,2,42887,timothy_jones,,3535.377,3536.287,"Thank you, Your Honor."
