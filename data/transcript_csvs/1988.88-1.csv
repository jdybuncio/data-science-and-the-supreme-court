1988.88-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.622,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-1, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Association."
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,11.805,12.022,Thank you.
1988.88-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.401,164.02,"Is this... is this pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Mr. Morikawa?"
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,164.02,165.055,"--No, your Honor, it was not."
1988.88-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.684,198.593,"Mr. Morikawa, I gather that before 1987 the medical screening did not include testing for drug use except on the basis of particularized suspicion."
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,199.409,206.449,The lower court in this case characterized the kind of drug testing that had been done as being done on particularized suspicion.
1988.88-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.853,215.221,"But we accept that as the case, do we not?"
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,215.221,238.753,"As a matter of fact, we believe that if you look into the practices of the parties that did exist, it included not just testing at the discretion of a physician, as in that situation, but it also included drug testing that had been done by Conrail on a broader base in 1984 when for a period of six months it implemented drug testing across the board and part of these routine physical examinations."
1988.88-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.753,246.34,Do you see any limits on the tests that Conrail could require for medical testing?
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,259.85,264.902,"We contend that Conrail had the right to determine fitness for duty, as it had been its practice."
1988.88-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.902,265.452,Uh-huh.
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,265.452,269.889,The question of whether or not AIDS relates to fitness for duty is certainly problematic.
1988.88-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,309.547,314.068,"Well, their system didn't work very well with respect to the Maryland disaster, did it?"
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,314.068,316.02,"--It certainly did not, your Honor."
1988.88-1,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,371.421,375.725,"Now, you have a new test out, I'll put it that way."
1988.88-1,0,21277,dennis_j_morikawa,,394.703,398.924,"The test that's involved in this case, your Honor, is a urine sample, not a blood test."
1988.88-1,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1762.078,1765.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.52,1799.586,Where do we find that?
1988.88-1,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1800.503,1812.209,"2 First, your Honor, is at page 131 of the Joint Appendix."
1988.88-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.709,1890.894,"--So, one of the critical question is, is this a change or not?"
1988.88-1,1,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1890.894,1892.513,"That is correct, your Honor."
