1997.96-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.058,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1577, Alaska v. The Native Village of, is it Venetie?"
1997.96-1577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,12.058,14.224,"Venetie, Venetie."
1997.96-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,14.224,16.093,Venetie.
1997.96-1577,1,27439,heather_r_kendall,,52.682,53.416,Venetie.
1997.96-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.416,54.082,Venetie.
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,56.584,58.936,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.651,119.291,"Mr. Roberts, why do you suppose Congress didn't just mention somewhere in this settlement act section 1151's dependent Indian community notion?"
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,121.426,123.112,"Well, it's often the case that--"
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.112,126.064,--to include a little phrase there somewhere about that.
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,128.348,135.086,--I think because Congress in 1971 had no reason to suppose that there was any such Indian country in Alaska.
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.924,145.107,There were some reservations.
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,145.107,154.113,"--There were reservations, and they were revoked, so to the extent there was Indian country that they would be aware of, they took action very expressly to extinguish it."
1997.96-1577,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.113,160.017,But most of the land that was conveyed was not Indian country under the then-prevailing jurisprudence.
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,160.017,166.754,"That's correct and, in fact, it was not Indian country under the accepted concept as it had developed in the lower 48."
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.754,173.091,I have some... I have another just kind of basic question here that you can help me with.
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,205.379,206.596,"Yes, and in fact many--"
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.596,208.831,"Has it done so, to your knowledge?"
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,208.831,209.564,--Venetie has not done so.
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.564,210.2,But it could.
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,210.2,210.8,"It could, yes."
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.8,217.536,"Now, if it did that, could it impose taxes like any other municipality in Alaska?"
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,217.536,219.138,It would have the same authority.
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.165,237.617,"Well, how does it apply?"
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.235,242.535,--No.
1997.96-1577,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.951,243.585,--a municipality?
1997.96-1577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.585,245.487,--incorporated as a borough--
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1513.395,1516.145,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.164,1552.036,"Well, Ms. Kendall, I thought Venetie had a reservation actually, originally."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1552.036,1554.17,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.924,1554.17,It was a reservation.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1560.524,1561.442,That is correct.
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1561.442,1566.696,And I thought that the statute that was passed did abolish the reservation.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1566.696,1580.103,"Your Honor, 1151(b) includes three categories of Indian country, reservations, dependent Indian communities, and allotments, and although it is true that ANCSA eliminated Venetie's reservation status--"
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.103,1580.553,Right.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1580.553,1582.122,--as a basis for Indian country--
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.122,1582.439,Right.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1582.439,1602.536,"--under 1151(b), ANCSA expressly left in place Indian country in the form of over 10,000 Native allotments under section 1617, and Native allotments are per se Indian country under 1151(c), so Congress clearly did not abolish all forms of Indian country through that particular provision."
1997.96-1577,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.616,1648.915,"Ms. Kendall, what do you do with section 1601(b), in which ANCSA said that it's purpose was to convey the land to the Indian people with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property without establishing any permanently racially defined institutions, rights, privileges, or obligations, and without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardship or trusteeship?"
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1648.915,1650.35,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1577,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.892,1716.825,"Well, you say to get them out of their control."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1723.479,1723.914,I disagree.
1997.96-1577,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.914,1730.402,It's quite in... it seems to me incompatible to say that you want to get them out of the control and yet you still want it to be Indian country.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1730.402,1743.559,"Your Honor, section 16... I mean, 1151(b), the category that covers the Indian communities, that particular category does not turn on lands being in Federal ownership."
1997.96-1577,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.879,1752.213,Dependency.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1756.95,1762.437,"Not the dependency, the BIA control over development issues of their land."
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1818.107,1829.431,"Does that... the dependent community status remain if the tribe moves to a different area, so they bring that Indian country designation to a new area if they choose to move?"
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1829.431,1851.661,"It's not our position, Justice Kennedy, that a tribe can unilaterally create Indian country, but if a... the Federal Government treats with and recognizes and deals with a particular Indian community as Indian country, as being under its Federal guardianship and protection, then that area has been found to be a dependent Indian community."
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.661,1852.144,Ms. Kendall--
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1861.886,1870.206,"I agree, Your Honor, that 1151 focuses on land and on territory, areas that are occupied, but 1151(b)--"
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.206,1872.242,And this is necessarily part of the dependent Indian--
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1872.242,1872.842,--Indian community--
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1872.842,1873.444,--community definition.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1873.444,1876.396,"--That's correct, Your Honor, that Congress--"
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.396,1883.3,"And yet that seems somewhat inconsistent with the theory of the act, which was to change territorial designation."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1883.3,1885.768,--It did not change territorial designation.
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.037,1928.143,"Well, do you say that the Federal Government recognizes Venetie as a tribe and... and it offers some accompanying benefits to the tribe."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1935.498,1940.383,"No, I do not think that Federal recognition in just services is sufficient."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.739,1959.464,"Well, what else is it that you say is necessary to create Indian country here, other than the fact that the Federal Government recognizes the tribe and offers these--"
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1959.464,1961.081,They likewise have to--
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1961.081,1962.266,--aids and benefits?
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1962.266,1972.589,"--treat the area that the tribe occupies as being an area that is the residence of tribal Indians under Federal protection, and that is present with Venetie."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.827,1994.704,"What if the corporation, which is the one that conveyed the land back to the... to Venetie Village, what if the corporation had sold some land to some non-Indians before it did that."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1995.62,1996.487,"--Well, I would submit--"
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.487,1996.822,What would that be?
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,1996.822,2000.44,"--That would be a fact that is not present here, but--"
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.44,2000.807,Right.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2000.807,2015.8,"--I would submit that that, depending on the nature of the case and the facts involved there, that that would likely not qualify as Indian country, but here, where you have a case like Venetie, who owns the total, the land base that it occupied prior to--"
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2015.8,2020.335,"Well, but is the touchstone congressional intent?"
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2021.453,2023.02,"--Congressional intent, yes."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.02,2024.37,Isn't that the touchstone here?
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2024.37,2024.953,That is true.
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2024.953,2025.972,Whether there's Indian country?
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2025.972,2026.355,That is true.
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.355,2036.328,"And here, Congress provided that the land title would go to these State-chartered corporations, not to Venetie."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2046.7,2055.473,"If I may, Your Honor, Congress fully knew that it was conveying the lands to the Venetie residents even if it was doing so through the corporation."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2055.473,2068.28,"Gee, I thought it... I thought what was done was that pursuant to the congressional act the lands were conveyed to these State-chartered corporations, not only in the Venetie area but other areas in Alaska."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2068.28,2072.501,"Under the act, it was the villages that were found eligible and entitled to receive lands."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2084.725,2085.641,Was title conveyed to the corporations?
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2085.641,2086.108,"Yes, they were."
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2086.108,2086.658,Yes.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2086.658,2094.347,"But if I can direct your attention to 1618(b) in our brief, in appendix 63a, that provision says--"
1997.96-1577,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.347,2095.797,"Where again is that, Ms--"
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2095.797,2097.449,--63a in our appendix.
1997.96-1577,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.449,2102.584,--Thank you.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2102.584,2113.456,"If you look up on the top of the page at 63a, it says, estates in any reserve set aside for the use or benefit of its stockholders or members--"
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2113.456,2115.122,I'm having trouble seeing this.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2115.856,2117.841,--63a of the appendix.
1997.96-1577,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.841,2119.61,--That's what I'm looking at.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2124.912,2125.514,63a.
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2125.514,2126.547,"Oh, estates."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2127.797,2128.799,Excuse me.
1997.96-1577,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.799,2129.882,I think that's the problem.
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2130.816,2140.273,"Estates in any reserve set aside for the use or benefit of its stockholders or members prior to December 18, 1971."
1997.96-1577,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.828,2210.267,"Well, but wasn't something more accomplished, and that was, once the title had changed, as I understand it there was no limitation on what the then titleholder could do."
1997.96-1577,3,27439,heather_r_kendall,,2224.96,2245.423,"The titleholder does have free rein in terms of the alienability aspect of the land, but until those lands leave Indian ownership they are treated by Congress as being under Federal protections for purposes against State taxation, against foreclosure, against a judgment, creditors, against even the involuntary dissolution--"
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3248.422,3249.588,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-1577,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.874,3283.56,How could it footnote that if it wasn't published?
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.893,3290.046,"It's not technically been published in the collected volumes, but it's not a secret."
1997.96-1577,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.346,3292.415,"I see, sort of been smuggled out."
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3293.615,3298.735,"Not smuggled, but certainly made public."
1997.96-1577,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3335.708,3337.627,But it was anticipated by it.
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.227,3347.633,"--Oh, Your Honor, I don't think there was any reason to anticipate that the ANCSA corporations would reconvey the land and dissolve, not at all."
1997.96-1577,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3379.704,3381.639,It remains a recognized tribe.
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.639,3385.258,"Absolutely, and nothing in the State's position is inconsistent with that."
1997.96-1577,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3388.793,3394.964,"Superintendence being... what do you pin that last statement on, there's now no superintendence, before there was?"
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.964,3401.887,"Well, if you look at it in two ways, either... the most significant one is control over the decisions."
1997.96-1577,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3421.364,3427.685,"Do you agree that dependency means, dependent on the Government for protection of your tribal status?"
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3427.685,3430.97,"Well, again, we think it is a part of the term of art."
1997.96-1577,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3443.13,3452.919,"Could the Federal Government come along today, pass a... could Congress pass a statute and say today, binding upon this tribe, saying you shall take no muskrat upon your land?"
1997.96-1577,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3452.919,3459.906,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because that would be inconsistent with ANCSA, which gave to them jurisdiction and control over the land."
1997.96-1577,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.476,3515.476,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
