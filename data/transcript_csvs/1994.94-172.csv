1994.94-172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.428,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-172, John Bruce Hubbard v. The United States."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,9.507,12.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,100.87,102.57,These answers were verified?
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,102.57,103.879,The third conviction arose as a result of a discovery dispute.
1994.94-172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.879,104.059,None of these answers were verified?
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,104.059,104.66,"No, they were not."
1994.94-172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.875,190.877,"Well, Bramblett stands in your way."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,194.14,205.095,"--It is, Your Honor, dictum in Bramblett that stands in our way, and for that reason, we do not believe that the Court will run into the problem of stare decisis, as the Government would suggest."
1994.94-172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.115,222.617,"Well, it certainly has been followed in the intervening years, hasn't it?"
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,222.617,239.04,"--Well, the courts of appeals, because of Bramblett, have felt constrained to hold that such statement that... to hold that 1001 applies to the courts because of the dictum in Bramblett, and it is with several misgivings that the courts of appeals have noted that."
1994.94-172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.622,255.008,"What Bramblett decided, though, not really by way of dictum, was that it was not limit... 1001 was not limited to the executive branch."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,255.008,263.704,"But the issue before Bramblett, Your Honor, was not a statement made to the judiciary, it was a statement made to the legislative branch, and in fact--"
1994.94-172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.704,278.665,"Yes, but once you say it doesn't apply to the... it's not limited to the executive branch but it extends to the legislative branch, it seems to me it's very hard to carve out of the statute a meaning that says, it covers executive and legislative but not judicial."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,278.665,281.058,"--But nevertheless, that is what the statute says."
1994.94-172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.469,303.18,What about Congress?
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,303.18,303.861,I'm sorry?
1994.94-172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.861,305.031,What about Congress?
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,306.603,309.535,"No, it states that--"
1994.94-172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.535,311.398,"Well, there goes your plain language argument out the window."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,314.69,323.128,"--And we are asking, even if you are looking at the holding of Bramblett, if the holding of Bramblett is deemed at issue, we're asking the Court to recede from the holding of Bramblett."
1994.94-172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.128,324.898,So you're not really talking just about dicta.
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,324.898,332.401,"Well, technically, yes, we are, because Bramblett did not involve... in the sense that Bramblett did not involve a statement to the judiciary, yes."
1994.94-172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.99,346.252,"Well, there is certainly no principal distinction for purposes of making a plain language argument."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,346.252,348.624,"Well, there isn't--"
1994.94-172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.624,352.076,"If you want to make a plain language argument, you must ask us to overrule Bramblett."
1994.94-172,0,38128,paul_morris,,352.076,359.933,"--Yes, and Bramblett runs counter to the plain language argument and to the definition supplied by Congress of the term ""department""."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,873.932,885.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.707,967.14,"Yes, but isn't it true that the history of this statute was one of false claims against the Government, usually monetary claims, and the particular false statement in Bramblett was in support of a monetary claim made to the disbursing officer, so isn't it conceivable that one could say the holding goes only to those departments of the judiciary or the legislature that perform similar functions to the departments in the executive branch that process claims against the Government?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,967.14,970.433,"No, Justice Stevens, and primarily for two reasons."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.78,984.392,I'm no sure the opinion... that's a correct reading of the opinion.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,987.735,1012.671,"--In Bramblett it was argued, and the Court noted, that the matter involved... and this is on page 509 of the opinion... was within the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, and the misstatements could be taken, therefore, to be misstatements to the Treasury, because the money would come out of the Treasury."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.319,1032.484,"Yes, but that... that's what you rely on for saying that it was... you think the rationale would apply to an unsworn statement at a committee hearing?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1032.484,1038.548,"Yes, and in fact the District of Columbia Circuit held as much in the Poindexter case."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.302,1072.752,The Congress did.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1072.752,1074.112,--Congress did.
1994.94-172,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.318,1125.085,"Mr. Bress, suppose I think that the case was... Bramblett was incorrectly decided."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1171.705,1184.234,"Well, if the Court took the approach of only applying Bramblett to Congress, then the Court would essentially be overturning the overarching rationale of the case."
1994.94-172,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.234,1187.957,"Sure, but I'm saying, I'm under the impression that's quite a common thing."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1209.699,1215.693,"That approach we believe would suffer the same faults as overturning the case in its entirety, in the following sense."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.603,1284.41,"Yes, but you're asking us to change course on a lot of courts of appeals who have thought this was not really what was intended and have developed this kind of ironic judicial exception."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1290.763,1293.625,--There's law out there that supports the exception.
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.955,1294.546,By several courts.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1294.546,1303.34,"--We would contend that that law is not based on the text of the statute, not based on any discernible history, and not based on any legitimate policy rationale."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.34,1320.854,"Well, can't one read the definition of ""department"", which says it means the executive department unless the context reads otherwise, and couldn't one say the context does indicate otherwise when there's a monetary claim against another branch of the Government, such as the disbursing officer of the legislature, or one of our disbursing officers... that's a similar claim."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1327.706,1340.756,"After the statute was amended in '34 and in light of this Court's holding in Gilliland, we do not agree that you can read context to give any special sort of a notice to false statements made in connection with false claims."
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1355.286,1367.234,"Does the context refer literally only to the words of the statute, or does the context include the historical understanding behind those words?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1381.813,1390.539,"If the lawyer intentionally misrepresents facts, the lawyer may be prosecutable under section 1001."
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1401.335,1412.444,"Well, let's say that's one way... there's a difference, though, between a closing argument and the reference to facts there, and the factual implications of entering a plea, which in fact--"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1412.444,1413.183,Yes.
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1413.183,1414.374,--is the distinction that you recognize.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1469.629,1489.585,"It might be a proper contextual argument, except that we would take the position that the overlap of section 1001 on top of, as you say, more specific context... for example, this is... the trial context exists not only in the judicial branch but also in the legislature and also in the executive branch."
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1489.585,1497.069,"So you're saying if you do what I was exploring, in fact you are going to read out a great deal of the ostensible application of the statute?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1497.069,1497.99,That is correct.
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1497.99,1499.701,So we shouldn't do what I was suggesting?
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1499.701,1502.151,That is my position.
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1502.151,1503.332,"Oh, is that your position?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1504.023,1515.873,"To be more specific, section 1001 does overlap many more specific prohibitions and ways of dealing with things in the judicial branch and outside of it."
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1569.719,1577.223,"You are supposed to interpret an ambiguous statute in the direction of lenity, and why isn't it ambiguous?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1626.695,1635.082,"Well, firstly, in terms of the context, we disagree that the context is ambiguous, particularly if you compare it with the legislative context."
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1638.484,1645.518,"Well, I suppose the distinction might be that people very often go to Congress... very often... in order to get money from the United States Government."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1660.568,1673.266,"--The 1934 amendment to the act was passed mostly at the urging of the Department of the Interior, which was concerned about falsifications of statements made in connection with hot oil shipments."
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.602,1716.644,"So when I go back to the legislative history I would find that money has nothing to do with this statute, that in fact what Congress wanted to do was to say, if you make a false statement to the postman, you say, hey, I used to live on Apple Street... indictable offense, even though it's not under oath, because now he may go to the wrong place?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1718.657,1726.191,"The limitation that you are looking for, we believe, would be provided by the materiality requirement in section 1001."
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.338,1736.7,Because the postman will go to the wrong address.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1740.221,1753.159,"--Well, I defer to the Court's decision on that matter, but I... nonetheless, the point remains that in 1934 Congress did intend to reach nonmonetary fraud."
1994.94-172,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1762.506,1774.984,"Mr. Bress, even if one accepts that the concern is making false statements to the Government, what about the distinction that the Second Circuit made in D'Amato that Mr. Morris brought up at the end of his argument?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1792.675,1821.004,"In our view, the decision of the Second Circuit in D'Amato was basically a different way of saying that the Second Circuit didn't agree with Bramblett in the first place, because the Second Circuit was essentially saying that a lie in a judicial context is only going to fall within 1001 if the lie was essentially to the Government as executive on the other side of the case, that the lie to the court, which might pervert the court's decisionmaking functions, would not fall within the statute."
1994.94-172,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.291,1834.433,"Mr. Bress, I'd feel better if I thought Bramblett was right."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1838.685,1841.867,We believe that Bramblett was correctly decided.
1994.94-172,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.863,1851.584,I knew you were going to say that.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1851.584,1853.074,"I was trying not to say, legislative history."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.495,1869.787,"But in Bramblett the Court said that Congress could not have intended to leave frauds such as this without penalty, and this is with a characteristic false claim just like you usually make to the executive branch."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1883.505,1888.478,"If that were the only, or the primary rationale for the decision in Bramblett--"
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.478,1890.26,"It's not the primary rationale, but it's the holding."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1890.26,1891.689,--Well--
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.689,1899.414,"The holding is that Congress didn't intend frauds such as this, the claim for money made to the disbursing officer, to be uncovered by the statute."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1899.414,1909.131,"--Justice Stevens, we take the holding in Bramblett to be that section 1001 was not intended to be restricted to the executive branch but, rather, reach the legislative and judicial branches."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.131,1914.045,"That's correct, but it doesn't necessary mean that it covers everything that happens in the judicial and legislative branches."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1914.045,1921.449,"Yes, but the functional distinction that I believe you were making would be inconsistent with this Court's decision in Rodgers, because in Rodgers--"
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1921.449,1923.76,But Rodgers was an executive department case.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1934.859,1944.485,"--But then I believe you are caught by Bramblett's other hook, which is that the 1934 amendment was not intended to restrict the false statements to the executive branch."
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.777,1952.31,But those were in support of false claims at that time.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1952.31,1952.981,"Yes, and--"
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.981,1953.201,And not--
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1953.201,1966.191,--what the Court decided in Bramblett was that Congress in 1934 intended to broaden the types of false claims that could be prosecutable without narrowing the false claims to any particular branch of Government.
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1966.191,1978.078,"--No, but the broadening could have covered the normal meaning of department, which is the executive, and also the old-fashioned meaning for legislative and judicial frauds."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1978.078,1989.035,"The Court defined ""department"" in Bramblett to include all three, and did not purport to make a distinction based on the function that that department was then performing."
1994.94-172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.035,1993.139,"Gilliland is not a false claim statute, is it?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1999.042,2000.873,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.001,2013.401,And that was decided in 1941.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2013.401,2024.057,"Yes, only 7 years after the 1934 amendments, and notably 7 years before the 1948 enactment of the definition of department in section 6."
1994.94-172,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2024.057,2035.825,"I take it the Government argued in Bramblett that ultimately the Treasury would disburse these moneys, and so there was fraud upon the executive branch in any event."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2035.825,2039.038,The Government had a narrower argument than argument today in Bramblett.
1994.94-172,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2048.685,2055.609,"So under the Government's position, this conduct could have been punishable without the expansive reading that the Supreme Court gave in Bramblett?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2055.609,2056.217,That's correct.
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2149.62,2160.719,"Isn't one of the things that we should worry about is not what theoretically would be covered by this, but by the sort of interorum effect of the statute if it is going to have the meaning, the breadth that you give it?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2205.239,2207.55,I've got a number of responses.
1994.94-172,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2236.498,2240.051,"Well, that's because they don't have the decision of this case as you want it handed down yet."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2244.814,2259.161,"We don't believe there's much reason to think so, because obstruction of justice under 1503 could currently be a basis for making such charges against a lawyer who has knowingly made false statements in courts."
1994.94-172,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.161,2268.738,Do any of the separate States have statutes that specifically punish misrepresentations in judicial proceedings?
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2271.149,2272.642,"Other than perjury, Your Honor?"
1994.94-172,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2272.642,2273.132,Yes.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2273.132,2274.102,I do not know.
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.102,2280.246,"May I also ask you, going back to the legislature... you cited the Poindexter case as one."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2287.532,2288.921,I don't know--
1994.94-172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.921,2292.145,Because there must have been a lot of them over the two odd ones.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2306.905,2309.229,--The obstruction statute for Congress?
1994.94-172,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2309.229,2313.809,"Yes, and that statute has two parts, as I recall."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2325.758,2328.94,In that statute that may be so.
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2338.747,2353.808,"Is that a general view of your office, that those false statements that are prosecutable under 1001 in respect to a judicial or congressional proceeding must be such as they would support an obstruction of justice conviction?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2353.808,2356.098,I think it would generally be the case.
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.539,2357.958,Is it absolutely the case?
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2364.473,2372.608,"--Well, obstruction of justice includes the term ""corruptly"", and so the question there would be whether ""corruptly"" adds anything to the term ""intentionally""."
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.48,2389.541,"This may go well beyond, then, any kind of a false statement at all made to a clerk of a court, or what about a prisoner who writes a letter about prison conditions, knowing it will be attached, though unsworn?"
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2389.541,2390.35,If it's a--
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.35,2391.892,What about the... et cetera.
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2391.892,2397.104,"--If it's an intentional false statement of fact, it would be prosecutable under section 1001."
1994.94-172,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.489,2413.174,"Then a prisoner who says, after all, the food has... you know, has 90,00 different complaints, and some of them are not true."
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2417.298,2428.986,"Intentional false statement would be covered so long as it was material, and the decision as to the breadth of 1001, as this Court pointed out in Rodgers, is not a decision for this Court, but is rather a decision for Congress."
1994.94-172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.986,2431.006,What if the prisoner made a false statement to the warden?
1994.94-172,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,2436.821,2438.582,"It certainly would, Your Honor."
1994.94-172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.154,2444.947,"Very well, Mr. Bress."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2447.127,2448.189,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.591,2490.494,Are you suggesting the consequences to the losing lawyer are different in a civil proceeding than in a criminal proceeding?
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2490.494,2505.976,"There are other implications involved in the criminal proceedings, namely the constitutional implications that are not involved in the civil proceedings, and it would seem to me that the consequences are much more far-reaching in civil because of the absence of those protections."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.976,2513.262,And how about lawyers who lose cases before administrative law judges in the executive branches?
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2513.262,2519.804,"It would seem to me, under the Government's interpretation, that 1001 applies to those situations as well, but--"
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.804,2522.986,"But under your interpretation it would, too, would it not?"
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2522.986,2523.707,--Yes.
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.707,2529.051,So I mean we've... lawyers are going to have something to worry about no matter how this case comes out.
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2529.051,2532.433,"Well, that brings us back to the Government's discussion of Bramblett."
1994.94-172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.433,2534.273,Why are you worrying about losing lawyers?
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2541.309,2566.446,"Certainly an equally and perhaps more compelling grave concern would be the lawyers and litigants in that situation as well, so the breadth that's being read into this statute by the Government cuts virtually cross the board, and how can it reasonably be argued that Congress ever intended that 1001 would have such a reach into not just criminal litigation, but into civil litigation?"
1994.94-172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.839,2588.97,"He just doesn't have to lie, that's all."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2591.381,2592.673,--But the realities of the situation--
1994.94-172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.673,2593.953,"The reality is, it's a criminal prosecution."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2602.227,2612.044,"--But what happens, Your Honor, when the... that client who comes to that lawyer at the eleventh hour is making misrepresentations that wind up in that complaint and the lawyer doesn't find that out till after it's filed?"
1994.94-172,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2613.346,2618.742,"Well, it's not based on negligence, it's based on a knowing and wilful falsification."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2618.742,2624.275,"--Which... which should once we look at the facts of this case, afford the Court small consolation."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2663.181,2666.932,But that's a finding of fact that can't be challenged here.
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2666.932,2669.275,"But it shows with what ease, Your Honor--"
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.275,2675.918,"Well, this petitioner here did knowingly and intentionally fail to turn something over."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2675.918,2678.759,"--Well, we're assuming that for the sake of this case, of course."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2678.759,2682.131,"Well, you assume it because a jury found it unanimously in a criminal case."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2682.131,2688.366,"Correct, but that demonstrates the ease with which those terms can be interpreted and--"
1994.94-172,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2688.366,2688.997,"Well, I don't know that it does."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2718.266,2732.848,"--Yes, but some of the cases where it is easier to draw the line, and if this Court views this as one of those such cases, adopting the Government's argument, we are going to necessarily lead to those grayer areas which necessarily impact upon the every day practice of law, and every--"
1994.94-172,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2732.848,2743.594,"If you want to carve out the judiciary, then do you have a problem in this case, because the bankruptcy judge is not an Article III judge?"
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2743.594,2759.435,"--No, Your Honor, my under... although that issue was not briefed and the Government has never challenged that the bankruptcy judge is part of a court, it's my understanding that the bankruptcy court is a division of the United States district courts, and that... and it was never contested that this was a judicial proceeding."
1994.94-172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.435,2763.246,What is so sacrosanct about lawyers?
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2787.562,2797.95,"It's not that, Your Honor, that lawyers are so sacrosanct or that the litigants are, or that we're asking for an exception to be carved out of 1001 for only their protection."
1994.94-172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2814.63,2830.311,"Although you're perfectly willing to say that they assume that every unsworn representation made by any businessman when he fills out, you know, page 2003 of some form that a Federal agency has sent to him... that Congress intended, but not that a lawyer should be held to honesty as well."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2830.311,2832.231,"--Well, we... of course--"
1994.94-172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.231,2834.823,"It isn't self-evident to me, that's all I can say."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2857.918,2875.67,"--Well, we submit that the Government's contention that disapproving or limiting Bramblett is going to cause a change of conduct, or a change of the course of the law, whether it's dramatic or otherwise, is really not borne out by what has happened since the Morgan decision in 1962."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.844,2917.537,"Well, but it's relying on Bramblett, which is a decision of this Court, a statutory decision."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2917.537,2919.738,Which we are seeking limitation of--
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2919.738,2920.419,Yes.
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2920.419,2922.85,"--of course, in order to be consistent in our argument."
1994.94-172,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.85,2931.035,"Do you happen to know, counsel, if any of the separate States have enacted and enforced statutes of the kind that we're considering here--"
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2931.035,2931.466,My--
1994.94-172,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2931.466,2933.339,--particularly against lawyers in judicial proceedings?
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2933.339,2946.114,"--My distant recollection in researching the case was that California had a similar case, a similar statute, and there might have been one or two other States, but I found no decisions applying those statutes to the judicial context."
1994.94-172,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.114,2955.853,"So we can say, based on that research, and we can check it out, of course, ourselves, that the States have not found it necessary to police the legal profession by criminal statutes of this kind?"
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2955.853,2956.724,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.183,2960.136,Is your client a member of the legal profession?
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2960.136,2961.896,--No.
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.917,2964.538,Yes.
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2964.538,2973.193,"And... but the same considerations that will apply to the legal professional will apply to the litigants, because it is the statements of the lawyers that are so often--"
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.193,2973.864,"Yes, but--"
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2973.864,2974.665,--factual assertions in court.
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.665,2979.088,"--what we have here is not any statement of any lawyer, but a statement of a litigant."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2979.088,2985.071,"Correct, but we can rest assured that if the Government's interpretation is adopted, it will be extended to misrepresentations made in court--"
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2985.071,2986.473,"Well, why should we rest assured that way?"
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,2988.684,2991.976,--But the Government's reading of 1001 is not limited to litigants.
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.829,3002.513,"And that's true now, even under your theory, in the executive branch."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,3013.98,3019.315,"And if that's a choice that Congress made in drafting the statute, then that's Congress' doing."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.104,3023.206,"Yes, but Bramblett said it wasn't the choice that Congress made."
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,3023.206,3023.606,--And--
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3023.606,3025.4,Bramblett said it goes beyond department.
1994.94-172,2,38128,paul_morris,,3025.4,3042.31,"--Yes, and we, of course, are arguing to the contrary, and the crux of our argument is that at the very least, 1001 raises an ambiguity as to its scope, certainly within the meaning of the term ""department"", and we request reversal of the decision below, based upon resolution of that ambiguity, in favor of the accused."
1994.94-172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3042.31,3044.41,"Thank you, Mr. Morris."
