1999.99-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-478, Charles C. Apprendi, Jr. v. New Jersey."
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,10.272,15.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.368,114.006,"Well, what do you do with the capital sentencing schemes in a State like Arizona, for example, where a person can be convicted of first degree murder and then the judge does the sentencing and is allowed to increase the sentence to a death penalty, set it at death, if it was done for, let's say, pecuniary gain, some factor that the judge determines, and this Court has upheld that kind of a scheme."
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,121.945,145.125,"--I suggest not, Justice O'Connor, because my understanding of the statutes extant is that they... some of them provide for the death penalty, but that's the maximum, so in States such as those... I'm not intimately familiar with Arizona, but it is the States with which I am familiar, those penalties would be within the maximum and call for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury before the judge sentences."
1999.99-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.125,166.307,"But in Arizona the jury simply finds a person guilty of first degree murder and leaves the option of life imprisonment, or death, to the judge, so that clearly the judge is imposing a sentence that was perhaps within the range the jury... but it could just as easily have been life."
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,166.307,168.007,"I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-478,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.329,178.614,"The jury is told and instructed, don't consider the sentence."
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,187.82,189.104,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.66,221.041,"Mr. O'Neill, of course, until our death penalty cases in the 1960's, had not the traditional practice been that a judge in a case where the sentence was up to and including death had the discretion to impose the death penalty or not, or the jury had the discretion to impose it or not?"
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,221.041,222.243,Justice Scalia--
1999.99-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.243,226.512,Wasn't that the traditional rule against which the Sixth Amendment was adopted?
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,226.512,227.145,"--It is, sir."
1999.99-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.145,246.843,"And it was our jurisprudence that created the new factor that you could not impose the death penalty unless there were some special facts which had to be found, either by the judge or by the jury, that would justify it, so this is all a creation of this Court."
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,250.561,252.661,"I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,252.661,257.63,Maybe I can get at the same question that Justice O'Connor and the Chief Justice had in a slightly different way.
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,298.675,302.094,"Justice Breyer, yes, that would constitutional so long as--"
1999.99-478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.094,303.044,How do I draft it?
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,313.384,323.84,"--The sentence... the drafting goes something like this, in crude language, that the maximum penalty for commission of such-and-such crime is 5 years."
1999.99-478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.142,329.342,All right.
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,362.915,368.969,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think that Winship spoke in terms of formalism but prescribed against that, so--"
1999.99-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.969,369.252,Excuse me.
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,382.61,384.829,"--No, I would not concede that, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.262,387.58,"But that's the premise of the question, I thought."
1999.99-478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,387.58,388.18,"Yes, it is."
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,388.18,389.282,"--Well then, I would--"
1999.99-478,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.282,390.365,I didn't think you were--
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,390.365,396.952,"--I would say only, Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer, that there would have to be the constitutional protections of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to a jury."
1999.99-478,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,396.952,401.054,"--Okay, so what you're saying is, I can't... if I'm Congress, I can't--"
1999.99-478,0,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,401.054,401.554,"You can't, under those--"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1674.598,1681.153,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.619,1732.567,"So I suppose that means that the New Jersey legislature could provide for first degree murder is murder with malice aforethought, and could provide the death penalty for that crime, and could leave it up to a judge to decide whether there was malice aforethought, and to decide that just by a preponderance of the evidence?"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1732.567,1735.619,"Respectfully, malice aforethought is not the same as motive."
1999.99-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.113,1780.917,"Traditionally, as I understand the common law, there was no inquiry into motive."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1782.3,1783.017,That's correct.
1999.99-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.017,1783.869,The motive didn't make any difference.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1783.869,1784.835,"That's correct, so malice--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.835,1787.154,What about an espionage prosecution?
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1802.331,1802.997,--If Congress--
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.997,1804.115,--that is hostile to the United States.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1804.115,1812.452,"--If Congress chose to make that motive an element of that particular crime, then yes, that would have to go to the jury."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.452,1816.923,"No, if... Congress... no, I... Congress chooses not to make it an element."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1846.34,1847.308,Under this Court's capital--
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.308,1848.325,That would be okay?
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1848.325,1852.027,"--Under this Court's capital jurisprudence, that would be permissible--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.027,1852.193,Well--
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1852.193,1856.881,--so long as the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the predicate offense.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.349,1865.07,"--That doesn't shock you, that outcome at all?"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1870.724,1874.343,--That's in accord with this Court's jurisprudence on death penalty cases.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.343,1878.128,Death penalty cases are cases apart.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1890.804,1911.032,"Well, respectfully, Your Honor, if a judge can increase a defendant's sentence from life imprisonment to death based on aggravating factors, and that's constitutional under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, then certainly it would be constitutional to increase the petitioner's sentence by a mere 2 years on a noncapital offense."
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.219,1927.227,"No, but the difference is, as Justice Scalia, I guess, has already pointed out, that in the one case the legislature has authorized the death penalty for the facts found by the jury, not in his case."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1927.227,1928.777,"Well, it would be the same thing."
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1932.131,1942.32,"But only... but in his example, if the additional fact is found by a preponderance of the evidence by a judge, and that can make the difference, in your view, between a 10-year sentence and a life sentence."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1942.32,1953.96,"--It may be disproportionate under another constitutional framework, but it's not unconstitutional within this particular framework of the Sixth Amendment that we're dealing with here."
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.012,1973.791,"What if a legislature had a statute that authorized a crime called wrongdoing, just prove anything wrong, and then it had a... and the jury has to find the wrong, but then the judge is directed to impose a whole range of sentences, depending on what the wrong is, and he has to do it just by a preponderance of the evidence."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1975.108,1975.474,--No.
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.116,1990.568,"Well, they could perhaps have a checklist of 95 different things that would qualify as wrongdoing."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,1998.673,2010.814,"Well, we're not suggesting at all that we can take away from the prosecutor's burden to prove mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt, or any of the traditional elements of traditional offenses."
1999.99-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2013.499,2021.439,"Well, what is the constitutional line, in your view, about what can be an element, and what can be a sentencing factor?"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2022.122,2057.945,"--Well, in common law, elements of the offense had to be the mens rea, the actus reis, and the causation, and at least in New Jersey grading provisions are by legislative grace, not by constitutional prerogative, so that you look to the common law, see what the bedrock elements of those particular crimes were, and when the prosecution starts to shift the burden of proof to the defendant, or when the legislature crafts a statute that includes presumptions of guilt, then, of course, we're going too far, but that's--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.945,2059.897,But there were all sorts of mens rea.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2088.48,2111.93,"--The crime to which defendant pleaded guilty is possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and it already has a mens rea element and that is, petitioner's purpose, or conscious objective, was to use the firearm against the person or property of another, and he satisfied that element of the offense when he pleaded guilty and said that he fired his rifle into the house of the Fowlkes family in order to scare them."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.281,2130.207,"And then New Jersey has added an additional mens rea element and it says, if there's this additional one, this additional mental disposition, we're going to give you a higher penalty, but this second one, we're not going to let it go to the jury."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2132.576,2132.959,"--Well, our position--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.959,2133.776,It's still mens rea.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2144.734,2146.836,"--Two answers to that, Your Honor."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.326,2164.464,"And if it makes it an element of defense, its mens rea."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2164.464,2165.83,"No, it's not mens rea."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.83,2166.28,"Oh, it's still a--"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2166.28,2173.82,"It's an additional aggravating factor that, by legislative grace, the legislature has required the prosecution to prove."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.82,2175.203,--Would you call it actus reus?
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2175.203,2176.605,"It's not actus reus, it's--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.605,2178.974,"It's neither actus reus, nor mens rea, it's some--"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2178.974,2180.59,"--Well, even to the extent, if this Court wants--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.59,2182.09,--some third thing that we never heard of before.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2182.09,2194.748,"--If this Court wants... well, Your Honor, in Pointer v. United States back in 1894, I believe it was, this Court held that motive is never an essential element of the crime, and that was murder in that particular case."
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2194.748,2205.954,"Well, it has, but hasn't it also been the case traditionally that motive... and let's just stick to motive for a minute... has never had the significance that it has under the New Jersey statute."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2241.876,2248.597,"There are several types of motive that are used in capital juris... in capital sentencing schemes, including--"
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2248.597,2251.249,"Well, may I interrupt you just... your answer just for a second."
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.189,2264.075,Is that historically true?
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2264.075,2265.425,I've been assuming it is.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2265.425,2272.747,--But under death penalty schemes it can be used to increase the sentence to death.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.747,2274.531,You said traditionally.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2278.485,2278.885,Well--
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.885,2280.968,I don't consider that much of a tradition.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2280.968,2292.942,"--If the tradition is that sentencing judges had wide discretion in a wide range of statutory... or not statutory, but maximum sentences, then certainly motive--"
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2292.942,2301.964,"Within maximum sentences set by the legislature, or, in an earlier day, under common law crimes."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2320.093,2322.276,--I believe that you are.
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.276,2322.459,Okay.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2322.459,2333.401,"But at that point also judges had wide ranges and could impose a sentence up to life imprisonment based on a person's bad motive, just as the same that a judge could give a lesser sentence--"
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2333.401,2344.173,"Well, they had whatever range the legislature specified, but the range did not increase depending on whether there was a finding of motive or not a finding of motive."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2347.51,2353.48,"--Right, and now what the legislature is doing is simply giving greater guidance to sentencing courts in how to--"
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.48,2355.599,"Well, it's doing a lot more than giving guidance."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2357.166,2368.074,--When you look at the New Jersey sentencing code... elements of the offenses and the substantive crimes are found in the first part of the New Jersey Criminal Code.
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2393.605,2396.843,What is... I'm not getting the drift of the argument.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2398.426,2411.067,"--That when defendant was charged with possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, it was not necessarily under the New Jersey code that all he was going to get at the end of this prosecution was a maximum of 10 years."
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2411.067,2412.103,He knows that.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2419.607,2424.493,But there are other facts as well that a sentencing court can take into consideration.
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2425.143,2444.507,"He recognizes that, too, but he says, those facts do not increase the range of permissible sentence from 10 to 20 years, and therefore I accept the fact that under the traditional scheme, which we assume to be constitutional, the judge may find those facts within the range if they are not defined as elements."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2444.507,2456.882,"--In this Court's opinion in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, this Court held that an increase in sentence based on a traditional sentencing factor, there it was recidivism, was constitutionally permissible."
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2456.882,2465.737,"It sure did, and the Court also emphasized about a half-a-dozen times that recidivism was in a unique place in sentencing jurisprudence."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2475.093,2476.545,"Well, of course, it did not have to."
1999.99-478,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2477.711,2483.132,"Well, it didn't have to, but it didn't have to emphasize the uniqueness of recidivism, either."
1999.99-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2494.757,2509.349,"Ms. Gochman, now, in my day as a sentencing judge it was not uncommon to have statutes making a crime, let's say of robbery, punishable for anything from 1 year to life."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2550.343,2550.709,Yes.
1999.99-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.709,2552.542,--for a long time around the country.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2552.542,2552.942,Yes.
1999.99-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2552.942,2565.652,"And what we see today is a series of sentencing schemes that have imposed greater restrictions on the sentencing judge, given them narrower options, is that correct?"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2565.652,2566.752,That's correct.
1999.99-478,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2566.752,2578.376,"And within that, the legislative branch has tried to say, well, if there really is lack of remorse or a bad purpose here, you can increase the sentence."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2579.626,2587.963,"That's correct and, indeed, in this particular instance the defendant has probably been given more due process than was given under a--"
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.963,2588.629,Let me just interrupt you right there.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2588.629,2589.846,--more discretionary scheme.
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.846,2604.656,"If we go back to the general discretion that Justice O'Connor described, and you apply that in this case, it would be permissible for this additional sentence to be imposed on the basis of a report made by the parole officer in the pre... in the post... in the presentence report, wouldn't it?"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2604.656,2607.358,"Not under the New Jersey statute, which requires--"
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.358,2609.292,"No, but I mean, constitutionally it would be permissible."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2620.982,2624.95,--So long as the defendant had the opportunity to rebut that.
1999.99-478,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.95,2629.319,"Well, he didn't even need the opportunity to rebut it in the traditional, old days."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2629.319,2631.902,"Well, we've come very far from there, and--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.902,2635.054,"Well, let me ask this about the traditional old days."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2647.447,2648.831,"--I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.883,2657.151,"Gee, you were very familiar with the traditional scheme when Justice O'Connor described it, and--"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2657.151,2658.187,"--Well, I'm not sure about--"
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.187,2659.753,--all of a sudden it's not clear.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2663.239,2663.672,--Okay.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.672,2673.261,"Now, if the defendant showed enormous remorse, would he be entitled... entitled... to get only 1 year, or only 20, or only 30?"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2675.38,2675.963,That's correct.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.963,2687.086,"If he did the crime, he knew he got life, and if he got any less than life it was a matter of grace and good luck, and if he got a hanging judge, too bad."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2690.071,2690.59,That--
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.59,2692.456,"Now, there are no risks here."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2702.812,2706.597,"--Not if it's a sentencing factor, because it's not a state of mind."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.882,2710.918,You're saying he's not entitled even if--
1999.99-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.918,2712.018,--Let her answer.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.018,2714.803,"She's answering the wrong question, Chief Justice."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2728.444,2728.713,--Yes.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.713,2729.913,"All right, and there was--"
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2729.913,2731.23,But he is... it's not an entitlement.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2739.717,2739.917,--But if--
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2739.917,2740.502,--the same words.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.036,2741.536,--Okay.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2741.536,2742.702,--Or by statute.
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.702,2746.656,And there was no such entitlement under the traditional 1 year to life system.
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2748.423,2753.076,"Well then, we've given defendant more due process than an older system."
1999.99-478,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.076,2761.499,"Well, that's true, but when you give entitlements, what go along with the entitlements are certain requirements, including the requirement of the Sixth Amendment."
1999.99-478,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2761.499,2768.819,"May I ask you, Ms. Gochman, a defendant says, I don't understand this because my buddy committed a crime."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2804.826,2814.634,"The New Jersey supreme court has interpreted the phrase, with a purpose to, in its proper context and that is motive, and this Court is, of course, bound by that court's--"
1999.99-478,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2814.634,2817.336,It's not motive when it appears in the burglary statute?
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2817.336,2831.845,"--It's not the ultimate motive, not at all, in the burglary statute, if a defendant has burglarized a house with a purpose to commit a felony within, but again the prosecution doesn't have to prove why that person wanted to commit the felony."
1999.99-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2877.556,2878.406,"Thank you, Ms. Gochman."
1999.99-478,1,34525,lisa_s_gochman,,2878.406,2878.822,--Thank you.
1999.99-478,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.822,2881.19,"Mr. DuMont, we'll hear from you."
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2881.19,2889.363,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-478,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2979.104,2981.289,"Mr. DuMont, that's just the problem."
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2985.86,2986.377,Yes.
1999.99-478,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2986.377,2991.162,You agree that if it's an enhancement it can go to the judge.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2991.162,2992.514,Yes.
1999.99-478,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2992.514,2993.231,As a sentencing factor.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3008.956,3012.927,"Well, it is a tall order."
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.693,3066.728,What's the criterion for the drawing of the line?
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3090.261,3098.449,"We think tradition and common practice are helpful guides in looking at a particular statute, but no, they don't define a particular line."
1999.99-478,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3167.927,3176.616,Do you think it's a problem for a legislature to say robbery is punishable by anything from a year to life?
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3176.616,3177.066,No.
1999.99-478,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3188.024,3190.309,How about a narrower example?
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3197.613,3202.35,"--On its face, the statute is constitutional."
1999.99-478,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3202.35,3211.623,"Then you basically, in the real world, are saying the legislature is going to determine when there is a jury right and when there isn't."
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3213.473,3224.264,"I think that's correct, and I think that's the way it's always been except for common law crimes, and common law crimes were crimes that were defined by courts, and they were always understood to be at the pleasure of the legislature if the legislature chose to make a different disposition."
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3224.264,3225.897,Why do you say that's the way it's always been?
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3228.215,3230.251,"--Well, take the Federal system."
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.678,3301.097,--Excuse me.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3312.988,3313.821,--It can be written either way.
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.821,3314.805,It can be written--
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3314.805,3323.094,"It can be written either as a mandatory minimum of 20 and then up to 40, or it can be written as, that the range increases to 40 years if somebody was injured, because--"
1999.99-478,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3323.094,3329.098,"--But in any event, even on that answer, he may not impose the higher sentence unless the fact is found."
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3329.098,3329.648,"--That's correct, but what the--"
1999.99-478,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3329.648,3338.103,So there is a limitation on the judge which creates in Justice Scalia's question to your friend a moment ago an entitlement which didn't exist before.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3338.103,3342.488,--But the entitlement is only to have the judge make that determination by a preponderance of the evidence.
1999.99-478,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3342.488,3346.09,"Well, that's a way of defining the problem out of existence."
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3361.884,3371.674,"That is true, but the question you have to face is why you should erect a flat constitutional bar to the legislature making that choice, and that is informed by this analysis, I believe."
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.759,3404.795,So long as you have a reasonable legislature.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3425.292,3427.077,"Justice Scalia, all I can leave you with is--"
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.077,3433.065,"And it seems to me the Constitution should not presume a beneficent, well-meaning legislature."
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3438.552,3439.269,--The Constitution first of all--
1999.99-478,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3439.269,3440.869,From an executive that does not like juries.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3440.869,3463.667,"--What we know is, the Constitution presumes that legislatures act within the constitutional bounds of their power, and there ought to be a high burden on one who suggests that they have not, and our suggestion is that the rule suggested here, although it has an attractive superficial clarity, will cut out a wide variety of appropriate legislative conduct like the conduct here, and there's no justification for doing that in order to prevent the outlier case."
1999.99-478,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3468.988,3469.738,But why isn't this an outlier case?
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3469.738,3471.338,Maybe it will.
1999.99-478,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3471.338,3473.273,Why isn't this an outlier case?
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3476.058,3483.479,"It's not an outlier case because all New Jersey did was to decide that something bad, particularly bad purpose which is traditional--"
1999.99-478,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.479,3484.581,Ups the sentence by 10 years.
1999.99-478,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3484.581,3485.348,--Thank you.
1999.99-478,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.348,3489.116,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1999.99-478,3,32272,joseph_d_oneill,,3491.734,3509.029,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would like, unless the Court has additional questions, to limit my rebuttal to a question posed by Justice Thomas concerning the distinction between element of a crime and a sentencing factor."
1999.99-478,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3559.795,3563.795,"Thank you, Mr. O'Neill. The case is submitted."
