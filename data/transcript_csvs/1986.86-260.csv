1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We will hear arguments next in South Dakota against Elizabeth H. Dole, Secretary, United States Department of Transportation."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,68.66,81.635,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether or not Congress may condition the receipt of highway funds upon a state having in effect the 21-year-old drinking age."
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.218,139.574,"General Tellinghuisen, would you explain whether you think this case might be moot now?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,143.776,145.227,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.689,168.343,"So it still has a year or so to run, a year to run?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,168.343,169.01,That's correct.
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.01,170.36,Under the old system.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,170.36,171.545,Yes.
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.699,183.02,"And there are Federal funds at issue, so it is saved from mootness."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,183.02,184.602,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,184.602,190.773,Then am I not correct the statute doesn't go into effect at all if you prevail here?
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,190.773,192.458,That's correct.
1986.86-260,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.205,216.674,We know how to do things out in the upper midwest.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,216.674,220.276,That's correct.
1986.86-260,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,483.08,486.049,"Of course, South Dakota can still continue to do that, can't it?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,486.049,487.734,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.398,512.933,"You can finish your answer at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Tellinghuisen."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,512.933,522.491,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.491,538.334,"Please proceed, Mr. Tellinghuisen."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,538.334,558.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in direct response to Justice Blackmun's question concerning the ability of the states to still have a choice even in the face of Section 158, I would submit to the Court that that is erroneous or that assumption is in error for two reasons."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.957,633.045,"Well, Mr. Tellinghuisen, you think the Twenty-First Amendment went further than just to deal with the commerce power of Congress then?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,633.045,665.85,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, and I rely on this Court's decisions in addressing the Twenty-First Amendment when this Court has said that the Twenty-First Amendment, while it is transparently clear that it operated as a limitation upon the commerce clause, it equally recognized that the Twenty-First Amendment gave to the states broad powers to regulate in the area of the times or places or even the sale of liquor, in other words, the liquor distribution system within that state."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.85,673.289,"Well, don't you think they would have had that just under traditional reserve power of states?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,673.289,676.241,"Well, I would certainly maintain that, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.831,724.738,"And here you say that because Congress is cutting off 5 percent of South Dakota's highway fund money, South Dakota is not able to do what it wants?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,724.738,743.886,"That's correct, and I am suggesting... what I am suggesting to the Court is that the presentation of the choice irrespective of the amount of money involved is what... is the impermissible derogation of the state's powers under the Twenty-First Amendment."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.886,751.89,"There are a lot of cases that have sustained the Congress's spending power, Steward Machine Company, a long line of cases."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,751.89,752.741,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,773.921,785.213,You mean provided we gave the Twenty-First Amendment the broader preemption that you would argue should be given.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,796.334,825.771,"--I would say, Your Honor, that if the Court were to find that the operation of the Twenty-First Amendment only prevented Congress from interfering with a state's right to allow into the state the importation of alcohol, that certainly would put us in a more difficult position, but that is not what this Court has recognized in, for instance, Capital Cities Cable versus Crisp."
1986.86-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.219,899.719,It didn't say that.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,902.171,902.588,I'm sorry.
1986.86-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.588,905.973,That is not quite what the quote you read said.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,927.155,928.771,"Your Honor, what I would also--"
1986.86-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.771,931.023,This has nothing to do with the distribution system.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,931.023,932.657,"--Well, in effect it does, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.937,955.573,"You think the setting of... well, all right."
1986.86-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.573,973.284,"You are going to be arguing later when you address the scope of the Federal Government's commerce power that one can't stretch things to infinity, and it seems to me you are arguing a very broad notion of what importation includes and distribution includes."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,977.171,988.544,"Yes, I would argue that, and in part our reliance, Your Honor, is based upon this Court's decision in New York State Liquor Authority versus Balianca, where the Court stated,"
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.405,1013.494,You think the Federal Government could keep you from selling liquor to a certain defined group of people like Indians?
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1013.494,1015.077,"--No, I don't believe they could, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.467,1024.217,Like the Indians.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1024.785,1026.618,"I would say that, no, it could not."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.618,1035.025,And so therefore using the spending power for that purpose is just as illegal.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1036.377,1038.527,I would suggest that that is the case.
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.527,1039.661,Under the Twenty-First Amendment.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1039.661,1043.963,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.873,1073.566,"Well, do you think the Federal Government could keep you from... a state-operated liquor store, for example, selling on military reservations?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1073.566,1086.392,"--I think this Court's holdings, for instance, in the Collins v. Yosemite... Yosemite... excuse me... case would suggest just that, and I don't have a problem with that."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.392,1096.331,But you think they couldn't... the Federal Government couldn't keep... couldn't forbid sales to servicemen off the base?
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1096.331,1099.533,"Yes, I would maintain that."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.998,1126.684,xxx for Federal money.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1126.684,1128.686,I would concede that.
1986.86-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.531,1150.383,"Mr. Attorney General, could I go... I want to be sure I understood your answer correctly."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.444,1169.463,That's what you said.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1173.081,1173.481,"Well, okay."
1986.86-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.481,1175.45,And I was going to... Let me give you another one that is similar.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1189.041,1194.079,Are we assuming that Congress is going to condition the receipt of money on--
1986.86-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.079,1206.219,"No, just say flatly, it is against a Federal statute enacted for the purpose of protecting safety on the highways to sell liquor to any uniformed driver of a truck or a bus."
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1206.219,1208.004,--I would submit that it would be unlawful.
1986.86-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.004,1208.738,It would be unconstitutional?
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1208.738,1215.842,"Yes, because again, Your Honor, it goes to the every heart of the Twenty-First Amendment."
1986.86-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.842,1218.36,And you would have to say the same about the soldier.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1218.36,1219.729,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.729,1223.264,"If you lose on that, you lose on the one in the case you are arguing?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1223.264,1228.585,"No, I don't believe so, because our case that we are arguing is much more narrowly defined."
1986.86-260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.021,1261.639,Let me take it one step further.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1266.627,1270.162,"I would have to steadfastly maintain that they could not, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.162,1270.729,You are consistent.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1277.916,1281.035,"I am not going to go so far as to say that, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.896,1305.252,I thought you were arguing that these conditions on receipt of Federal money were invalid in themselves.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1305.252,1305.968,I am arguing--
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.968,1308.37,Wholly aside from the Twenty-First Amendment.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1309.237,1310.12,"--No, I don't."
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1320.178,1340.073,"Well, do you disavow the argument then submitted by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their amicus brief to the effect that there has to be a substantial relationship between the condition imposed on a grant and the spending of Federal money?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1340.073,1346.829,"Your Honor, I am not in a position to suggest to this Court that I disagree with that proposition."
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1346.829,1347.929,"Well, you certainly are."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.781,1352.149,You just did a while ago.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1352.149,1360.839,What I am suggesting is that I am not prepared to address that issue in light of the fact that we have the Twenty-First Amendment.
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1361.839,1366.556,"What if you lose on that, and this Court is having to grapple with it?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1369.492,1380.983,"--It is from the standpoint that Congress's power under the commerce clause is not without limitations, as this Court has noted, for instance, in Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School District."
1986.86-260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.297,1401.114,That is the same argument.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1405.7,1427.031,"--The argument that is made in the amicus brief is one that the purpose for which the condition is attached is not proper, and I guess I would just have to maintain that I am not prepared to argue that particular fine point at this time because we are not dealing outside the scope of the Twenty-First Amendment."
1986.86-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1427.031,1437.672,"xxx suggest then, Mr. Attorney General, that the Tenth Amendment at least is not as much of an inhibitor on Federal regulation as would be the Twenty-First?"
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1437.672,1441.641,I think that would certainly be in keeping with this Court's prior decisions.
1986.86-260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.641,1444.159,And that is your position?
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1444.159,1448.96,"It may not be a position that I like to advocate, but it is certainly one that I recognize."
1986.86-260,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.96,1454.181,It sounds like if you lost on the Twenty-First then you would a fortiori lose on the Tenth.
1986.86-260,0,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,1454.181,1466.089,"Well, I guess I can sum it up, Your Honor, by just suggesting that if we lose on the Twenty-First Amendment I recognize we are in trouble on the Tenth Amendment."
1986.86-260,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.476,1472.443,"Thank you, Mr. Tellinghuisen."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1479.999,1485.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I propose to argue two points."
1986.86-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1592.755,1599.176,"Do you think that Congress could bring back prohibition under your view, under the spending power?"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1599.176,1604.897,I don't think that Section 2 answers that question.
1986.86-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.855,1643.438,That was before the Twenty-First Amendment.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1643.438,1689.335,"Yes, it was, but it seems to me that if you take the Twenty-First Amendment in its two parts, the passage and later repeal of Prohibition didn't change that, and it seems to me that the plain words of Section 2 don't change that either, because if the Congress were today... I don't suggest that it is politically likely... to adopt the statute that was envisioned in Clark Distilling, that statute would not involve any transportation, importation, delivery, or use of alcoholic beverages in violation of state law and therefore would not be prohibited by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment."
1986.86-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.335,1692.037,What if you take the converse of that situation?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1709.416,1721.122,I am drawing a distinction between a prohibition and a protection at transactions in alcoholic beverages that it seems to me Section 2 draws.
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.041,1754.861,"You are using the word ""may"" and it sounds as though that sort of requires a little construction of the amendment, too, doesn't it?"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1756.647,1760.599,"--Well, I am not trying to make just a wooden plain language argument."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.859,1809.781,How does that tie in with this case?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1809.781,1828.909,"--In this case what Congress has done is to pass a statute which encourages the state to prohibit alcoholic beverage transactions that the state chooses not to prohibit, sales to 19 and 20-year-olds."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.972,1903.724,Is 324 Liquor Corporation consistent with that view?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1903.724,1905.076,--I think so.
1986.86-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.663,1968.75,"So, I mean, you think the states have no power derived from the Twenty-First Amendment to set limits on the age of drinking at all."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1968.75,1971.686,"No, that is not what I am saying."
1986.86-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1980.641,1982.659,Power under the... derived from the Twenty-First Amendment.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1982.659,1984.278,I don't think the states' power--
1986.86-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1984.278,1984.978,--to set drinking ages.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1984.978,1996.019,"--I don't think the states' power derives from the Twenty-First Amendment at all, but I think the states' power is protected by the Twenty-First Amendment in one direction--"
1986.86-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.019,1999.971,Do you think that might come as a little bit of a surprise to the drafters of the Twenty-First Amendment?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1999.971,2030.24,"--No, because Congress and this Court promptly demonstrated their understanding that the Twenty-First Amendment was not intended to restrict the otherwise valid exercise of Congressional power to impose burdens on or additional restrictions on alcoholic beverage transactions in ways that do not require a violation of state law."
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.507,2158.109,xxx need to have a different law.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2158.509,2159.759,--Yes.
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.077,2171.25,"Mr. Cohen, apart from whether it can contravene the state law, where does Congress get the power to do this?"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2171.25,2180.355,"Congress gets the power, I think, under the spending clause, and our only claim is that they have the power under the spending clause."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.355,2197.734,What is the the spending clause case that you think is closest to this one in the relationship between the purpose of the expenditure and the condition that is imposed upon receipt of the funds?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2202.738,2214.862,"Let me interject, because I want to, that I think that the... I think that that question is not before the Court, and I want at least to note that, although I am going to respond, I am going to respond to the question."
1986.86-260,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2321.965,2330.737,Is there some limit then on Congress spending power of a requirement of germaneness or relatedness?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2342.311,2359.923,"The answer is that the Court has frequently said there is some kind of a limit attached to the spending power, and to my knowledge has never said what that limit is."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.802,2378.868,Germane to what?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2403.952,2431.436,"I will give you Lau against Nichols, where the Court... where Congress says the recipient of any Federal grant has got to comply with the civil rights laws, and that ends up being interpreted to mean that the city of San Francisco must provide some means for educating its Chinese-speaking children."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.436,2434.821,--But Congress has independent powers to enact civil rights laws.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2440.042,2441.91,I am not sure that it has an independent power.
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.325,2493.36,But that has to do with the efficient expenditure of the funds.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2505.117,2509.721,--I don't think that the connection is close.
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.923,2514.79,I don't even think there is a close one.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2514.79,2531.052,"--to this case, of course, but in Civil Service Commission the Court pointed out that the United States has no power to regulate the local political activities as such of state officials."
1986.86-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.969,2562.606,"When you speak of the word ""germane"", how is that being used as a term?"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2567.075,2607.135,"What I am suggesting and this is, I think, not a particularly well developed area of our jurisprudence, because the Court has never, I think, had occasion to strike down a condition, but what I am suggesting is that the condition must be germane, and I guess I mean within the necessary and proper penumbra of the... germane to the purpose for which the Federal funds are being expended, and I am suggesting--"
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.135,2629.648,"Let me, since you can spend federal funds for any purpose that involves the general welfare, that expands the Federal powers into anything at all so long as you... the Federal Government can spend money for art and suddenly it can begin conditioning those grants to get the states to do things in the field of art that it would have no independent power to achieve."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2629.648,2665.405,"--It is certainly correct that the Federal Government can spend money for art and that it can... and does, and that it can do that in order... in order, among other things, to get the states to do things that it would have no independent power to achieve, such as by requiring matching grants, such as by requiring that money provided for art be apportioned so that members of minorities or handicapped people or whatever get a share of that money."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.405,2667.506,That relates to the expenditure of the money.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2675.029,2675.796,"Yes, it is."
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.943,2730.347,"Mr. Cohen, as I understand your argument, you would agree, would you not, that they could not attach an unconstitutional condition to the acceptance of the grant?"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2738.437,2739.47,"Oh, certainly."
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.47,2740.655,Or only Republican xxx.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2740.655,2742.122,"Oh, certainly."
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.122,2747.725,"So there is a limit to the expenditure grant based on whether the condition would be otherwise illegal, I suppose."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2747.725,2748.375,There is.
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.375,2753.279,"So if this condition should violate the Twenty-First Amendment, you might be in trouble."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2753.279,2767.206,"I would agree that there are other Constitutional restrictions, and that if the Twenty-First Amendment is thought to bar this--"
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.206,2780.614,"For example, if the condition in this grant were to a state that had Prohibition, they say, we will give you the money provided you repeal your Prohibition law, I think you would probably say that was invalid."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2780.614,2783.382,"--Well, first, I think that doing that, that is, moving--"
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.382,2783.799,For two reasons.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2794.539,2795.406,--I guess I don't--
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.406,2796.458,Do you get my hypothetical?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2811.183,2812.349,--I would agree that that one--
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.349,2813.033,--your argument at least would prohibit that.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2813.033,2818.037,--I would agree that that creates... raises a Twenty-First Amendment question.
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.707,2825.041,I understand.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2833.129,2837.45,"If you say it doesn't violate it, yes, then you have an issue."
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.7,2842.068,"--Which would violate it if it were a direct statute, is what I am saying."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2842.068,2842.402,--Okay.
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.912,2855.445,Why not.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2869.002,2891.668,--It seems to me that all of this Court's cases holding that powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment may be waived by the state if it chooses to comply with the condition and that a condition that may encourage a state not to exercise a power that it had under the Tenth Amendment is--
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.668,2892.185,You are switching to the Tenth Amendment.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2919.937,2944.553,"--I am suggesting that there is a difference between the protection of individual rights, as I think you have eloquently suggested on occasion, between the protection of individual rights from being bargained away by conditional state--"
1986.86-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.553,2948.188,I have suggested that in cases where the Court has said there is no hierarchy of constitutional values.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2952.075,2971.887,"--The Twenty-First Amendment protects primarily against the operation of other clauses of the Constitution, the state's power which it otherwise would have given up under the commerce clause and so forth, to restrict transactions in alcoholic beverages."
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.793,3013.714,You could even condition the grant on every state that adopts a unicameral legislature.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3028.04,3032.277,I would hope that the Court would find a way to say that that one wasn't germane.
1986.86-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.277,3035.995,"Me, too."
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3041.233,3085.678,"I think that there is in the germaneness test the possibility of saying, look, a very large and very central state interest can't be germane to a very small Federal interest, but in the Lead-Deadwood case, the Court did at least observe that it appeared to be constitutional for Congress to grant money on the condition that a state let the county that was the recipient of that money decide how to spend it for any governmental purpose."
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.826,3145.383,What is the source of the government's power to put the 65... to put the recently gone 65-mile-an-hour speed limit... 55?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3145.383,3152.22,"--Well, that is also a condition attached to the grant of Federal funds for highway construction."
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.22,3159.993,"Do you think the Federal Government had power directly to put that speed limit on, on the interstate highway system?"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3159.993,3160.71,It might.
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.547,3173.884,You don't argue that the government directly could say no one who is using alcohol could drive on the interstate highways?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3173.884,3180.39,"No, we don't argue that the government could directly say that each state must adopt a minimum drinking age--"
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.39,3181.224,"No, no, they just have a national--"
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3181.224,3182.174,--and that is what the government did do.
1986.86-260,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.174,3192.031,--They just have a national... no drunk driving law related to interstate highways.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3192.031,3202.153,"I would think that some power to police interstate highways is probably implicit in the commerce clause, yes."

1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3222.717,3230.156,I would have thought that should Congress choose to do so the Court would sustain that as a valid exercise of the commerce clause.
1986.86-260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3230.156,3232.622,You say you would not have thought it?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3232.622,3233.108,I'm sorry?
1986.86-260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3233.108,3235.224,You would not think Congress had the power to do that?
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3235.224,3236.143,"No, I would."
1986.86-260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3236.143,3237.143,You would think so.
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3237.143,3239.928,I would think the Court would sustain that as an exercise of the commerce--
1986.86-260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3239.928,3244.047,Congress would have the same safety interest that you--
1986.86-260,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3256.724,3266.912,--Let me finish by saying I think President Reagan was right in this case when he said that Section 158 is a judicious use of Federal power.
1986.86-260,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.922,3281.789,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3291.111,3311.541,"I would like to take up where Mr. Cohen has just left off, and that is the Federal interest that has been in essence the cornerstone of this regulation or this condition that the Congress has imposed under Section 158."
1986.86-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.089,3365.743,How can you say that allowing drinking up to the age of 21 is stricter than allowing it up to the age... I mean up to the age of 19 is stricter than allowing it up to 21?
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3365.743,3366.761,"--I am sorry, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.761,3372.765,"You say you are enforcing stricter laws, but as I understand it you are trying to defend a law that is less strict."
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3372.765,3373.249,That is true.
1986.86-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.249,3375.217,It allows drinking by people under 21.
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3376.701,3378.586,That is absolutely true.
1986.86-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.618,3404.32,--What do you make out of that?
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3404.32,3414.009,"--Well, I just... I wanted to throw that out more for informational purposes than for... I just want to suggest that we recognize the special place--"
1986.86-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.009,3420.846,It is still less strict to allow you to drink 3.2 beer at age 20 than to allow you to drink no alcohol at age 20.
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3420.846,3439.641,"--That's correct, and the point I was going to make is that that underscores, however, South Dakota's attempt, or a recognition of not only a problem but making a sincere attempt at addressing that problem in a way that is different from the other states."
1986.86-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.401,3459.555,xxx people who drink 3.2 beer are unaffected by it.
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3459.555,3461.121,"--Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor."
1986.86-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.121,3479.866,And that under your law it may well be that there will be more young people on the roads who have been drinking and affected by it than would be the case if no one could drink until he is 21.
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3479.866,3481.551,I would say that the incidence--
1986.86-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3481.551,3482.268,Isn't that right?
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3482.268,3487.288,"--Well, that is one analysis that could be made, and in fact that is the analysis that--"
1986.86-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.288,3489.121,"Well, is there something wrong with it?"
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3489.121,3500.512,"--Well, I just want to clarify, Your Honor, that there are parts of that assumption that don't necessarily follow, and there are other parts of it that are left outside of the consideration."
1986.86-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.979,3518.49,You don't think that even... there might even under your law as compared with what the Federal Government wants to achieve that there wouldn't at least be ten drivers a year on the road who had been drinking?
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3518.49,3524.127,"--Your Honor, given my experience as a state's attorney, I can assure you that there will probably be more than ten."
1986.86-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.127,3526.829,"Yes, so the answer to my previous question is yes."
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3526.829,3552.028,"Yes, but what I would like to point out, Your Honor, is that if we impose a 21 drinking age in South Dakota, we could equally find that we are driving 18, 19, and 20-year-olds out into the countryside to consume alcoholic beverages, not only restricted to 3.2 beer, and that in and of itself puts them behind the wheel of a car."
1986.86-260,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3558.55,3565.304,"Well, are we to decide this case on whether 19 or 21 years is the proper age?"

1986.86-260,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3567.156,3568.74,We are not going to decide on that?
1986.86-260,2,40647,roger_a_tellinghuisen,,3568.74,3571.042,"No, no."
1986.86-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3586.452,3592.705,May I give you one other hypothetical I have been thinking about in view of your reliance on the states' power under the Twenty-First Amendment?
