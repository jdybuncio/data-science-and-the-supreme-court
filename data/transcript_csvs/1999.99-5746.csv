1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.168,"We'll hear argument now in No. 99-5746, Lonnie Weeks v. Ronald J. Angelone."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,10.372,13.355,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.187,82.421,"The instruction you're talking about was upheld in Buchanan, was it not?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,82.421,85.606,The instruction in the context of Buchanan was upheld.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.606,87.481,It was upheld across the board I think.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,89.293,105.647,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, as I read Buchanan, there is a footnote 4 in which you write that the instruction which would be unconstitutional would be a strained... s-t-r-a-i-n-e-d... strained construction of the statute."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.202,126.45,"But the... the qualification is were we to entertain any doubt, which is a subjunctive."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,131.23,137.415,"Well, my reading of the case is... is the same as your reading of the case, that there was an application of Boyde."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.985,158.172,"Well, how broad a rule are... are you asking for here?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,161.56,166.355,The rule in this case we feel is compelled... we're not seeking a rule.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.681,184.567,And is it that whenever the jury asks... sends a note to the judge asking a question that the judge can't refer them to an instruction; he has to respond directly to the question?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,184.567,185.721,Not at all.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.018,188.174,Then how... how do you differ that?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,188.174,195.797,"--Well, here you have a question which illustrates that the jurors are poised to violate Lockett and Eddings."
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.23,213.744,"Well, I think that may be reading more into the question than is justified."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,246.12,253.712,"It... it occurs not infrequently, primarily in non-capital cases, and it may, in fact, occur in some capital cases."
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.928,271.05,"Do we... do we also look at the surrounding circumstances, the arguments of both counsel and any other instructions that are included in the packet?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,271.05,285.716,"I think that once the jury or the sentencer comes out and illustrates what they're thinking, then the surrounding circumstances, which are so important in a Boyde context when you're trying to figure out what they might have been thinking, carries less weight."
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.605,288.902,But it may carry some weight.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,309.941,319.951,--And... and the sentencing judge in Eddings had a statute... and we presume he understood it... that said any circumstances can be admitted and any circumstances could be considered.
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.176,347.378,"Mr. Olive, you--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,347.378,350.298,"A reasonable argument could be made here... yes, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.298,357.686,"--You argue as though the... the judge did not give the jury any help at all when they asked this question, but that's not the case."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,409.151,414.726,It's the only paragraph in the... the instructions that would have created the question.
1999.99-5746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.804,453.523,But even... even with--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,453.523,454.069,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-5746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.069,460.847,"--Even with laymen who are seeking advice of counsel, it's a common occurrence for them to phone counsel with a question and say, it's in the contract."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,471.389,474.592,"Well, a contract is a great example."
1999.99-5746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.902,487.793,Suppose the--
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.793,488.932,--And what was that instruction?
1999.99-5746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.932,490.603,Suppose the judge had... if I can just... one follow-up.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,500.036,502.083,--That is--
1999.99-5746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.083,503.034,Suppose he had said that.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,503.034,512.984,"--The... the fact that the jurors came back two or three times, which Justice Scalia referred to, to me cuts in the petitioner's favor."
1999.99-5746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.984,519.996,Suppose the judge gave the comment at the end of his... of... of his answer that I've... that I've hypothesized.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,519.996,523.9,"Well, say he did it in this case and in the context of this case."
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.22,545.72,"No, but they didn't--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,545.72,546.658,--I came out of the jury room.
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,546.658,547.204,--But they didn't say that.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,559.512,561.355,Incomprehensible?
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.7,564.106,What was ambiguous about it?
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.106,564.574,Ambiguous?
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,565.215,566.449,--What page are we on?
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.668,572.729,--I frankly find it hard to see how you could have said it more clearly if he had tried to reformulate it in some other way.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,572.729,589.986,"Well, the ambiguity would be the ambiguity recognized by the dissenters in Buchanan, is that if you find an aggravating circumstance, what you must do is impose the death penalty or... and then the rest of the phrase... to where if you... if you haven't found an aggravating circumstance, then you shall not--"
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.986,590.939,That's not what it says.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,590.939,591.673,--which... which didn't--
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.673,592.282,That's not what it says.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,595.921,596.796,--With the--
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.796,599.342,--then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,599.342,605.106,"--With the ambiguity being parenthetically, i.e., that there is no aggravating circumstance found beyond a reasonable doubt."
1999.99-5746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.106,616.82,"Mr. Olive, the pattern instructions have been changed since the one the Court inspected in Angelone, and they are clearer now on the point that... that you're raising."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,627.989,630.769,I can only speculate.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,647.152,648.808,I thought that the... sorry.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,649.291,649.728,Yes.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,649.728,653.086,I thought the ambiguity was with the word justified.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,653.086,654.368,Correct.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,654.368,674.704,"I mean, I thought it read if you find the commonwealth has proved aggravators beyond a reasonable doubt, then you may fix the punishment at death, or if you believe, from all the evidence, the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment at life."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,685.699,686.355,Which is a--
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.355,691.042,"Of course, a lawyer may know that the word justified refers to mitigators, which word never appears."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,691.042,695.774,--That... after the word justified come in the parenthetical.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.288,707.236,"That seems to me really a re-argument of Buchanan, and I thought this Court in Buchanan had said that instruction was... was proper."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,707.236,708.471,What the--
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.471,715.11,"And I... I really think I'm hearing you suggest that we should adopt the view of the dissenters in Buchanan, and--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,715.11,716.483,"--No, I am not--"
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.483,718.327,--that would be difficult for us to do I--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,718.327,719.81,--I'm not asking that.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.428,750.673,"--No, but it did announce... it did announce that this instruction was sufficiently clear to be under the Constitution."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,750.673,759.529,"--That... I think that that's... and what we're arguing is that an application in particular cases, it would nevertheless not be constitutional."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.623,774.523,"Well, you're... you're saying then that even though an instruction is perfectly sound, the Constitution requires that if a jury... juror asks a question, the trial judge has to do something more than simply refer them to the instruction."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,776.445,779.303,"--Under some circumstances, it is not extraordinary."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.69,790.253,"Well, do... do--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,790.253,791.392,And Skipper is another example.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.392,805.574,--Do you have any authority for the proposition that the Constitution will require a judge to answer a juror's question by something other than a referral back to an instruction?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,807.651,815.007,I think that the... the cases holding that either implicitly or expressly are Penry and--
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.007,815.929,Was that... was that--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,815.929,816.46,--and Simmons.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.46,817.585,--Was that a jury question?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,817.585,817.913,No.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.803,834.703,"Well, I... I'm asking you do you have a case from this Court in which the Court held it was constitutionally required when a... a good instruction was given, but a juror asked a question, that the judge could not simply refer them to the instruction."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,834.703,835.234,I do not.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.415,853.009,But how does it--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,853.009,855.523,And additional... additional instructions had to be given.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,855.523,861.348,--Four members of the Court thought it was... you were right on it being ambiguous on itself.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,862.254,862.942,Buchanan?
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.942,863.145,--Yes.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,863.145,863.801,In Buchanan.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.801,864.395,Five didn't.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,881.185,881.904,No.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.904,883.31,That couldn't be the rule of law.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,883.31,884.386,But you can have a--
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.386,893.352,"Therefore, this case, if you're going to win it, must have a clear factor about it that makes this special and what is it?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,893.352,899.724,--The clear factor about it that makes this special is that these sentencers were like the sentencer in Eddings.
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.923,929.369,"If... if the statute is, as you say, ambiguous, why would you think that some other jury that didn't ask a question was simply wrong in picking the wrong... the wrong choice of the ambiguity?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,940.912,948.503,--But the Court in Buchanan stated that an interpretation like this would be a strained interpretation.
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.451,960.013,Is there--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,960.013,961.591,--to correct that strained interpretation.
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.591,967.901,--Is there some principle that a person who is taking a strained interpretation will normally ask a question?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,967.901,969.259,"No, there isn't."
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.259,971.68,It... it seems to me that's essential to your argument.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,971.68,972.899,"No, there isn't, but when a court--"
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.899,977.631,"Well, if that's... if that's the case, then the fact that they... that they asked a question makes no difference."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,988.644,993.953,--It alerts the court that the jury or sentencer is poised to violate the Eighth Amendment.
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.953,994.657,It doesn't... it doesn't--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,994.657,995.391,If they come back.
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.391,1005.824,--alert the court unless you... unless you somehow sustain the principle that a person who is likely to take a strained interpretation is also likely to ask a question.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1007.137,1024.739,"You know, it's... it is only in the cases where the jury comes back and asks the question that I think that you can feel comfortable, especially under the circumstances of this case where they highlight and underline and tell you what they've been thinking, that they have interpreted the sentencing instruction in a way that could violate Lockett."
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1046.105,1051.197,"Mr. Olive, what... what do you make of... of this portion of the... the facts here?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1128.947,1132.727,There's something in this record that I've never seen before.
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1161.277,1166.634,That is... I... I don't see how that can possibly get us beyond pure speculation.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1212.99,1216.302,And the other position would be pure speculation.
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1220.754,1227.595,"No, but your... the... the burden of your argument is to... is to indicate to us that there is the risk that you claim."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1227.595,1228.283,--Correct.
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.283,1233.046,And I don't see anything more than a speculative basis for your argument.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1233.046,1234.093,"Well, referring the--"
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1234.093,1239.357,"May... may I, however, go back to my question, which has sort of dropped out of our dialogue here?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1279.06,1279.763,--No.
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.177,1297.662,"Well, no, but it wasn't just follow the instructions."
1999.99-5746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.688,1314.654,That's the instruction that gave rise to the question.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1314.654,1316.543,--The instruction... the instruction gave rise to the question.
1999.99-5746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.543,1318.121,"If there ever was a circular argument, that's it."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1318.121,1322.635,And the... the question supposes that repetition equals clarity for these jurors--
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1322.635,1323.869,"Well, sometimes--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1323.869,1326.352,--and that's... that's an inference that we can't draw as well because I think that--
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1326.352,1334.349,"--Sometimes in reading briefs, I find that reading a paragraph a second time helps me, and I understand it the second time when I didn't the first time."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1343.908,1348.344,--That's why I've tried to set the table with these jurors did that.
1999.99-5746,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1385.954,1412.678,"Is your point... is your point... I don't want to put words in your mouth, though I suppose I will be, but I mean, if their confusion is they do not know if the two words, not justified, refer to absence of aggravators or presence of mitigators, if that's their confusion, I guess reading those two words, not justified, 10 million times will not clear up the confusion."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1412.678,1414.317,Well put.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1416.644,1431.92,"Mr.... Mr. Olive, is this a case controlled by AEDPA, the... the new statute dealing with post-conviction relief?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1431.92,1435.575,There have been arguments made that 2254(d) applies.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1441.23,1442.839,What is your position?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1442.839,1443.401,--That--
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1443.401,1444.431,Is it or not?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1444.431,1449.117,--That the standard of review under 2254(d) ought not to apply in this case.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.117,1449.774,Why?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1449.774,1469.624,"And the reason that it ought not to apply in this case is because 2254 and... and all of A-E-D-P-A, or AEDPA, has as it's policy concern or... or recognition that State courts that grapple with Federal constitutional issues ought to be rewarded or certainly not punished for their good faith efforts to enforce the Federal Constitution by looking at the legal landscape and applying the law."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.273,1504.296,"I'm surprised you call it a summary denial because the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote an opinion dealing with all sorts of issues at some length, and they said this issue simply was... was barely averted to and no supporting authority."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1508.686,1511.998,It said just denied and that's what I mean by summary--
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.998,1512.793,Are you talking about the--
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1512.793,1521.51,"--On these... on these claims, the State court simply said we find no merit and denied and didn't state the legal basis for it and didn't give us what the legal landscape was."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.51,1526.07,"--Well, but it said that the... that the claims were simply stated and not argued, didn't it?"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1526.07,1536.472,"It said that these so-called arguments we reject, and in the brief the so-called arguments were our reference to Penry and to Woodson and to Brown."
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1542.283,1546.921,"Well, if section 2254(d)(1) is applicable--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1546.921,1547.515,Yes.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1547.515,1559.76,"--then we would have to say and determine here that the Virginia Supreme Court, in denying the claim, rendered a decision that was contrary to--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1559.76,1560.087,Correct.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1560.087,1566.601,--or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law as determined by this Court.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1566.601,1567.32,Correct.
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.32,1583.142,And I'm troubled by that because I don't know of any case where we have articulated anything about a duty to instruct in different terms rather than call a jury's attention to an instruction the court believes covers it.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1583.142,1583.969,Our--
1999.99-5746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.969,1590.966,"So, I... I don't see how we're... if... if AEDPA applies, I don't see how you can meet the standard."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1590.966,1599.306,--Our argument is that Penry recognized that the Eddings rule applied to juries as of 1986.
1999.99-5746,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.987,1623.609,"Mr. Olive, you may have adverted to this earlier and I may not have been paying attention when you did."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1650.41,1651.629,I believe I would.
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.506,1689.866,That's a Ninth Circuit case?
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1689.866,1690.397,Correct.
1999.99-5746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1691.615,1706.812,"Mr. Olive, I thought in response to the 2254(d) that you were relying on Boyde to say that if the jury misunderstood to the extent that it wasn't going to take mitigating factors into account--"
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1706.812,1707.5,Right.
1999.99-5746,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1707.5,1712.871,--then that would be reversible... cause for reversal.
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1712.871,1718.526,"Well, Penry I think involves a Boyde analysis as well, if I'm not mistaken."
1999.99-5746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.89,1776.658,"I guess if we adopted your position, States would have to have two form instructions because if you say just repeating the form instruction is not enough, you'd either leave it to the judge to do a seat-of-the-pants reformulation of the... of the standard State instruction or you... you would have to have a second... a second alternative prescribed as a form instruction."
1999.99-5746,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1786.888,1794.448,"In... in Eddings, this Court didn't remand the case back to the trial court and say read the statute, just read the statute."
1999.99-5746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.088,1799.57,"Thank you, Mr. Olive."
1999.99-5746,1,38551,robert_h_anderson_iii,,1802.398,1808.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"

1999.99-5746,1,38551,robert_h_anderson_iii,,1992.118,1992.868,"--Well, I'm--"
1999.99-5746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.868,1994.492,That's why they asked the question.
1999.99-5746,1,38551,robert_h_anderson_iii,,1994.492,1998.554,"--No, I don't... I don't agree that that's why they... they asked the question."
1999.99-5746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1998.554,2004.176,"Well, the question certainly would be the question that one reading the dissent would expect a jury to ask--"
1999.99-5746,1,38551,robert_h_anderson_iii,,2004.176,2005.082,"Well, it's... it's--"
1999.99-5746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.082,2008.034,"--if one thought the dissent was right, which I happen to, of course."
