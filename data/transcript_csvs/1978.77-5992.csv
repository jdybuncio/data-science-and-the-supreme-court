1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.836,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Addington against Texas.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,12.541,16.303,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,63.721,65.409,"The appellant is an adult, isn't he?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,65.409,66.149,Pardon me.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,66.149,67.33,"He is an adult, is he not?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,67.33,68.291,He is.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,70.221,75.282,He has been in mental institutions on how many occasions before this?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,75.282,78.013,The record isn't clear on exactly how many occasions.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,80.463,85.207,Somewhere in the record it suggested that he has been in ten times in the last five years.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,85.207,92.762,I believe it was something like eight or nine within the last five years.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,174.203,187.753,"If we go back to the standard, what was required to be proved to bring about a commitment in the jury trial that you say lasted five days?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,187.753,191.402,The substantive standard in Texas is two issues.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.704,215.381,And there was psychiatric testimony on both sides.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,215.381,218.085,There was a psychiatric testimony on the state's side.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,230.045,236.714,"And the psychiatric testimony was to the effect that he was schizophrenic, is that correct?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,236.714,237.754,"A schizophrenic, yes."
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.657,284.804,Does Texas provide any periodic review?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,284.804,291.617,Texas has a requirement that each patient be examined at least every six months.
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.792,308.538,Has the appellant sort that review?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,308.538,311.012,He has not.
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.012,314.749,But there have been six month reviews?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,314.749,321.453,"There had been, but this appeal has been pending all at that time."
1978.77-5992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.188,455.894,"Ms. Boston am I right in thinking that you do not here press the contention that although the beyond a reasonable doubt requirement might not be required by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is a requirement that a proof be at least by a clear and convincing evidence."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,455.894,461.557,"Well, Your Honor it's my position that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required."
1978.77-5992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,470.239,472.043,What makes you think that?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,472.043,486.062,"Well, there is a number of states that use clear and convincing and that has been argued in the briefs on the other side, well the amici briefs have suggested clear and convincing might be an alternative."
1978.77-5992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.062,501.128,"Well don't you think though that the rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which was applied at Winship, had great historical roots in the common law as proof for a criminal case."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,517.936,527.946,"I think you are right although of course this court has recognized clear and convincing is a standard in some cases, deportation for instance."
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,555.023,575.573,"Ms. Boston assuming the case in Texas and you have three equivalent psychiatrists of equivalent standards, I recognize, I didn't know two were exactly alike, but there are three of equivalent standing on each side."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,587.435,598.177,"Well, I believe Your Honor that -- well, first of all the Jury's function of course is to weigh the believability of each of those three or six equivalent psychiatrists."
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,598.177,600.948,But if it were a criminal case.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,600.948,601.577,That's right.
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.577,603.599,But this is not.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,603.599,613.007,That's right but very much the same thing is its state but additionally I don't believe that the state has to rely solely on psychiatric testimony in a vacuum.
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.954,629.123,"Well, can a layman do that without any help?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,629.123,642.94,Well I would suggest that the state bring in witnesses perhaps eye witnesses to acts of dangerous conduct or continuing history of self neglect.
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,651.477,657.644,The average person without a motive can find out that this is a schizophrenic person?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,657.644,658.614,Well that is an expert--
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,658.614,661.811,"Well, you'd at least have to tell him what a schizophrenic person was."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,661.811,670.525,"That's true, but being a schizophrenic person alone is not sufficient under the standard to lock a person in a mental hospital."
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.525,675.603,"Well, would you tell us again what the standard is in Texas?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,675.603,684.144,Yes it's for-- requires hospitalization for his own welfare and protection or the protection of others.
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,684.144,692.708,"So that's an opinion, that's a predictive opinion rather than any factual determination, isn't it?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,692.708,705.887,"Well it's really hard to distinguish what's predictive, what's historical, what's factual, it's all very much tied in together but it seems to me that the assessment comes from a factual basis."
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,705.887,719.588,Did jury-- did this jury hear from some witnesses that there had been ten episodes which previously led to his confinement in mental institutions over a period of five years?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,719.588,720.627,"Yes, it did."
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,720.627,726.393,So that that would be a basis on which they could draw some influences about the future?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,726.393,729.154,That's right; there were also factual witnesses there.
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.703,771.622,The reason I asked my question Ms. Boston is that it occurs to me that what standard of proof may be required is inevitably connected with what the standards are for involuntary commitment in any particular state.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,799.421,812.626,"Well I would think that that would be the area where we will allow the states their flexibility in drafting within of course guidelines of broadness and vagueness, allow the states the flexibility of creating, writing out their substantive criteria."
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,812.626,816.837,It isn't there where perhaps the real constitutional wise might lie.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,831.612,844.804,"Certainly that's true, but the wise, it seems to me is in the basic question of how much proof regardless of what we're proving, how much proof we are going to have, and that's what was addressed in Winship."
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,844.804,855.233,"Well, wouldn't that depend on what is necessary to show before somebody can be involuntary committed, aren't the two just inevitably connected?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,855.233,856.065,Well they are connected but I don't think--
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.065,878.604,"Can one say, can one say for the nation of fifty states, fifty individual states each with different standards for involuntary commitment that the constitution requires a certain level of proof because doesn't the level of proof isn't it as I say inexorably connected with what the substantive criteria are for involuntary commitment?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,878.604,887.129,Well Your Honor it is connected but in the same sense in the criminal context we don't vary the quantum of proof based on the elements of the offense.
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,887.129,890.935,But generally those are historic facts we're talking about in a criminal prosecution.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,890.935,893.225,Generally--
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.225,894.683,-- and other things.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,894.683,917.931,"Certainly, but again the predictive nature of these hearings of this evidence as it has been cast is not solely predictive it's-- there's very much factual evidence there and as I said the psychiatrists' assessments are based on factual evidence."
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,917.931,920.204,But they're giving their expert opinions.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,920.204,922.068,That's true.
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.127,955.325,"What if a state said that anybody can be involuntarily committed in our state, if in the opinion of two qualified psychiatrist, he should be?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,955.325,955.652,Well I think –
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.652,966.211,"And those were the substantive standards for involuntary commitment, now where's your burden of proof there if two qualified psychiatrists simply testified on opinion he should be involuntary committed."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,966.211,969.623,"Well I think those are two separate questions, I think--"
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,969.623,973.273,But what if a state did do that as a matter of a substantive law of involuntary commitment?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,973.273,976.329,Are you asking me if “beyond a reasonable doubt” could be met?
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.329,984.353,"Then there would be no question of burden of proof, the question would be are those substantive standards constitutionally permissible?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,984.353,990.377,"That's right but that's goes to the question, the substantive standards aren't in question here the only issue –"
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,990.377,1008.132,"No, I suggest though that what is in question is the burden of proof, I mean that's the what does a constitution require by a way of burden of proof and my suggestion and my question is that there maybe no one answer applicable to 50 different states because each State has different criteria for involuntary commitment."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1008.132,1009.324,I understand.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1009.324,1020.855,Are there not some states where the statute provides precisely what Mr. Justice Stewart has just outlined that a commitment involuntarily maybe made on the testimony of two physicians?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1020.855,1025.459,I'm not aware of there being any states that don't require other criteria.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1049.023,1065.182,Are there not some jurisdictions which provide that after the return of the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity that commitment to a mental institution maybe had simply on a preponderance of evidence?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1065.182,1065.844,Yes.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1065.844,1072.935,"Federal statutes and at least in the District of Columbia Code and in many states, is that not so?"
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1072.935,1079.03,"I believe it is, I am not a criminal law practitioner and I am not familiar with the statutes all across the line."
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.03,1081.651,But don't you think that's relevant?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1081.651,1098.332,"Well the question of the insanity defense, it seems to me as if the state, my understanding of Leland versus Oregon is that the state can require proof of the insanity defense beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore there is the imbalance that might--"
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.332,1101.798,Do you believe the state could commit without a trial?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1101.798,1103.865,Do I believe the state can commit without a trail?
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1103.865,1104.006,Yes.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1104.006,1105.991,No I do not; I believe that would be a clear violation.
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1105.991,1109.872,But do you have -- many states can still do it?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1109.872,1110.953,That commit without a trial?
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1110.953,1123.157,"Yes, on the written statement of two members of the medical profession even if they are obstetricians."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1123.157,1123.864,Well-
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1123.864,1127.624,Or eye specialists.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1127.624,1134.96,In Texas for instance that-- there does have to be that-- there but the hearing is required unless you are talking about commitment pending adjudication.
1978.77-5992,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1134.96,1135.899,How important is that?
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1140.912,1147.266,"Well I think if the state is going to commit somebody without a hearing just on the basis of that, I think that's a clear violation of defense."
1978.77-5992,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.266,1151.888,"Well in many states, well they may have a hearing they don't have a jury trial."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1151.888,1155.193,"That's true, but that's a very different analysis."
1978.77-5992,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1167.057,1171.558,"Ms Boston may I ask you a question, it's somewhat similar to Justice Stewart's question."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1195.114,1198.725,"Accepting the notion that that is, yes I mean--"
1978.77-5992,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1198.725,1210.025,"Now supposing if-- after that statute was enacted constitutionally, legislature said, “Well, we are going to add a fourth requirement that there be a prediction of future dangerousness either to the person himself or to others."
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1223.703,1227.329,Well all the state has to do is change the last criteria.
1978.77-5992,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1227.329,1235.04,But it cannot include the last criteria under your analysis unless it requires proof of beyond a reasonable doubt of that element of the determination.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1235.04,1237.277,That's right.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1256.633,1257.869,Very well Ms. Boston.
1978.77-5992,0,35497,martha_boston,,1257.869,1263.859,Thank you.
1978.77-5992,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1263.859,1265.746,Mr. Hury.
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1265.746,1269.909,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1390.587,1398.788,"Can you tell us a little bit at some point about the review procedures, the periodic reviews, do that at your own convenience."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1398.788,1409.6,My understanding Mr. Chief Justice is that there is a minimum requirement of two mandatory reviews or one mandatory review every six months or two per year.
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.796,1724.689,"As to change it to beyond a reason of doubt, intolerant to the State of Texas?"
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1724.689,1756.44,"As a question of whether it's intolerant or not, the problem I think pointed out by the State of Texas, and once again just pointing to Turner, is one of the inexact nature of psychiatric testimony, the inability of certain forms of the medical profession to predict what is going to happen in the future, and as to whether or not that particular ability to predict is available to the question of beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.229,1777.832,It's also true in a criminal case but you have to do it?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1777.832,1781.26,"Yes, sir without a doubt."
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.26,1785.323,"And in this, it's your position that you can't do it?"
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1785.323,1801.487,"It's our position that in denying certain abilities to prove certain things that is that there are certain standards that would be much more difficult to meet, that there are people who would be excluded from that process."
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.487,1804.217,"It is not impossible, it could be done."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1804.217,1808.479,It is being done; it is already the standard in several states.
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.479,1809.196,That is what I mean.
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1809.196,1810.961,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-5992,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1810.961,1822.512,"Mr. Hury, one of the amicus briefs, one for the National Center for Law and the Handicapped makes the argument that the unreliability of predictions cuts the other way."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1848.134,1851.999,The opposite argument is of course is valid.
1978.77-5992,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1877.502,1888.994,This problem would be avoided if you adopted a system such as Wisconsin has relying on past acts rather than opinions as to what might happen in the future that I guess part of it really relates to the substantive standards doesn't it?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1888.994,1890.946,I believe it does sir.
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.946,1911.425,Is this fundamentally very much different from the kind of predictive analysis which a parole board makes when it considers whether it should release a convicted prisoner half way or one-third the way through his commitment?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1911.425,1921.191,There is some analogy there and we have pointed out in our brief that we believe that there is some ability to predict some types of future behavior.
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.306,1943.163,"Well, that is the reporting requirements, but they can't monitor a parolee 24 hours a day or even once a day."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,1956.234,1977.428,"I agree that there is some similarity, but I think the difference here is that psychiatric testimony in the form of the mentally committed person is much less predictable than a mere idea of whether or not a person is going to back into a situation where they have committed crimes before."
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1977.428,1994.4,But a parole board in releasing a prisoner is making a decision that on balance is more unlikely not to engage in anti-social conduct than—that he will do so.
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2001.425,2005.104,I definitely agree with you Your Honor.
1978.77-5992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.104,2013.719,Are you defending the standard of proof that the Texas Court thought should obtain?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2013.719,2015.247,"Yes sir, I am."
1978.77-5992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.247,2017.581,Preponderance would be all right with you?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2017.581,2031.715,"The -- having taken part in these particular procedures, I guess of course I am skewed in one direction or another, but there is another side to some of these procedures, which myself as –"
1978.77-5992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.715,2036.135,"What about the preponderance standard, is that-- that is constitutional in your--?"
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2036.135,2038.004,"Yes sir, I believe so."
1978.77-5992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.903,2049.09,Although clear and convincing has been adopted by many states I take it.
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2049.09,2056.568,Some of the states even Illinois suggest that clear and convincing is the same thing as beyond a reasonable doubt only in a civil sector.
1978.77-5992,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.214,2066.072,Or a preponderance?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2066.072,2073.03,I think that there is a historical usage of preponderance and we would ask to able to rely on that.
1978.77-5992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.03,2092.445,"Well, there comes a point doesn't it when the Jury's eyes just glaze even on charges on the substantive issues if the judge goes on for 20 or 25 minutes as he usually does and the difference between preponderance of the evidence, and clear and convincing evidence is often lost on Jury."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2092.445,2095.627,"I agree with the Court, yes sir."
1978.77-5992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.627,2096.902,"I am not the Court, I am the one that–"
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2096.902,2098.518,I beg your pardon sir.
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.162,2124.971,"Here of course the trial judge gave a much stronger instruction and gave the one that Mr. Justice White alluded to as being required in some states is, if you know is that the general practice of trial judges in these hearings or do they stage the traditional preponderance test of civil cases?"
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2124.971,2134.556,I believe that so far as the State of Texas is concerned that it has been a usage to use the clear unequivocal and convincing and indeed--
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.556,2137.517,Even though the Supreme Court of the State says they don't need to do it.
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2137.517,2137.596,Yes sir.
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2137.596,2140.515,"Mr. Hury I notice you're from Galveston, you're local."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2140.515,2140.916,Yes sir.
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2140.916,2147.494,Can you speak for El Paso or any place else in Texas?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2147.494,2165.054,"Only by hoping that we all act under the same Mental Health Code that is enacted by the legislature but the -- in particularly the two cases which were decided in this question by the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, Turner and Addington were both--"
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.054,2166.642,Those are the two in your brief?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2166.642,2167.357,Yes sir.
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.856,2191.693,I assume what you are saying now is that you don't have to use the words “beyond a reasonable doubt” will you go that for?
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2203.602,2210.613,"No sir they did not and here again just as a person who has taken part in it, we would ask to be able to prove it by preponderance."
1978.77-5992,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.613,2223.465,"You are telling us that as the state court say, the only ones you know are the two, say that that's okay and that's what's expected a little bit more than preponderance."
1978.77-5992,1,31034,james_hury,,2223.465,2247.416,"That's what was submitted by lower court but the Supreme Court said that in the future they direct those courts to have a preponderance of evidence as the criteria from their own, as mentioned in virtue of the last paragraph of the State of Texas', the Supreme Court's opinion."
1978.77-5992,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.272,2258.05,Very well.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2259.389,2261.669,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.746,2465.583,"Well, suppose the substantive standard does depend in part on a past act, a historical fact, which way would you run the argument a lower or a higher standard of proof should be required."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2467.496,2471.958,"To the extent it's a past act, it's certainly more feasible to prove by a higher standard of proof."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.958,2472.265,Yes.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2472.265,2483.849,"There's no doubt, but my argument would be that the constitution shouldn't require that because the state can then address its standard of proof to the given criteria."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.849,2492.457,"Is it your argument, your argument in a way is that the standard of proof should -- depends to some extent on the substantive standard?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2492.457,2496.987,"I think the standard of proof affects it, not that it depends upon, I think it is a matter of constitutional law."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.987,2505.965,"In which way do you run it, the looser the standard, the looser the standard-- what should happen to the burden of proof then or the standard of proof go up or down?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2505.965,2510.147,"As a matter of constitutional law, I think it should be unaffected."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.147,2516.187,Now so that the standard you choose really doesn't depend on the substantive standard?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2516.187,2520.91,"The standard of proof will affect the substantive standard I'm arguing, because if you choose a high –"
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2520.91,2524.752,"Yes, but a substantive standard shouldn't affect the standard of proof?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2524.752,2525.432,I think that's right.
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.678,2553.108,"Because some of the arguments in the briefs at file the -- are that the looser the standard the higher -- the looser the substantive ground, the higher the standard of proof because the more margin for error."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2553.108,2556.97,"Well, there is more margin for error, but it depends what do you mean by “error” Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-5992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.645,2605.611,Mr. Klein he does that I take it whether the offense with which he is charged is subject to a six months penalty or death penalty.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2605.611,2609.268,"That's correct, but in civil commitment that's not the case."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.021,2622.642,"So if the lower standard of proof means the possibility of more error, we ought to just put up with it."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2622.642,2623.555,"Well, it depends on what kind of error."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.555,2629.599,Because the consequences of error are not as disagreeable as in the criminal.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2629.599,2630.948,They're far different.
1978.77-5992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.15,2643.351,"Well, and the consequences of error and erroneously sentencing somebody to a six-month sentence are considerably different than the consequences of error in sentencing someone to death are they not?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2643.351,2674.361,"Yes they are, but there is no higher standard of proof than proof beyond a reasonable doubt but even in this six-month case Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if he goes free, if the criminal walks out, he gets a windfall if he did it, whereas if the patient walks out, because society or psychiatry cannot adduce enough evidence to satisfy an unduly high burden, the patient is not helped, we do no favor to let somebody walk out of an arena and return in to freedom who is very, very ill."
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2690.372,2696.885,"But if you keep developing this than you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt, if you say this man is so violent."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2696.885,2701.178,"This particular gentleman, that's right, that's the problem with the process."
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.697,2715.719,Then it's your submission then in this case Texas could without any problem prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2715.719,2734.111,"Could prove the fact that this gentleman engaged in past threats and acts, that is true, they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems to me, that his mental illness was so severe or that the effects of not treating him would be to have his condition deteriorate and his violence to increase in the future."
1978.77-5992,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2734.111,2750.254,"But do we set a standard ordinarily in the law because of the potential of being able to meet the high standard that is simply because Texas could prove beyond the reasonable doubt as they might, well they've been able to do here."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2754.206,2766.222,"Absolutely not Your Honor, it seems to me that is a legislative determination which legislatures have and can make, but that's not a determination that this court as a matter of constitutional law should make."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.222,2775.981,"Mr. Klein you are arguing as I understand that if we-- unless we lower the standard, have a relatively low standard, there will people who will go free who ought to be committed?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2783.165,2784.004,I think that's right.
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.004,2790.813,And we must-- what you are saying it's better to accept the risk of a significant number of people being erroneously committed than the other side?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2790.813,2794.719,"Well, it depends again what an erroneous commitment is, this is a little different than the criminal law."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.719,2799.987,Well one does not in fact satisfy the standard of danger to himself or others or being mentally ill.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2802.169,2807.916,That is correct and it does seem to me there is a potential for that erroneous commitment and it increases as you lower the standard.
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.916,2814.108,Do you disagree with the essence of the statistical material in the brief I referred to earlier about the probabilities?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2815.535,2819.369,"Well, I certainly disagree with the issue on probabilities about mental illness."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.952,2839.129,"What in your judgment or the judgment of your client, what is the probability that a prediction of dangerousness to oneself or others by psychiatrist will be accurate?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2839.129,2840.992,If by dangerous you mean physical?
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.992,2848.209,"Well within the meaning of the Texas Standard, how reliably can you predict that?"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2848.209,2852.522,"It's very hard to say, Your Honor, it could be, it depends on each individual case."
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.208,2870.757,"So then you would say to me you are necessarily conceding that if you have a low standard of proof there maybe 30 or 40% of the people that are committed, that should not be committed."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2870.757,2876.127,If in fact your standard is dangerousness in a sense of acting physical violence--
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.127,2876.173,Yes.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2876.173,2880.388,But those are people who maybe very ill and desperately needed help.
1978.77-5992,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.388,2889.089,"But then if then-- if the dangerousness is not critical, you're really saying you are acting for the benefit of the patient, you need a low standard of proof because he doesn't know what's good for himself."
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2889.089,2892.015,"I think that states are entitled to that option, that's all I'm saying."
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.982,2939.042,Do you support commitment without trial?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2939.042,2944.14,"Not long term commitment, no there maybe emergency situations Your Honor, but not long terms commitment, absolutely not."
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.14,2945.75,And that trail would be a jury trial?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2945.75,2950.273,"No sir, no sir we don't think that the constitution requires a jury trial."
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2954.571,2957.341,How many states have a jury trial?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2957.341,2962.735,"I think approximately half have in place a statute Mr. Justice Stewart, yes sir."
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.735,2964.783,You just want to leave it to the states.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2964.783,2967.055,I think that's right because I think this is a terribly difficult source.
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.055,2969.264,Why could not do with the due process clause?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2969.264,2980.069,The due process clause is -- court realized I think in Partterson and numerous cases is well satisfied when you have the basics of due process and Texas certainly and I think all states now for a long term commitment.
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2980.069,2981.334,Including Maryland?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2981.334,2982.36,Including Maryland for long term.
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2982.36,2984.009,When did Maryland change?
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2984.009,2987.706,"I think Maryland changed in '76 Your Honor, don't hold me to the date but it has been an amendment to the statute."
1978.77-5992,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.706,2991.246,It didn't change last time it was in this court.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2991.246,3001.403,"Well but I think that's a different problem and if a state would come in here and have a long term commitment statute with no due process, I think that would raise another issue."
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3004.032,3005.309,"Well, that's the claim here--"
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3005.309,3006.271,The claim is that this particular--
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.271,3007.436,Is a due process claim.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3007.436,3012.254,"Yes, with this particular procedure -- Mr. Justice Marshall was saying if they had no trial whatsoever."
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.254,3014.652,But I am saying it is a due process claim.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3014.652,3015.332,I understand and I think--
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.332,3016.542,That is the case here.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3016.542,3017.619,Absolutely.
1978.77-5992,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3022.407,3024.638,Well that's the issue in the case.
1978.77-5992,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3024.638,3028.756,Yes.
1978.77-5992,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3081.478,3083.302,You have anything further Ms. Boston?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3083.302,3088.909,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-5992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.736,3128.121,"I understood, and let me say that there a lot of mentally ill people who have not committed acts of violence and that the state has an interest in seeing that they get help."
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3128.121,3133.64,I believe he said both Your Honor in relation to that latter statement.
1978.77-5992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.395,3162.588,But you are not saying that a past act is constitutionally required as a substantive element of --
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3162.588,3172.053,No I am not; I am saying that that is way of buttressing psychiatric testimony so that you don't have to rely just on the inaccuracies.
1978.77-5992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3172.053,3180.538,Wouldn't it become pretty much mandatory if your view is adopted in order to get anybody committed?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3180.538,3182.979,I don't believe it would become mandatory.
1978.77-5992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3223.291,3228.661,But is-- the defendant convicted under that system doesn't get a one year reevaluation?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3228.661,3229.975,No he doesn't.
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.678,3283.303,"You're emphasizing understandably so the parallelism to criminal system but then the administration of criminal justice we have in the country thousands, literally thousands of law enforcement officers who are roaming, looking for criminal conduct and then arresting people and probably thousands with fewer prosecutors who are constantly alluded to in charged with the duty of prosecuting."
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3290.469,3294.236,Not that I'm aware of although we have truly --
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3294.236,3303.183,"Well, the police may bring it to the attention of hospitals incidentally but there is no comparable structure."
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3337.656,3340.873,I don't think its as insidious as doing in.
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3356.448,3359.94,See even the psychiatrists admit that they don't understand it very well.
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3359.94,3383.431,"Certainly and Mr. Klein's, the American Psychiatrics Association's brief is full of references, as its appellant, to the kinds of problems that people face; that mental patients and former mental patients are feared and loafed in our society because people don't understand and its in the first place it sort of ease --"
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.431,3390.523,"How is the burden, how is the change to the maximum burden of proof, the criminal burden of proof trying to help that situation?"
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3390.523,3400.984,"Well, what it's going to do is keep those people who are not proper subjects of commitment from being committed, therefore stigmatized, being deprived of their liberty."
1978.77-5992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.963,3437.078,Do you think someone who has gone through a five day jury trial as your client did here and been acquitted after all the testimony and the evidence are found not mentally ill would be welcomed back into the bosom of society so to speak?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3437.078,3448.437,"Well, of course the society in which he was living was very aware of all of that and clearly he has been stigmatized to begin with."
1978.77-5992,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3477.012,3485.038,"Ms. Boston what is it, that has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt under your new mentally retarded statute?"
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3485.038,3505.416,The exact -- because of the retardation the person represents a substantial risk of physical impairment or injury to himself or others or is unable to provide for and is not providing for his most basic physical needs.
1978.77-5992,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3505.416,3507.032,That's predictive isn't it?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3509.164,3509.91,That's right.
1978.77-5992,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3509.91,3514.353,How is that differ from the issue we have here?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3514.353,3518.463,Mental retardation is just about the only difference.
1978.77-5992,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3528.544,3533.045,"What's the nature of the trial under that statute, jury or non jury?"
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3533.045,3535.682,They are entitled to a jury.
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.682,3546.618,Do you think Texas or any state is constitutionally required to have the same standard for retardation as they do for commitments of -- or schizophrenia?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3546.618,3560.587,"I think there's probably some very different considerations that go into them, but this proceeding of commitment to mental retardation facility is very similar in what it seeks to do."
1978.77-5992,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3569.974,3580.875,You just read it to us that's wholly predictive element isn't it noting else?
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3580.875,3590.181,"Well, it's in the same way that we're talking about prediction before it's-- it's prediction based on retardation and acts and so on."
1978.77-5992,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.181,3593.224,But there has to be a determination for mental retardation.
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3593.224,3599.779,"Mental retardation, in the same way that the Mental Health Code requires a determination of mental illness."
1978.77-5992,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3654.684,3670.108,"Can you get a psychiatrist to testify and say in these words that, “I make this diagnosis beyond a reasonable doubt --” have you heard psychiatrist say anything close to that?"
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3670.108,3671.0,I've never heard of psychiatrist say that.
1978.77-5992,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3671.0,3673.505,"They always say, “Well, on the other hand--”"
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3673.505,3678.935,"Medical-- reasonable medical certainty, but the question of burden of proof doesn't."
1978.77-5992,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3678.935,3682.864,Back to my original point -- I mean get with this--
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3682.864,3687.626,"Well, the jury doesn't-- I don't believe the jury has to apply that standard to each witness."
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3699.572,3708.245,The jury can reject any particular witness or an individual jury can on the grounds that he doesn't believe him or it doesn't think he is very reliable or very sound.
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3708.245,3708.595,Certainly.
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3708.595,3710.26,"That's credibility factor, isn't it?"
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3710.26,3721.331,"Certainly my point is that the creditability factor goes into the jury agreement, it doesn't happen when we bring -- we don't require a psychiatrist to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt, obviously."
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3725.73,3726.642,Thank you counsel.
1978.77-5992,3,35497,martha_boston,,3726.642,3726.659,Thank you.
1978.77-5992,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3726.659,3729.661,The case is submitted.
