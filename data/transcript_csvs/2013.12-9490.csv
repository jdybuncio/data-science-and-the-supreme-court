2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.235,"We'll hear argument in Case 12-9490, Navarette v. California."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,5.987,8.337,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,53.218,70.26,"So if the tip -- if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing bombs out the window, okay, every, you know, whatever, 500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the window themselves before pulling them over?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,70.26,73.981,"Well, Your Honor, in terms of the reasonable suspicion, yes."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,86.456,94.043,"So your answer is yes, the car is going there and he's throwing a bomb out and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees them throw out another bomb?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,94.043,95.976,"--Your Honor, under the Florida-J."
2013.12-9490,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,110.319,120.524,I thought that J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is somebody is carrying a bomb?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,120.524,122.976,"--Well, there is that exception, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.184,138.572,"Throwing bombs doesn't count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,141.055,144.909,"--Your Honor, that would not make a difference."
2013.12-9490,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,152.646,153.082,Excuse me.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,164.889,177.547,"--Your Honor, technically it would not be, but in the circumstances here, I think it should be treated as an anonymous tip because, again, the name could be false when the tip first comes in."
2013.12-9490,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,180.332,182.049,"Well, how would you corroborate it?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,194.139,221.723,"--Again, if all they have is an assertion by the -- by the tipster that this is the name and the address, if the officers can somehow, again, by caller identification or some other method verify that in fact that is the person so that somewhere down the line that person will be held accountable for a false tip, then it can be treated differently."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,221.723,223.075,"Well, what if you have caller ID."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,235.566,236.516,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.237,245.422,Isn't that all caller ID gives you?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,245.422,258.748,"--Well, with caller ID, if they are somehow able to verify, not just that this is coming from this phone, but that in fact there's a particular person there, if they can identify the location, that sort of thing."
2013.12-9490,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,299.523,307.579,"If we transport the standard that applies outside of the vehicle context to this context, what would happen in this situation?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,339.383,351.458,"--No, Your Honor, because still they wouldn't be able to prosecute them because the fact that the vehicle is now not weaving doesn't show that they were -- that it was or was not weaving--"
2013.12-9490,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,351.458,353.293,"I mean, your argument goes well beyond."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,372.187,372.571,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,393.416,403.856,Give me an example of a situation in which the police can pull somebody over after receiving a tip without actually seeing the vehicle commit an illegal act?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,403.856,413.729,"--I think, Your Honor, in a situation where the caller calls in, says I'm, I've been -- this car is driving erratically."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,482.223,487.96,Do we have any indication that this is a serious problem?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,489.379,494.783,"Well, there's no empirical evidence in the record."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,539.429,541.312,"Well, is that -- is that true?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,546.933,560.342,"--The most recent -- the most recent statistics show a little more, about 11,000 people die from homicides by firearms, and it's usually under 10,000 now that are driving -- dying by drunk driving."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,592.714,604.871,"I was just going to say, we have held that the -- the standards are loosened in the vehicle context because your expectation of privacy is diminished when you're out on the road driving along in -- in a vehicle."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,606.806,617.945,"I don't think so in this case, Your Honor, because even though it's diminished as opposed to, for example, in the home, it's -- in J.L., of course, the person was on a public sidewalk; the person was not in the home."
2013.12-9490,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,632.022,638.026,"But in the context in which we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get bent out of shape over this?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,638.026,657.339,"Well, Your Honor, in the sobriety checkpoint case, the Court has looked at the intrusion and found that to be at the very rock bottom in terms of intrusion, the fact that somebody is -- along with a number of other people, that they have to submit to a brief stop, it has put that on the lowest -- on the lowest level."
2013.12-9490,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.499,674.099,"Well, but why is that an important line?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,678.92,681.454,"Well, because the -- the intrusion is greater, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,737.124,749.516,White suggested that we don't have an absolute rule with respect to requiring independent corroboration of the actual illegal conduct.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,812.939,813.941,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,818.159,831.317,"Well, that's just not true in Florida v. J.L. because the individual didn't match the description completely and there were two or three individuals there, not just one."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,840.089,848.778,"--Well, there was no predictive detail, but in J.L., the tip was a young black male in a plaid shirt at a bus stop."
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.464,853.082,Correct me if -- if I'm wrong.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,865.374,867.007,"Well, it was -- it was possession--"
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,867.007,872.478,"But -- but here -- here, there was -- the report was a crime."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,874.913,888.239,"--Well, in -- in J.L., they didn't say illegal gun possession, but presumably, the tipster thought it was an illegal gun possession and the officer must have thought it was illegal gun possession."
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.239,888.672,Well--
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.672,890.039,And it was illegal.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,890.039,891.107,What?
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.107,892.057,It was illegal.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,892.057,894.659,"Oh, it was, because he turned out to be under 21."
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,894.659,901.33,"--But -- but the tip, in and of itself, did not indicate that a crime was being committed, which is different from this case."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,901.33,906.384,"I'll agree that the tipster didn't say it, but I think the assumption--"
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,906.384,908.903,"No, I'm talking about an interpretation of what the tip said."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,908.903,918.608,"--Well -- but unless -- unless the -- the implication is that the gun possession is illegal, then there's no reason for the officer to--"
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,918.608,919.308,"No, a Terry stop."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,919.308,920.258,--Hmm?
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.258,922.226,You might have had grounds for a Terry stop.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,922.226,947.961,"But if -- if the tip calls -- if the tips says I'm looking at a case of gun possession that, as far as I know, is perfectly legal, it's like in this case if the tip came in and said: I've just been passed by a car whose -- which was driven very skillfully, there's no point in -- in pursuing the tip in J.L. unless there's some -- some element of illegality."
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.961,954.282,"Well, I -- I think there's a difference, but I think for our purposes we can assume that the cases are comparable in that respect--"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,954.282,954.715,Okay.
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,954.715,957.833,"--but not comparable, perhaps, in others."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,957.833,958.383,Okay.
2013.12-9490,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,989.455,992.657,No reason to believe the caller had personal knowledge.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,992.657,993.19,Pardon me?
2013.12-9490,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,993.19,995.942,No reason to believe the person had personal knowledge.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,995.942,997.21,"Well, but personal knowledge--"
2013.12-9490,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,997.21,1003.697,He didn't say that the gun was pulled on him or that -- or how he saw it or how he knew.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1003.697,1003.914,--Right.
2013.12-9490,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1007.766,1014.003,So you don't think there's something significant about calling up and saying someone forced me off the road?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1014.003,1016.355,"Well, there is something significant, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1038.201,1041.822,What if there's no way for the officer to corroborate the allegation?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1067.987,1075.726,"Well, Your Honor, if -- if that's all they have to go on, then under Florida v. J.L. they would not."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.726,1080.128,So just -- your answer in that case is that the police cannot pull that car over?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1080.128,1087.048,"If -- in terms of -- obviously, it's a more serious situation, but the Court has not held that the seriousness--"
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1087.048,1087.982,"Well, let's expand it a little bit."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1103.843,1121.871,"--Well, Your Honor, if you're talking in terms of just the seriousness and you're looking in terms of the Florida v. J.L. exception, the Court seemed to be indicating in that case that there would be a danger that was so extreme where the Court would find a search or a stop justified without any showing of--"
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1121.871,1125.59,"Well, just in terms of your position, do you think they could pull the car over?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1125.59,1126.507,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.296,1137.148,You get an A for consistency.
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.833,1142.784,I'm -- I'm not sure he gets an A for consistency.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1173.471,1175.256,"Your Honor, I believe--"
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.256,1178.208,"He tells you the license number, where the car is."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1179.325,1189.349,"--I believe, consistent with what the court said in Florida v. J.L., that may be a situation, again, where the court decides that -- that the risk is so great--"
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.349,1190.649,"So you see, he's not consistent."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1190.649,1191.915,--No.
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.66,1218.23,"So the -- the atomic bomb, the level of danger is great enough, but the young girl in the trunk, the level of danger is not great enough?"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1218.23,1228.688,"--Your Honor, what I'm saying, in either of those situations, the Court may want to consider some sort of exception to the reasonable suspicion standard and that seems to be--"
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1228.688,1233.492,What is your position what you would do if you were on this Court with those hypotheticals?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1236.194,1243.114,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the Court may well want to -- to craft some--"
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.114,1247.666,What is your position as to what the Court should do in those cases?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1247.666,1257.123,"--Well, let me start off by saying, if I could, that I don't think the Court needs to reach that question in this case, just as it did not need to reach that question in J.L.--"
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.123,1259.29,"I understand it, but we're interested in the hypothetical."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1259.29,1259.54,--Right.
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.637,1281.737,What about this?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1300.032,1300.549,That's right.
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1300.549,1301.3,All right.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1308.57,1314.291,"Except, Your Honor, that, in fact, when we're talking about drunk driving, whether the person is inebriated or not--"
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.291,1321.212,Didn't -- didn't the tip here have something to do with his driving around in a wild way or at least an unusual way?
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1325.83,1326.298,--Right.
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.164,1365.14,It seems to me you're willing to accept our allowing -- or allowing the police to stop the car with the atom bomb and even allowing the police to stop the car with the kidnapped girl in the trunk.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1388.172,1395.86,"And, Your Honor, I didn't mean to concede that the Court should -- should reduce the level of suspicion for reasonable suspicion in order to do that."
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.86,1396.193,Okay.
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1401.414,1409.252,"In this case, your -- your grade for consistency depends on this answer."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1409.902,1410.752,Excuse me?
2013.12-9490,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1410.752,1413.904,Your grade for consistency depends on this answer.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1413.904,1419.125,"What I'm saying, Your Honors, is the State is arguing for a sliding scale that changes things."
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1430.516,1444.259,"But -- that's why I asked you, and I pressed the point a little bit, because in the beginning of your brief, it says that the anonymous tip, what you say, indicated that a Ford F-150 pickup truck had run someone off the road."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1444.259,1444.943,That's right.
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.943,1456.316,"Now, maybe you do have to know specially whether the person's drunk or not, but you don't have to have some special knowledge of anything concealed to know if somebody has run somebody off the road."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1456.316,1461.135,"But, Your Honor, the -- the idea of running off the road is concealed--"
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.135,1465.606,"Even if the person weren't drunk, I think it's illegal to run someone else off the road."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1465.606,1466.739,--I'm not disagreeing with Your Honor.
2013.12-9490,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1466.739,1467.122,No.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1467.122,1481.216,"What I'm saying is that unless the person is still driving erratically by the time that the officers arrive, then that activity is concealed in the same way that the question of whether J.L. had a gun or not was concealed."
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.041,1506.499,"And I assume you would -- you would also say, to tie it into Justice Breyer's question, you would also say that that tip,"
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1518.723,1519.59,"That's right, Your Honor."

2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1532.23,1535.766,"Your Honor, absolutely the police can follow that car and that's what they should do."
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.22,1544.555,Following the car is going to do them no good as to whether he drove -- drove somebody off the road.
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1549.342,1549.642,--Right.
2013.12-9490,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.233,1564.735,"They could if the guy admitted it, you know."

2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1578.126,1585.797,"Well, but you -- what if the person said okay, my name is this, you know, my phone number is this; this guy drove me off the road."
2013.12-9490,0,38062,paul_r_kleven,,1597.52,1609.228,"--Well, what I'm saying is, yes, they have to verify in some way so that they have some reason to believe that, in fact, the person that's telling them this is actually the person that is being -- so I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2013.12-9490,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.228,1609.828,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1611.164,1616.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1641.033,1643.135,Is every reckless driving drunk driving?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1643.135,1644.135,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.135,1646.853,Is every reckless driving drunk driving?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1646.853,1649.305,Not every reckless driving is drunk driving.
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.443,1672.318,"How about if somebody just calls and says, X vehicle is driving recklessly, says no more, doesn't describe how, doesn't give you any details as to how they know it."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1675.254,1677.037,I would say that the term “ reckless ” is.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.464,1694.066,But not necessarily drunkenness.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1705.705,1711.276,"Well, I wouldn't say they're synonymous, but I would say that one is the indicator of the other, because while you can--"
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1711.276,1711.559,Why?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1715.944,1720.079,--I would say a report of speeding is not sufficient to have reasonable suspicion.
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1720.079,1721.431,Isn't that reckless behavior?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1734.672,1747.33,"I would say that, once again, the public has lots of familiarity with driving, and they can recognize the difference between poor driving and reckless driving, or something, or drunk driving."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.481,1782.486,"And -- and between the, what, 50 and 75 percent they've stopped people without just cause."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1782.486,1784.938,"--Yes, but we are talking about reasonable suspicion."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.223,1790.257,Or they've -- they've troubled people who shouldn't have been troubled.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1790.257,1791.275,That is correct.
2013.12-9490,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1794.727,1798.096,"What -- what if the call is, you know, I'm driving."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1804.017,1810.937,"No, I don't believe that would be sufficient to pull him over because you don't have any governmental -- you don't have a threat to public safety in that context."
2013.12-9490,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.937,1815.308,"Well, there are laws against driving without a seat belt because that protects people's lives."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1815.308,1826.698,"Certainly, there are laws, and the officer, I guess, would have reasonable suspicion that there is a traffic violation, but I don't know that it would rise to the level of implicating public safety in this context."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.698,1831.417,"Well, reckless driving always does, whether it -- whether it's the consequence of inebriation or not."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1831.417,1832.252,Yes.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.252,1835.638,"So a simple call saying, boy, this guy, you know, he cut in, in front of me."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1837.74,1839.223,Yes.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.223,1845.66,"--that -- that enables the policeman, without observing any of that reckless driving, to stop the car further down the road."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1845.66,1846.11,Yes.
2013.12-9490,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1850.814,1852.833,I've never understood.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1872.528,1873.662,--Well--
2013.12-9490,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.662,1876.714,"Whether he is or not, the police go up, they pull him over and find out, yes, yes."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1881.166,1894.326,"--The importance of those details is that they allow the officers to confirm that this is a personal observation, which is an important fact that's noted in Gates, that when you have a report of personal observation of illegal conduct, we can take that report more seriously."
2013.12-9490,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.86,1898.043,My question--
2013.12-9490,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.043,1904.63,I was just going to say my point is it need not necessarily be a personal observation of the person operating the car.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1919.373,1920.475,"--Yes, that is true."
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1941.739,1949.326,"But if I understand you correctly, as long as you can identify the car, you need no specificity as to what the car has actually done."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1955.58,1962.068,"--Well, I would say that recklessness carries information that is -- has some specificity."
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1962.068,1962.952,What would fail your test?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,1962.952,1967.37,"Well, if a caller calls in and says, I saw him in a bar."
2013.12-9490,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1972.424,1972.841,--Yes.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2015.017,2016.667,"--Well, if a caller says--"
2013.12-9490,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.667,2018.819,I'm not saying common sense.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2021.988,2028.509,--Where the courts have upheld based on just a bare tip?
2013.12-9490,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.509,2030.111,Not a bare tip.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2057.178,2063.765,The closest case I can think of is Hensley where an officer was relying on an arrest bulletin from another jurisdiction.
2013.12-9490,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.422,2086.447,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but my recollection of Hensley is, you're right, the police department 1 notifies police department 2."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2095.053,2098.688,"--Well, there were two parts to the -- to the case."
2013.12-9490,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2107.11,2107.426,I understand that.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2107.426,2115.63,"And so it looked to the nature of the crime, and whether there was threat to public safety is a validation consideration in authorizing a stop for a prior offense."
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2122.636,2128.89,Hensley's victim wasn't a victim; meaning there was -- it was an anonymous tip?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2128.89,2131.242,"--No, it was from another police jurisdiction."
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2131.242,2131.992,"Yes, that's what I'm saying."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2133.511,2134.644,"No, it was not an anonymous tip."
2013.12-9490,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2134.644,2135.894,It wasn't public safety.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2139.163,2140.198,"Yes, it was."
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2152.822,2154.257,"And, Mr. Laurence, do I understand what you're saying?"
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2176.138,2182.442,"What I'm saying is that in terms of when we can deem a tip reliable, White identified two components to the inquiry."
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2193.732,2202.005,"Well, I don't understand how what you're saying is different from what I just said, and that would seem to me to work quite a substantial change in -- in Fourth Amendment law."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2211.528,2218.282,"Well, I think since the inception of the doctrine, this Court identified in Terry that reasonable suspicion results from a balancing of the governmental interest."
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2218.282,2220.467,The balancing occurs categorically.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2240.48,2251.505,"Well, I believe that was something that was indicated in Hensley, that this Court looked to the nature of the offense in deciding whether or not the officer had reasonable suspicion at the inception in making that stop for a crime that had occurred two weeks earlier."
2013.12-9490,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.522,2288.028,"Could you explain to me one more time why it's relevant that there were these details that it was a particular kind of crime, that it was silver, the license plate."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2303.538,2305.056,"--Well, I think it helps twofold."
2013.12-9490,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2324.133,2329.369,And incidentally -- it doesn't have much to do with the case -- is this a two -- a two-lane road?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2329.369,2330.219,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.219,2330.619,That's what I thought.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2330.619,2338.056,"Two-lane coastal highway, which obviously, when someone runs somebody off the road, poses a grave threat to public safety in that context."
2013.12-9490,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2338.056,2350.282,"There's a tip that someone is carrying a concealed weapon, and we have held that that has to be corroborated -- corroborated."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2383.02,2388.908,"Well, I think there's a significant difference between having a gun in your pocket and actually brandishing it or firing it."
2013.12-9490,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2396.927,2400.798,"But if you -- once -- once you brandish it, it's too late."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2403.517,2407.035,--That is -- that is correct.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.658,2419.627,"Of course, this call didn't say I think the guy was drunk."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2422.829,2423.379,--Yes.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2423.379,2423.914,Right?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2435.971,2438.388,"Well, I would say that in this case, it is enough."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.046,2449.379,Okay.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2450.748,2451.381,--Okay.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.381,2452.681,Really irresponsibly.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2452.681,2453.433,Very irresponsibly.
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2453.433,2469.043,"So do you think, Mr. Laurence, if the police had followed this man for half an hour and seen no other signs of erratic driving and nobody can drunk drive -- can drive drunk for half an hour without swerving, without doing something else."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2472.244,2478.748,I think there may be a point where the threat to public safety would suggest that the reasonable suspicion is dissipated in that context.
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2481.1,2497.962,"Well, I thought you were saying as long as somebody had -- had given an account that sometime ago he had driven another driver off -- he had run another driver off the road, doesn't matter whether you're drunk, doesn't matter anything, there was an account of an illegal act taking place, and that was enough to stop him."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2499.145,2503.364,"--Well, I believe that the threat to public safety plays a role in the balance."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.801,2535.451,It wasn't a report of drunk driving.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2535.451,2535.884,I'm sorry.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.684,2539.769,Somebody ran me off the road.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2542.621,2543.005,Yes.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.005,2545.273,That's enough to stop him down the road.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2545.273,2545.84,It is.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.544,2552.977,"What about cutting me off too quickly, you know?"
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2552.977,2554.429,--I think that--
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.429,2555.763,Cuts right in front of me.
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2557.047,2560.832,--That would present a different set of circumstances.
2013.12-9490,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2573.39,2580.913,"Well, how would somebody -- how would somebody ever be able -- who observes another car driving ever be able to say that person was drunk?"
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2586.317,2586.967,--I agree.
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.182,2615.736,"I think it's an entirely different case if the tip -- if the tip here was, you know, I was at a party."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2640.201,2643.07,"--Well, again, I would say it's not about demonstrating."
2013.12-9490,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2649.057,2650.909,"Well, why is it limited to drunk driving?"
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2690.134,2691.65,"Well, I wouldn't draw that distinction."
2013.12-9490,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2708.926,2713.313,"But all crime represents a threat to public safety, and yet we have these standards."
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2713.313,2715.865,"--Yes, we do have standards."
2013.12-9490,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.66,2735.543,Why?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2773.302,2789.814,"Well, I believe that when you're looking at, at what point it's reasonable for the officer to rely on the content of that tip or to rely on -- on that tip coming in and act on it, that when somebody gives their name, that adds a layer of reliability to it, even without verification."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.679,2822.135,You don't think a teenager standing on a street corner with a couple of other teenagers with a gun in his belt represents a threat to public safety?
2013.12-9490,1,31412,jeffrey_m_k_laurence,,2822.135,2824.385,"--Not the same threat as in this case, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.385,2824.82,No?
2013.12-9490,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2825.287,2827.037,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2848.185,2850.918,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-9490,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2863.028,2863.512,All right.
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2881.173,2881.823,--So--
2013.12-9490,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2881.823,2886.241,What -- what other things would a -- would a caller have to say?
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2886.241,2896.78,"--So, Your Honor, I think I agree with the observation that there are some behaviors that pose an ongoing threat to others on the roadway, and some driving violations that don't."
2013.12-9490,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2921.645,2923.578,"Well, what -- what goes on the other side of the line?"
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2927.047,2927.632,--Sure.
2013.12-9490,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2948.213,2953.015,"I think what you're saying to me, am I correct, that almost any moving violation counts?"
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2958.169,2962.886,--I think that would be a harder case.
2013.12-9490,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2975.63,2977.563,How about somebody cutting someone off in their lane?
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2977.563,2982.8,"--I think that's close to the line, Your Honor."
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.894,3007.834,"Well, where does that -- I think this is the question Justice Kagan asked earlier -- how does the nature of the offense affect the reasonableness of the suspicion?"
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3007.834,3008.617,--So--
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3008.617,3013.755,"I mean, in either case, you have let's say the seat belt and the swerving driver."
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3023.111,3029.515,"--I think that's true, Your Honor, and we actually think and, you know, we argued in our brief that there is reasonable suspicion here."
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.579,3077.646,"Well, that's just not true."
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3087.703,3093.707,"So, Your Honor, I think this class of people who are going to have the relevant knowledge is almost exclusively eyewitnesses."
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3106.098,3120.356,"No, I'm talking about the concern that you want to have the police pull over people that you don't like, where you know somebody's got something bad in the car and you don't like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the fact that the police don't have to observe anything and yet you can still get them to pull over this person."
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3120.356,3128.544,"So somebody who's malicious, who's a prankster, is still going to have this kind of specialized knowledge, and that's not something a malicious prankster is necessarily going to have."
2013.12-9490,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3128.544,3141.937,"Why is that different from the knowledge in J.L. that they were three young men, they were described, and the caller says"
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3161.331,3167.65,"Your Honor, I think the critical thing that's present here that wasn't present in J.L. is the basis for knowledge."
2013.12-9490,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3185.546,3189.333,But then you think J.L. would have come out differently if the tipster had said
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3193.218,3196.237,I think this case comes out differently for two reasons.
2013.12-9490,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.785,3229.308,"Yeah, but that -- but that second danger -- you may have a drunken driver on the road; that danger can be eliminated by following the car."
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3252.24,3260.929,"Your Honor, officers could follow the car, and if they do, they may witness a subsequent dangerous behavior that could justify pulling over the car."
2013.12-9490,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.183,3269.785,That is so remote.
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3293.833,3296.352,"Your Honor, I don't think it's a remote harm at all."
2013.12-9490,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.029,3324.953,But here we have the police did follow the vehicle for about 5 miles and saw nothing erratic about the driving.
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3351.653,3359.59,"Your Honor, I agree that police might follow a car for such a long period of time that the reasonable suspicion would dissipate."
2013.12-9490,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3383.789,3385.224,I don't know if we have to get into the drunk driving.
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3404.452,3411.539,"--The only thing I can point to about that, Your Honor, is the way that the California Supreme Court treated this, which is that."
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.765,3426.967,What about the danger from the police side?
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3439.208,3440.375,Your Honor--
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.375,3442.577,What protection is there against that.
2013.12-9490,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3442.577,3455.05,"--Your Honor, if police are willing to lie about what they saw or, you know, in the cases of some rogue officers, they may exist, but this rule isn't going to prevent -- no rule is going to prevent that."
2013.12-9490,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3457.802,3458.419,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3460.971,3469.477,In this case we're talking about a single uncorroborated tip of reckless driving.
2013.12-9490,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3560.568,3582.933,"Well, I find that unsatisfactory because if you -- unless you're willing to say it doesn't matter whether it's a bomb, an atomic bomb, a little bomb, then there -- there must be -- if you're going to draw the line someplace, then you're going to have to distinguish between those reports of crimes that are serious enough to be on one side of the line and those reports of a crime that are not serious enough to be on that side of the line."
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3588.768,3595.091,"Well, Your Honor, except I don't think -- I don't think you can draw the line in terms of reasonable suspicion because then, you're going to have this--"
2013.12-9490,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3595.091,3595.491,All right.
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3597.943,3599.359,"--Well, certainly, Your Honor--"
2013.12-9490,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3599.359,3604.43,"You can say it can never done, even if it's an atomic bomb, even if it's some other type of bomb."
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3612.868,3619.539,"--Your Honor, I think the line is certainly, when we get into the bomb situation, but not in terms of reasonable suspicion."
2013.12-9490,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3627.043,3627.462,For a bomb.
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3628.828,3631.447,"Well, I don't think -- I think if -- if there's a call in that--"
2013.12-9490,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3631.447,3632.047,It has to be a big bomb.
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3632.047,3640.72,"--that says a white -- a white Prius has a bomb, you know, that doesn't seem to be the sort of case under the -- under the circumstances where this Court would find a reasonable suspicion."
2013.12-9490,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3640.72,3644.338,What about drawing the line at intentional conduct?
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3647.407,3648.042,Well--
2013.12-9490,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3648.042,3662.383,"Or maybe intentionally doing action that is going to harm more than one person, as opposed to, hmm, maybe this person might accidentally, because he's inebriated, hurt somebody?"
2013.12-9490,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3673.474,3674.407,"I have another one, too."
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3674.407,3692.636,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think those -- those are two significant distinctions, certainly, between the -- the bomb analogy and the situation, even in the drunken driving situation, where you don't have anybody who is intentionally trying to harm anyone and the magnitude of the risk is -- is much greater."
2013.12-9490,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3692.886,3698.204,"So somebody has five drinks and goes and gets in the car, that's not intentionally trying to harm someone?"
2013.12-9490,3,38062,paul_r_kleven,,3699.137,3703.939,"--Well, in terms of their -- their decision to get drunk, there's intent there."
2013.12-9490,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3722.569,3723.552,"--Thank you, counsel."
