1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,0.0,8.769,"72, in which 59 respondents were elected as delegates to the 1972 Convention."
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,159.719,161.411,Who are the respondents?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,161.411,166.333,The respondents are the 59 delegates selected in accordance with the Illinois Election Code.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.333,168.216,The delegates themselves?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,168.216,170.867,They were the delegates that were elected according to the Illinois law.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,171.511,174.069,Right.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,175.22,185.349,"In late June 1972, petitioners held caucuses throughout the City of Chicago in which they selected an alternative delegation."
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,206.632,211.065,Are the 59 petitioners include any of the 59 respondents who elect?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,211.065,211.785,"No, they do not."
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,564.389,579.344,In the -- under Illinois law do that delegation at that stage have any authority or power other than the election of the members of the National Party Committee?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,579.344,580.154,That was the --
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,580.154,582.957,Or have all of their other functions expired?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,582.957,589.015,All of their functions had expired with the exception of the power to select the National Committee Men and Committee Women.
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,589.015,596.274,Is the -- are the delegates then discharged once that function is performed?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,596.274,596.966,"No, they're not."
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.744,602.055,Until the next convention?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,602.055,603.68,Until the next convention.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,603.68,607.625,Or the next file reading?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,615.229,616.891,There will be another primary Your Honor.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,623.65,635.615,"Well, what I'm trying to get at is if the Illinois appellate court is correct and then under Illinois law there would be another election where they're not a delegate?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,635.615,649.964,"The Illinois appellate court simply sustained the injunction of the Cook County Court which prohibited petitioners from acting in anyway its delegates, for holding themselves out as delegates."
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,649.964,657.819,"But the respondents act as delegates only until they're replace under Illinois law by another election, isn't that true?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,657.819,658.623,That's correct.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,658.623,660.986,And that will be when?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,660.986,664.828,The next primary election will be in March of 1976.
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,664.828,674.863,"I thought you said, until another election and until that election had been acknowledged and approve by the National Party Convention."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,674.863,678.044,If I didn't say that I certainly meant to imply that Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,678.044,683.61,In the meantime the people elected are merely delegate designates --
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,683.61,685.852,By the state of Illinois.
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.852,690.738,And they remain in that posture until their credentials are accepted by the convention?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,690.738,699.534,"On the other hand, the petitioners are the certified delegates to the convention and have the credentials which have been granted by the National Party."
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.534,712.731,"Mr. Whalen, we've certainly taken jurisdiction of some cases where there's been an appeal from an injunction without any contempt citation where the party has yet to disobey the injunction."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,742.554,746.212,"There are two injunctions involved, Your Honor."
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.111,761.805,"Now, what practical effect does that injunction have in your clients at this time?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,761.805,774.239,"It is preventing the clients from holding a meeting, selecting a National Committee Man and Committee Women -- woman from Chicago --from Illinois and presenting them to the Democratic National Committee."
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.239,776.897,What -- does that come every two years?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,776.897,785.061,That comes up under National Party rules as a duty and responsibility of the certified delegates from each state.
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.061,789.752,Would the National Committee Man or Committee Woman and doesn't have any particular term?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,789.752,791.111,It's a four-year term.
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.111,794.568,"Well, when was the -- when were they elected last in Illinois?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,794.568,802.174,"Respondents participated in an election because petitioners were enjoined on August 5, 1972."
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.625,819.784,And by that time there'll be new delegates by anybody's rule?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,819.784,822.109,That's correct.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,822.109,827.591,I get it then at the National Committee Men suppose is filled now --
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,827.591,828.451,It is Your Honor.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,828.451,829.723,And Committee Woman?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,829.723,830.962,It is -- it is filled --
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,830.962,834.747,And then did the -- did the National Committee accept those --
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,834.747,835.039,It accepted --
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.039,836.767,Those elections by respondents?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,836.767,839.024,It accepted them subject to challenge.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.863,849.129,"Let's assume that you win this case, what will happen with respect to the National Committee Man and Woman?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,849.129,856.175,The petitioners will hold a meeting which they were enjoined from holding by the August 2nd Order.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,940.104,941.467,"Mr. Whalen, may I just interrupt you."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,941.467,941.684,Yes.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,941.684,946.239,If I may get back to you about a matter of the Committee Men and Committee Women.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,951.41,953.701,"On July 5, 1972."
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.701,955.875,And that what was before the National Convention was?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,955.875,956.908,And that was after the --
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,956.908,958.173,"Well, that was --"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,958.173,959.943,"It was August 5, 1972?"
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,959.943,961.306,But after the National Convention.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,961.306,963.386,After the National Convention.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,965.254,968.953,Are they now seated by the National Committee or in office?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,968.953,971.203,They are seated subject to challenge.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,971.203,973.036,Subject to challenge before whom?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,973.036,974.926,The Democratic National Committee.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,974.926,978.322,"Well, has the National Committee permitted them to participate in National Committee?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,978.322,979.414,"Yes, they have."
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,979.414,980.234,Subject to challenge?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,980.234,980.766,Yes.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,980.766,983.027,And what is the Committee going to rule on the challenge?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,983.027,987.886,The committee can't rule on the challenge because the petitioners are currently enjoined from bringing it.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.886,988.51,I see.
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,988.51,991.159,The state court.
1974.73-1106,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.159,994.365,I thought this case was moot.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,998.514,1005.27,"I might say, Your Honor that it's a continuing reoccurring question which is inevitably will arise at the last minute just as this case."
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.27,1011.961,"With Democrats, its sure will."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1011.961,1018.328,I said before that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia expressly held that all the parties were the same.
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.668,1074.464,It was a subsequent vacation of by the Court of Appeals of its judgment?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1074.464,1079.823,"The Court of Appeals did not vacate its judgment, Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.137,1112.294,Would you concede that after the vacation of the judgment in the Court of Appeals by this Court that that judgment was no longer in effect?
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1203.777,1218.063,Are there any cases in the state courts other than the two that you've mentioned in this period in which the power of the National Convention to seek their own delegates' passed on credentials have been questioned?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1218.063,1223.093,The two reported cases where the McQueen case and the Houser case which are in our brief --
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1223.093,1225.16,"Any, any beside those --"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1225.16,1225.254,You --
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.254,1226.829,Beside those two.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1226.829,1237.582,"Mr. Chief Justice, you're aware of a lower court decision in the State of Georgia which purported to pass on the credentials of the -- which was lawfully elected delegation from Georgia."
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1237.582,1243.18,Did that go to the Supreme Court of Georgia or was that in the intermediate and lower court?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1243.18,1246.05,That was in the intermediate and lower courts.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1303.154,1307.214,"Mr. Whalen, what is the -- what's the federal question here?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1311.558,1322.903,"Your Honor, the complaint by its terms does not raise a federal question and indeed that was established by Judge Will in the Seventh Circuit on respondent's motion to remand."
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1334.967,1336.223,By the State of Illinois.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1336.223,1338.483,By the State of Illinois.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.587,1374.536,"Well, that the same as your first point and your first and second."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1374.536,1375.052,I think that's right.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.052,1381.672,I mean the National Chamber of Commerce is national in nature and the state presumably can interfere with the right of those people to associate.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1381.672,1382.089,That's right.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.384,1403.624,"Not a federal governmental interest that is there, is there?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1407.889,1410.843,It is a private associational interest but to the --
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1410.843,1414.391,"Of course the Court of Appeals, I know it held it was governmental."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1414.391,1420.316,"But if there's to be any regulation, it certainly has to be federal, it couldn't be stayed."
1974.73-1106,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.316,1425.538,Do you feel you have a fundamental right to travel to the National Convention?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1425.538,1435.455,We certainly do but I don't think that's what it -- what's at stake here because the injunction order did not prohibit us from traveling by its terms.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.852,1453.611,Your basic claim is that the State of Illinois through this injunction has interfered with your First and Fourteenth Amendment right of association.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1453.611,1454.826,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1106,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1454.826,1457.297,Outside of the State of Illinois?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1457.297,1458.738,Yes.
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.782,1494.99,What if the -- what you're suggesting also I suppose that conventions have no business or political parties do have the business of saying how delegates to their convention could be elected if they're going to be given credentials?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1494.99,1495.31,Yes.
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.707,1504.866,"You could say, I suppose according to you that the party could say delegates must be chosen in the convention process rather than by election?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1504.866,1505.784,That is correct.
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.784,1512.9,And the state has no -- would have no business insisting that delegates be elected rather than chosen on convention?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1512.9,1513.549,That is correct.
1974.73-1106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1513.549,1518.589,"Well, as a matter fact I gather you go so far as to say the states have absolutely no role to play."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1521.879,1522.353,"I, I--"
1974.73-1106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1522.353,1525.438,The procedures and methods by which these delegates will be elected?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1525.438,1529.948,I don't think -- I don't think we need to reach that decision here.
1974.73-1106,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1535.86,1536.582,"Well, that's alright."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1541.183,1550.121,It might not be if a constitutional questions were presented which are not involved in this case or if there were federal regulation which is not involved --
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.121,1558.521,On the other hand the convention has no business interfering with the state's constitutional prerogatives with respect to the selection of electors?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1558.521,1559.312,"That is correct, other than --"
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.312,1561.137,"They're not involved here, are they?"
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1561.137,1563.782,"Electors are not involved and other than, to the extent --"
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.782,1570.952,And the state needed I suppose except the parties -- the results of the parties work at the National Convention?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1570.952,1573.3,And as you know Your Honor that has repeatedly happened.
1974.73-1106,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.3,1575.484,Yes.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1575.484,1582.325,"In -- to support the injunction in this case, the respondents had argued that there's a compelling state interest."
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1652.164,1664.124,"The only impact of decision here, am I correct, as to the immediate situation would be the identity of the members of the National Committee from state."
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1675.749,1696.494,"There's that -- there's also the problem that if persons wanting to participate in a National Convention can have injunctions issued against them and if the judgments are subsequently reversed but those individuals have to stand for contempt, that's certainly will chill in the future any First Amendment rights or incentive to bring this kind of --"
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1696.494,1709.357,I was excluding the consequences just the present ones.Decision of this Court now would decide who which body is going to elect the National Committee members from the State of Illinois.
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1709.357,1710.953,It will decide that.
1974.73-1106,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.889,1719.962,He will also decide whether or not your clients are going to jail?
1974.73-1106,0,46467,wayne_w_whalen,,1719.962,1721.864,That's correct.
1974.73-1106,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.864,1727.77,It's also a future.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,1732.001,1736.486,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.137,2081.714,"The point is I guess that the federal litigation culminating in this Court's stay was not concerned with the legality under Illinois law of your slate and on the other side of the coin, that this case is not concerned with the constitutional legitimacy of the Democratic Party's guidelines."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2081.714,2083.011,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.485,2084.777,Into the --
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2084.777,2090.812,In this case and in fact at the outset of the hearing before District Judge Hart.
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2121.079,2128.661,Was it open to respondents to raise the question of the legality of the petitioner's slate before Judge Hart in that proceeding?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2128.661,2130.005,No one raised it.
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2130.005,2131.299,"Was it -- No, that wasn't my question."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2131.299,2131.92,"No, no, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2131.92,2133.581,Was it open to you to raise it?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2133.581,2134.42,"No sir, Your Honor."
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.152,2135.921,Why not?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2135.921,2139.767,Judge Hart specifically precluded that question.
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2139.767,2141.875,"Did you attempt to open it, to raise it?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2141.875,2143.939,"Well, when we came in Your Honor."
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.429,2156.778,Does that imply the lack of bona fides of the petitioner's brief?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2156.778,2157.633,No.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2192.266,2192.902,Alright.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2192.902,2195.012,National Party.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.012,2206.941,"Now in the present case, at least as I understand it, it's virtually conceded that your clients were the delegates chosen in accordance with Illinois law."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2206.941,2207.255,Not only --
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2207.255,2210.278,"I don't think there's a -- as I understand it, there's no dispute about that."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2210.278,2210.318,There's --
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.318,2226.444,The question is -- the basic question in this case is whether the injunction of the Illinois state court violated the petitioners' constitutional rights of free association --
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2226.444,2226.563,Correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2226.563,2228.492,Is that about it?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2228.492,2229.441,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2229.441,2233.89,And that was an issue that was not really of -- was not the issue in the previous federal litigation.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2233.89,2234.265,That's correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.265,2235.847,That's your point.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2235.847,2241.39,It was not an issue nor with defense which might give rise to a decision before the Court.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.611,2622.39,Foisted upon the people of Illinois or upon the Democratic Convention?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2622.39,2628.024,"It was upon the nine, I believe its nine congressional districts involved, Your Honor."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2628.024,2635.189,But the question is as to whether they shall be seated not as to whether they shall be or how they should be elected in Illinois?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2635.189,2635.585,I think your --
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.585,2636.814,"Well, may I finish."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2636.814,2638.375,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.375,2642.734,Or whether they shall be seated at the Democratic Convention.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2651.417,2652.498,"No, sir"
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2652.498,2653.519,Am I right?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2653.519,2654.9,They cannot refuse to sit them.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2654.9,2656.066,"Oh, they can't."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2656.066,2658.172,I believe that was Powell versus McCormack.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2658.172,2662.875,"Powell no, that was no seating."
1974.73-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2662.875,2674.564,Have there not been a number of occasions in history when Congress refused to seat a member elected by a particular district in a particular state?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2674.564,2675.968,"My recollection, Your Honor --"
1974.73-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2675.968,2678.533,And it does not in more such cases.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2701.714,2708.358,"He may have been refused his seat, Your Honor but I don't think people were chosen in his place by Congress."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2720.401,2722.861,I didn't say that.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2722.861,2723.054,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.054,2725.26,I've said that there were instance where the --
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2725.26,2725.662,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2725.662,2729.303,"The State had exercise its rights at all, is it?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2729.303,2729.499,Correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.499,2737.03,And in this case the State exercised its rights and I thought convention was asserting its rights.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2737.03,2738.609,Correct Your Honor and I don't --
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2738.609,2740.424,And if that's what happened.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2740.424,2741.526,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.526,2743.846,That a convention refuse to sit him.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2743.846,2744.275,Correct!
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.911,2766.219,Even if the democratic convention recognizes this as such.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2766.219,2768.386,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.386,2768.738,Your point is?
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.738,2771.669,With the long arm statute really is it?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2771.669,2793.309,"Well, it maybe a long arm statute, Your Honor, but to say anything else of course, would be to negate the idea of popular elections of delegates nor do I think, Your Honor that is consistent with any great interest of the convention."
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.879,2816.403,"Your point, I gather with the respect to the reported congressional analogy is that it is not an analogy that's your not complaining at all here of the convention's refusal to sit the Illinois -- your clients."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2816.403,2817.162,Correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.162,2818.552,"At all, that's not an issue here at all?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2818.552,2819.491,"No, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2907.915,2912.522,"What about the question that Mr. Justice White put to Mr. Whalen, Mr. Torshen?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2930.124,2932.165,I think they could say that Your Honor.
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2943.422,2945.649,"But then, what about the answer to this question?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2946.237,2947.336,They could say that.
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2947.571,2949.431,And make it stick?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2949.431,2950.354,"Well, they could --"
1974.73-1106,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2950.354,2951.796,They wouldn't seat the delegate?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2951.796,2952.769,Sure.
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.769,2955.773,But your point is I guess that they can't seat anybody else either?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2955.773,2956.465,I suppose --
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.465,2957.294,"Is that, is that your point?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2957.294,2958.186,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.186,2963.411,So that if you concede divided the convention that they must concede the state's right?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2963.411,2964.97,We concede the right of the convention.
1974.73-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.622,2971.745,That would be its remedy.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2971.745,2971.776,Right.
1974.73-1106,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.776,2972.471,So you don't get a spot on that --
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2972.471,2973.081,Right.
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.542,3031.338,"Together if that it is -- we sustain your view here what or if your view would have been followed in 1972, Illinois would not have had delegates at the convention."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3031.338,3032.79,That's conceivable Your Honor.
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.605,3033.78,Sure.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3039.698,3041.434,Right.
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.044,3070.192,So you say the state has a -- the party hasn't got the right to say who is going to represent the --
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3070.192,3070.395,Correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.395,3074.184,They can reject your delegates but they can't do anything else.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3074.184,3074.957,Correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.704,3087.682,So that if you have a convention under the proposed party rules in the state you'd have the injunction and stop them from going to the National Convention?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3087.682,3103.174,"If the state selection system has not been referred to a state party as it has been in some states and if the state selection system is it was in Illinois, a popular election which is free and open to all."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.35,3122.355,"My question is, they have a state convention with the State of Illinois says is not lawful under the state law and they elect delegates to the National Convention in the Pudong, outside the State Illinois."
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3127.313,3127.755,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3127.755,3130.55,How under what rule or law do you get that?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3130.55,3145.939,"Not enjoin them from going there, not enjoin them from participating, not enjoining them from serving on convention committees by enjoining them from representing the electorate as delegates, Your Honor."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.939,3148.534,"Well, what does that mean?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3148.534,3148.564,Well --
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3148.564,3149.985,They go to the convention.
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3159.167,3178.31,"In the Mississippi challenges earlier Your Honor, what the convention did was create positions of delegate at large for certain of the members of the Mississippi delegation and I suppose here, if the convention really wanted this particular group, they could have created offices for them."
1974.73-1106,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3178.31,3193.905,But is it right as the State of Illinois has to control the internal affairs of a National Party Convention held outside of the State of Illinois?
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3193.905,3212.575,"The State of Illinois, we would submit Your Honor, has a right to protect its own election laws and its own electorate which participated in an election held under the offices of the State of Illinois."
1974.73-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3224.69,3226.492,"Well, these men could go down to the convention?"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3226.492,3227.048,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.365,3234.899,"And vote and do everything they wanted to but when they get back to Illinois, they might have a little problem with being in contempt to Court --"
1974.73-1106,1,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,3234.899,3235.665,That's correct.
1974.73-1106,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3275.308,3301.186,"If this hypothetical situation that we were just talking about that is these delegates go to the convention in violation of the state court injunctions, take their seats, perform all their functions, come back or cited for and found him in contempt, would the traditional remedies of federal habeas corpus be open to them?"
