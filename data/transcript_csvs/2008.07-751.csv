2008.07-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We will hear argument next in case 07-751, Pearson v. Callahan."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,7.187,35.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the time of the arrest in this case there were three different Federal circuits and two State courts that established it was Constitutionally permissible for police officers to enter a home without a warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest after an illegal drug transaction when a government agent had occurred and probable cause had been established."
2008.07-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,80.618,85.939,"Well, because the Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well established?"
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,96.878,104.15,"No, certainly we think that the generality of just pure consent is not the level at which it should be determined."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,131.05,134.085,"Well, it seems to me that misses the point of the case."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,170.592,178.012,"Justice Souter, we are not -- we are not contending this is an implied consent case, although that has been a theory that has been advanced in the lower courts."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,191.506,204.73,"No, but that -- that equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the government agent, which in this case is not a police officer, but a confidential informant, with a police officer."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,224.727,225.46,Absolutely.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,226.527,228.179,And there is no clear law on that.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,238.987,240.537,"--There are two points, Justice Souter."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.489,250.558,"Well, first -- I want to hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at that time there was one case that held the equivalence?"
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,250.558,251.342,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,260.581,261.533,"Which was not a circuit case, right?"
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,261.533,262.4,--That is a circuit case.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,262.4,262.966,District case?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,262.966,265.168,"That was a circuit court case, U.S. v. Pollard."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.168,270.722,So there were three circuit court holdings that the confidential informant was equivalent to a police officer?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,270.722,272.656,There were three out of the Seventh Circuit.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,285.066,287.868,"Okay, did you -- now, do you have other circuits that held that?"
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,287.868,288.551,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.885,292.869,Where is Pollard from?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,292.869,293.552,--Sixth Circuit.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.552,294.121,Sixth.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,294.121,299.306,And they cited in support the confidential informant cases from the Seventh Circuit.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.453,317.737,Okay.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,323.439,339.948,"Well, fundamentally -- and of course the test for Fourth Amendments purposes is the Skinner test -- that once you are a government agent or a government actor, there really is no material difference in terms what the confidential informant would do or the undercover police officer would do."
2008.07-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.948,374.204,"Oh, but there is an enormous difference between the training and the character of a police officer and, as this very case illustrates, the confidential informants are often very shady characters who can't be counted on to be truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get someone for the police, because in most cases they are seeking to have their own case dealt with sympathetically."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,390.147,390.931,Two points.
2008.07-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.603,400.272,How about this one?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,406.593,409.295,This one clearly had a drug problem.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,417.9,421.535,He was trying -- and he was trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,421.535,423.97,"--Well, there is no question about that."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.812,457.025,"But you -- you certainly cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the integrity to be expected from a confidential informant, taking that as a category of law including all sorts of informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a police officer."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,457.025,461.893,"--Well, as a general proposition, Justice Souter, you can't make that kind of determination."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,462.679,463.479,Why can't I?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,463.479,469.333,--Because sometimes confidential informants are retired police officers; sometimes confidential informants are police cadets.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,471.451,478.105,"Then if that -- if that is true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good to the bad."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,488.461,491.263,--I wouldn't want to make that statement.
2008.07-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.076,526.02,"There's one feature of this is that I think is really puzzling: What this case is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,579.22,588.66,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the officers testified why they didn't get a warrant, 244-245 in the joint appendix, and 256 and 257."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.98,599.016,We're talking about probable cause.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,609.138,612.174,I am only going on the record and what these informed officers testified to.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.174,613.776,But we're asking for the basis.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,634.07,635.439,"Well, it is."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,644.545,646.497,They don't even need an anticipatory warrant.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,665.624,675.647,"--Justice -- Justice Souter, I don't believe at the time, approximately 9 o'clock in the evening, the police had probable cause to believe the drugs were there."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,675.647,681.134,An informant just came out and said there were drugs there and they don't have probable cause?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,681.134,686.872,"At the time of 9 o'clock, I don't think it was established that there were drugs--"
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,686.872,688.324,Why not?
2008.07-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,688.324,692.776,"I thought it was established not only that there were drugs, but that he actually tasted some."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,692.776,694.144,--He never told the police that.
2008.07-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,694.844,695.411,But--
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,695.411,700.446,"--The purpose of the operation, of course, was to establish that there was in fact drugs in the house."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.336,716.407,The reason the police are being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,738.988,744.224,"Well, as I -- as I explained before, they believed the drugs in--"
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.224,746.259,I'm not interested in what they personally believed.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,754.013,756.199,"--We don't believe they did, Your Honor."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.151,758.651,That is--
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,758.651,759.301,--an anticipatory warrant.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,759.301,764.471,--I will admit that is the most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in this courtroom.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,765.538,770.559,"Well, the record evidence doesn't substantiate that, or they would have gotten--"
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.559,771.059,Why doesn't it?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,771.059,772.161,--Or they would have gotten a warrant.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,772.161,772.794,Why doesn't it?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,790.205,798.359,"Because the police did not believe that at the time that they could have gotten a warrant, that the drugs would not have been dissipated."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,799.477,801.227,Is that a reasonable belief?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,801.227,802.179,--Pardon me?
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.179,808.667,"I mean, we're talking about probable cause, not an establishment of mathematical certainty."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,808.667,809.5,Here's another point.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.442,828.58,They clearly would have been if they had sent a police officer in.
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,847.808,858.433,In rural Utah -- and this is page 47 of the joint appendix -- the officers testified that one of the reasons why they need to use confidential informants is because the police are all known.
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.218,865.42,Then why didn't they use the confidential informant to get a warrant?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,865.42,871.157,"--Well, I don't know how I can answer the question any more than I have, Justice Souter."
2008.07-751,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.157,871.907,That doesn't--
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,871.907,878.846,"They -- they chose not to, for reasons they didn't believe they had probable cause and they were concerned that the drugs had been dissipated."
2008.07-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,878.846,889.119,"Counsel, in every -- given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on the underlying constitutional question, you do not have to prove that you are right; isn't that correct?"
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,893.254,894.689,That's correct.
2008.07-751,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.362,931.079,--May I just establish one thing?
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,967.052,967.537,--That's true.
2008.07-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,990.75,991.402,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-751,0,38350,peter_stirba,,991.402,998.59,Thank you.
2008.07-751,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,998.59,1002.058,Mr. Stewart.
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1002.058,1012.016,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The police entry in this case was constitutional and, in any event, did not infringe any constitutional right that was clearly established at the time the officers acted."
2008.07-751,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1064.949,1068.834,"Mr. Stewart, could I follow up on one other thing that came up during the preceding argument?"
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1089.647,1090.197,That's correct.
2008.07-751,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1116.565,1134.343,"But if our question is should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine that covers the confidential informant in this case, one question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to recognize that broad a consent doctrine?"
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1153.055,1155.84,We certainly think that they had probable cause.
2008.07-751,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.34,1185.526,That's -- it's not just this case.
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1221.734,1232.757,"--Well, I -- I would think that with either police officers or with informants you could have some situations in which the undercover operative has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of drugs."
2008.07-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.257,1311.792,"Mr. Stewart, could I interrupt you, because there is something that hasn't been reached."
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1318.296,1329.854,"--We think that this Court in this case should address the constitutional question first because it is the subject of the square circuit conflict, it's been briefed and argued, it's a question that independently warrants resolution."
2008.07-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1329.854,1330.621,It is quite difficult.
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1369.998,1370.331,Well--
2008.07-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1370.331,1375.401,"And if it's easier to deal with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the rest of it."
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1375.401,1397.565,"--I guess the first thing I would say in response to that is we think that the -- the balance or the way in which discretion will ordinarily be exercised will typically be different in the case of the lower courts than in the case of this Court, because the principal role of the lower Federal courts is to decide individual cases before them usually in the most expeditious and noncontroversial way where they--"
2008.07-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.565,1402.635,"I see that, but unless we do that here, they are never going to get the right message."
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1428.786,1430.019,"--Well, I think they will get the message--"
2008.07-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1430.019,1432.238,"We don't always have to do it, but I mean once."
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1432.238,1444.129,"--I think they will get the message if the Court tells them that the mandatory rule of Saucier is no longer in effect, that courts have discretion to decide based on their sound judgment whether it is--"
2008.07-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1444.129,1456.537,"Why isn't it -- why isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional?"
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1460.321,1474.665,"--I mean, in one sense it's an advisory opinion, but in another sense there are -- there are often cases in which two alternative grounds for a decision are proffered, either one of which, if accepted, would compel a judgment in one litigant's favor."
2008.07-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1478.719,1479.119,"No, no."
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1500.715,1511.606,"--Well, it's true that if the Court announced that this search was constitutional, that it would necessarily be saying: And there was no clearly established constitutional law to the contrary at the time the officers acted."
2008.07-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1511.973,1513.556,--to the question.
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1537.59,1541.392,--But that -- that would be equally true in the case of the undercover police officer.
2008.07-751,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.392,1543.242,"Well, maybe they both should be the same."
2008.07-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1543.811,1547.713,"That's what I wanted to know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier."
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1570.626,1570.926,No.
2008.07-751,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.75,1594.824,But isn't the reason it's insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind of situation in which one officer's knowledge is regarded as another officer's knowledge.
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1607.818,1616.424,"I think you don't have that precise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the undercover operative here, the informant, was a State actor."
2008.07-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1629.897,1645.074,"Just -- just to be clear, if -- if I may, I know your red light is on: Your position is if an undercover officer is in the premises and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can invite police in to assist him in making an arrest without exigent circumstances?"
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1645.074,1645.476,That's correct.
2008.07-751,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1645.476,1646.759,What's -- what do I read?
2008.07-751,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1649.395,1652.43,I don't think this -- this Court has ever squarely so held.
2008.07-751,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1662.053,1662.753,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1668.106,1676.045,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case about consent."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1701.529,1711.901,"YOU -- was Mr. Stewart correct that you concede that if this person entering the house were in fact a police officer, that this would have been okay?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1711.901,1712.618,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.363,1733.631,"Well, you would agree he could make the -- the arrest by himself."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1734.714,1734.964,--Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.964,1736.047,--he could make the arrest by himself.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1736.047,1736.666,--he could make the arrest by himself.
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1737.333,1744.67,But -- and -- but you are saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest effective in all cases.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1746.605,1747.189,--Correct.
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1757.912,1762.031,"You are advocating a rule that is going to get police officers killed, aren't they -- aren't you?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1780.493,1793.836,"Of course, the safest thing for him would be to simply withdraw, get on the telephone, and get a warrant to come back in, or during the two hours that they were planning this entry he could have gotten a warrant then or an anticipatory warrant."
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1796.287,1801.875,"Well, it seems to me that in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are exigent circumstances."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1801.875,1805.643,"Well, to the extent they planned it in advance, and the basis of their entry--"
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1805.643,1809.845,"Well, that -- that's a different point and I have some question about that."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1814.499,1831.378,"--Well, if they -- if they planned on an exigent circumstance as being the reason that they are allowed to go in, under this Court's decision -- the long line of decisions in Payton and Steagald saying exigent circumstances or consent are the way to get in without a warrant, then it would not be permissible."
2008.07-751,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.711,1833.944,Imagining -- you are imagining different cases.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1891.0,1893.867,--I think certainly in this case there were not exigent circumstances.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1931.058,1934.926,That's a tough -- at least I find it a very difficult question.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1978.371,1982.323,"With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's a difficult question."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1982.323,1983.857,"Well, I know you don't because you are arguing one side of it."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,1999.885,2013.593,"Well, with regard to the Saucier question, we think the Court should keep the Saucier question, and particularly in this case where there is a circuit split, the court should decide the constitutional question and not move on to the clearly established question--"
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2013.593,2017.246,"Why, because we need to provide guidance on that question?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2017.246,2018.03,--Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.03,2021.382,"Well, do you think it can't come up any other way?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2021.382,2022.484,It certainly could come up--
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.484,2022.934,Yes.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2022.934,2024.2,--in a criminal case.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.2,2027.352,"Or a -- or a suit against the political subdivision, right?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2033.69,2034.292,Certainly.
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2037.944,2042.746,"It seems to me that this is an area where the police do need guidance, and I need guidance."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2052.87,2056.322,"--Well, this Court in Payton and Steagald--"
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2056.322,2058.006,Which is what they do in Saucier.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2058.006,2059.607,--I didn't hear the Justice's questions.
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.607,2062.392,Which is what they would do under Saucier.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2062.392,2063.275,Right.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.402,2077.969,"Well, but that was my question."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2124.716,2130.887,"--Well, that would take us to back before Saucier, the Court -- it's a recent decision that hasn't been proven to be unworkable."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2132.187,2145.077,"Well, but my point though is that at least in my experience it was unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to decide not just a factual question but a constitutional question in a context where it wasn't necessary."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2145.077,2147.577,"--Well, it depends on your view of necessity."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2166.291,2172.061,Doesn't the fact that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean that it's not clearly established?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2172.061,2188.987,"--Well, this Court has looked to controlling -- its own precedents and controlling circuit law to decide what is -- what law is clearly established, and here, Payton and Steagald the courts held that there is a bright-line rule that's very simple for police officers, it's easy for them to understand."
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2213.805,2225.362,"What if -- what if the officers in this case had read the Seventh Circuit decision, and they said these are judges on the United States Court of Appeals, and they think this is consistent with the Fourth Amendment?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2242.824,2252.847,"Well, I think the officers in the Tenth Circuit need to be aware the way that our Federal court system works, and the Seventh Circuit decision isn't binding on the Tenth Circuit."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2281.865,2296.042,"If the Tenth Circuit says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is that clearly established that it's not allowed in the Tenth Circuit?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2296.042,2296.525,Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.718,2311.818,Then it is irrelevant.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2316.02,2319.638,"--Well, that very well might wind up in this Court if--"
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.638,2322.507,"Well, right, but do the police officers get to decide that?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2332.73,2340.385,"--Well, we don't expect officers to survey the entire case law and come up with a law professor's view of whether this is reasonable or not."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.655,2407.677,Do any of the other cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve confidential informants as opposed to police officers?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2407.677,2409.127,Other than the Seventh Circuit?
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2409.127,2409.777,Yes.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2409.777,2417.866,The -- one case in the Sixth Circuit there was both a confidential informant and a police officer were admitted.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2424.87,2438.963,"So at the time every circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police officer and a confidential informant, I think that could be considered a police officer because he is going to call the police in -- every court of appeals decision involving a confidential informant said it was okay."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2438.963,2443.184,Actually we have cited three circuits where these same facts happened.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2446.569,2453.29,"And in those circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between the police officer and the confidential informant?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2453.29,2454.223,"Well, no."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2463.994,2472.564,"Do you believe that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to look at in addressing this question, a case involving a confidential informant?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2472.564,2483.539,I think the appropriate level of generality is that the facts under the court -- the court has covered the field when it comes to warrantless home entries.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2493.144,2493.944,Why is that?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2493.944,2495.679,That's a good question.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2495.679,2502.916,"Why isn't it that the issue hasn't come up, this question of a confidential informant is one that hasn't come up?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2505.868,2510.689,"Well, the Court's language is presumptively unconstitutional has said that many times."
2008.07-751,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.689,2533.952,"You are talking about the main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I think the Court has said a number of times to make this search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if you want to interject the judicial between police and the person in jeopardy."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2545.01,2546.362,Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.362,2550.147,This Court has gotten from the Constitution?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2550.147,2550.78,Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2550.78,2552.699,Get a warrant if you can.
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2552.699,2579.166,"Isn't your argument that in a situation where the exigent circumstances are the creation of the scenario that the police have set up, the police cannot -- and you have a police officer who is being the undercover operative who has the power to make an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for other officers to come in and assist with the arrest?"
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2579.166,2584.57,"Well, our position is that would be -- the additional officer entry would violate the Constitution--"
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2584.57,2588.855,The additional officers would -- that would violate the Fourth Amendment?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2588.855,2589.422,--Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2589.422,2591.891,Even if there is an officer safety problem there?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2591.891,2598.811,"Well, to the extent that they have created an officer safety problem, obviously the officers are going to go in to help him, no one is going to get hurt."
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.614,2605.566,"So the police say, you know, we made a mistake."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2612.887,2614.006,"No, of course, they can send assistance."
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.156,2615.522,No.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2619.208,2623.362,"--Yes, they have, which is why the additional officer's entry would violate the Fourth Amendment."
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2625.228,2627.73,So -- so my first statement was correct.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2633.051,2638.038,"--Yes, my answer was as a practical matter no -- no police officer is going to leave, even if--"
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2638.038,2640.323,"No, but then he is going to get sued."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2640.323,2646.393,--He very well may get sued and there are questions of fact as to--
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2646.393,2655.416,And you say as a practical matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can endanger -- we must endanger the officer?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2655.416,2657.616,"--Well, I disagree that the officer could be in danger--"
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.616,2658.118,"No, no."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2667.974,2669.843,--They did create the exigent circumstance--
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2669.843,2681.983,"It seems to me that dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on your proposition that if the police create the exigent circumstances, they cannot rely on it."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2684.852,2690.922,"--Even if -- even if you disagree with me on that, it shouldn't make any difference in this case where there was no exigent circumstances."
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2690.922,2691.306,"No, no."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2692.722,2693.958,Okay.
2008.07-751,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2696.66,2704.814,"You want us to write an opinion saying that any time police create the exigent circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had the time to get a warrant."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2708.365,2714.769,"--I don't think you would need to to write the opinion that would say that, because exigent circumstances are not in this case."
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.769,2737.783,"Mr. Metzler, what do you say to this line of reasoning, we have in prior cases adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is also the knowledge of all police officers, at least within a department or working on a particular problem."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2820.087,2826.443,"Well, if you are to adopt that sort of -- I think you certainly could adopt that rationale."
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2841.133,2848.772,"No, you are absolutely right in terms of his psychological process, the only person he has invited in is the one person."
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2875.357,2878.642,"--Again, I don't think that the way to get there is through consent."
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2892.218,2901.741,It would be consent to one officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2901.741,2902.107,Yes.
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.107,2903.307,That's what we would be doing.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2926.539,2930.657,That would be -- that would certainly be a basis to allow for police officers.
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2930.657,2936.811,"Would it not open the door to, I guess, to what you are objecting to?"
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2936.811,2939.013,Why would probable cause solve the problem at all?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2951.07,2953.253,"No, I think they do have probable cause."
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2961.757,2962.192,Right.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2988.759,2989.276,You certainly could--
2008.07-751,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2989.276,2990.709,That -- that's my proposal.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,2990.709,2999.865,"--You certainly could adopt that rule, and that would be a -- an additional reason for police to enter beyond what has been thus far established by this Court."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.865,3004.817,How do you decide whether the confidential informant should be considered an employee of the police?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,3015.541,3018.827,I don't think his employment status is -- is what is at issue.
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.671,3041.34,Why doesn't -- that doesn't make him an agent of the police?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,3041.34,3042.675,"No, I don't think so."
2008.07-751,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3048.346,3059.135,What is it there is a State statute that says that confidential informants may be designated by the police department to assist in making arrests?
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,3059.135,3072.127,"If there was some assist to making an arrest -- of the government, then assuming we are following Justice Souter's new exception, then I think that they would fall into that exception."
2008.07-751,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3079.948,3081.733,He wasn't acting on his own.
2008.07-751,2,43084,theodore_p_metzler_jr,,3091.871,3092.256,"--Well, that's true."
2008.07-751,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3114.669,3134.416,"Even if there is such a thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this record that -- that they do not want confidential informers to go making arrests, so that the police distinguish the confidential informer."
