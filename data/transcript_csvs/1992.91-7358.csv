1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.789,"We'll hear argument now in 91-7358, Todd A. Brecht v. Gordon A. Abrahamson."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,12.391,15.61,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,57.437,59.455,So it isn't a Fifth Amendment case.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,59.455,60.705,Not primarily.
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,64.64,66.74,Which is Doyle... which is Doyle.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,66.74,71.458,--The promise that was made to him could have been any promise.
1992.91-7358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.583,246.189,"Mr. Shoenberger, he wasn't explicitly told that if he remained silent that silence would not be used against him, was he?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,246.189,246.808,No.
1992.91-7358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.924,249.124,There was no explicit statement in this case.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,253.311,257.446,"--Yes, and as this Court has interpreted in Doyle and subsequent cases."
1992.91-7358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,277.176,284.996,"Well, it's true, isn't it, every court that's dealt with this so far has found a Doyle violation, so that's the... the premise for your argument is clear, isn't it?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,284.996,289.067,"Every court except the first court, the trial court... the most important one."
1992.91-7358,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.356,304.26,"That's right, it was found to be error and harmless error in the State appellate court."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,304.26,315.033,"The appellate court... the State appellate court found it was not harmless error, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found it was harmless error, and that's the only court that has found it to have been harmless error."
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.033,317.884,"Well, that was the standard they applied... harmless error."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,317.884,318.669,That's correct.
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.669,320.486,The Chapman standard.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,320.486,323.138,"That's what they purported to apply, yes."
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.138,328.525,So we are the sixth court to have considered the question in this case.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,328.525,332.661,"Yes, Your Honor, you're the sixth."
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.693,358.228,So what happened in the district court on Federal habeas?
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,358.228,379.225,"The district court... the district court properly applied the Chapman standard and found that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, that the State had failed to meet its burden, and found specifically that the use of the silence, the impermissible use of the silence, may have been critical to the actual--"
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.225,381.427,So it disagreed with the State supreme court.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,381.427,382.26,"--Yes, it did."
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,382.26,388.414,And the court of appeals reversed the district court--
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,388.414,389.1,The court of--
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,389.1,390.616,--And applied a lower standard.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,390.616,395.336,"--The court of appeals applied a different standard, reversing the district court, yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-7358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.336,408.077,Do you think that a Federal court on habeas owes some deference to State court findings as in this case that the error was harmless?
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,408.077,411.279,Not to the findings that the error was harmless.
1992.91-7358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.706,432.443,"Yes, the State court is presumably in a better position to make that determination than the Federal court."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,436.93,446.019,"--The deference that is due, is what this Court said in Brown v. Allen, is what those findings are entitled to, but no more than that."
1992.91-7358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.718,488.279,Why do you suppose we don't apply a rule that in determining whether there is a due process violation in the first instance you have to examine whether there's been any harm done?
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,498.737,506.908,"This Court can certainly establish due process rules in that manner, and I think in some cases it may have."
1992.91-7358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.908,507.593,"I mean, that would be typical."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,511.129,515.931,But in the Doyle case line this Court has not started off that way.
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,639.059,651.116,"What was your explanation for the phenomenon that the rule on 2255 in Federal habeas, the standard of review, seems to differ from that of Chapman--"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,651.116,653.135,It does--
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.135,657.456,"--And why should this be, if there is this difference?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,657.456,682.338,"--Well, the cases that I've seen... I'm assuming I'm thinking about the same sort of case line... would suggest that in Federal... Federal habeas corpus in 2255 relief, it's quite analogous to, or the Court treats it as analogous to, in some instances such as out of the District of Columbia convictions, that are effectively the same as in State court."
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,708.739,712.424,What about the standard for determining whether or not there's reversible error?
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,723.546,732.302,"I think different considerations may sometimes apply, particularly when you're coming from Federal jurisdictions and Federal convictions."
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,732.302,732.919,Why?
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,732.919,737.139,This Court's supervisory power may also be implicated.
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.139,738.305,"Well, that would indicate--"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,738.305,738.705,Part of the--
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,738.705,743.376,--That would indicate that we would have a broader standard of review over a Federal conviction.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,743.376,747.995,"--I don't think it speaks to the standard of review, or the appropriateness of the standard of review."
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.162,790.607,"Well, I'm asking what those different considerations are, because it seems to me that at root is the proposition or the premise that State courts are not as adept or as capable as enforcing Federal rights of determining them as the Federal courts are."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,790.607,792.79,--I don't think that's part of the proposition.
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.597,812.119,So you're willing to submit the argument on the theory that State courts are as adept and as capable and as willing to enforce Federal rights as Federal courts are.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,812.119,813.619,I don't think that's at issue.
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.088,819.457,"Well, if it's not at issue, are you willing to put the argument on that basis?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,823.075,854.046,"--No, I'm not willing to accept that, and I think this Court has several times suggested that that argument is inappropriate, that there is an obligation that Federal courts have to ensure that State courts tow the constitutional line, or tow the constitutional mark when reviewing the Federal constitutional questions which they sometimes must review, and that in the ideal world there would be no lesser standard and no lesser guarantee of Federal constitutional rights in State courts."
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.046,869.055,"But in applying those rights to determine whether or not a conviction should be reversed under a Chapman standard or some other standard, aren't the State courts in an equal or better position than the Federal courts to make that determination?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,869.055,877.828,"No, they're not, and they're not because they have so many other considerations to worry about in cases that come up on direct appeal in the State courts."
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,908.949,911.984,So is the difference one of competence between the two types of tribunals?
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,911.984,912.334,No.
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.488,1060.598,"Has this Court ever decided, Mr. Shoenberger, whether harmless error is a question of law or fact, or a mixed question of law and fact, such that whether or not deference might be due to a State for determination?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1060.598,1064.05,I'm not aware of this Court ever deciding that particular proposition.
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.05,1095.838,"Well, the district court specifically accepted the facts, the historical facts of the State court, but then said that whether a constitutional error is harmless is a question of Federal law, it is not subject to the presumption of correctness given to the State court's findings of fact, and it cited... it cited a court of appeals case in the 7th Circuit which in turn cited Harrington v. California."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1097.271,1098.806,That's... Harrington is direct appeal.
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.806,1099.306,Yes.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1099.306,1101.575,And we'd certainly--
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.575,1105.377,"Well, yes, but it's a question of whether it's a question of law or fact."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1105.377,1108.062,--We believe it's a question of law--
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.062,1108.529,Yes.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1108.529,1117.017,"--As a practical matter, and we would suggest that what's at issue here is certainly an issue for de novo review by the Federal courts."
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.659,1143.169,"Well, there is another... at least an unresolved matter of fact, and that's whether or not he received Miranda warnings before the Wisconsin Supreme Court mentioned when he was at the first... apparently after he had been arrested."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1143.169,1147.973,"That certainly... if there's a question of fact about that, that fact question's not been--"
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.973,1150.739,So at his initial appearance is the only thing in the record about getting Miranda warnings.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1150.739,1151.008,--That's correct.
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.408,1159.828,"And isn't there some uncertainty... incidentally, in your brief you quote the erroneous statements by the prosecutor."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1167.018,1167.818,No.
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.908,1196.687,"You see, because it seemed to me that one could read at least several of those as not necessarily referring to the time after his initial appearance, because they're talking about contacts with the police, and I take it those contacts might have been before his initial appearance and therefore before, as far as the record shows, he got Miranda warnings."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1198.203,1207.393,"There's ambiguity about at least one of those particular references, but the fact that it's ambiguous is something that goes directly to the jury's fact-finding power."
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.481,1214.548,"Well, but they didn't have a--"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1214.548,1214.948,--There is dispute--
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.948,1219.385,"--The jury didn't have a question put to it that raised the Doyle issue, did it?"
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1219.385,1220.102,--That's right.
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.102,1226.289,"They weren't asked when were Miranda warnings given, or was he silent before or after he got Miranda warnings."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1227.572,1228.158,That's correct.
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.443,1240.466,"And see, some of these statements about the... he didn't say anything until he bumped into the... at the time he talked to the police."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1247.536,1252.706,The question is not the statements.
1992.91-7358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.258,1256.691,Right.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1256.691,1257.441,--The Miranda warnings.
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.843,1260.629,That's exactly what I mean.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1260.629,1263.129,--And sometimes it's a little bit unclear.
1992.91-7358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.216,1274.27,"But, see, to the extent that it's unclear, it's not quite as clear as we assumed at the outset that any promise was broken."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1281.876,1314.514,"--Out of what I count up as five particular statements that the courts that have reviewed below have found to have breached the Doyle rule, only one, I believe, legitimately fits into a dispute category in terms of its referent, and that, the ambiguity in terms of that referent under Doyle and under Chapman ought to count in favor of Mr. Brecht in terms of trying to figure out whether there was a possible impact under Chapman to the conviction."
1992.91-7358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.514,1327.488,"Well, the district court in granting habeas certainly identified the post-Miranda statements that he relied on as saying that it might have made a difference."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1327.488,1328.505,That's right.
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1458.206,1468.68,Unless we were to say that that is the sort of determination by the State court that is entitled to some deference in Federal habeas proceedings.
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1468.68,1492.296,"But unless this Court said that complete deference of the type that Stone v. Powell is involved, would be appropriate, the Federal courts would still have to decide something, and in fact we suggest in our brief that the standard on Kotteakos developed for direct appeal requiring review of the entire record means that it's at least as burdensome, if not more burdensome."
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.296,1496.415,"Well, but I'm not talking about introducing the Kotteakos standard."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1522.815,1540.626,"Well, we believe there already is a deference inherent in the Brown v. Allen decision, but the deference is not a deference to say that we'll back off and a reasonable application of Federal law by State courts is what the defendant in this particular case was entitled to."
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.422,1564.059,"Well, you say take it for what it's worth, which of course is a somewhat ambiguous phrase."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1583.222,1603.969,"That would radically change the law of Federal habeas corpus from the way it has been for the last, I would suggest, 200 years, that once you reach the merits... once a Federal district court or a Federal court is supposed to reach the merits on Federal habeas corpus, that it's supposed to apply the same rules that it would apply on direct appeal."
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.969,1612.307,"Well, that's concededly true on questions of law, but I don't think it's necessarily true on other questions."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1612.307,1638.707,"Well, in one sense there are very few questions of law, for example, now, that are cognizable in habeas corpus at least in terms of new cases since the Teague rule establishes that we have to simply take the case of law, applying existing legal rules, so in effect you'd be closing the doors to virtually all Federal habeas corpus over State courts, were you to adopt a rule that does what you're suggesting."
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.707,1645.463,"Oh, I don't see that... I don't see that at all, because all we're talking about is a harmless error determination."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1645.463,1667.643,"But harmless error is... the harmless error determination speaks to virtually all constitutional violations except for those few categories where it's an automatic reversal rule, so it doesn't just speak to Doyle violations, it speaks to Miranda violations, to Sixth Amendment... other kinds of Sixth Amendment or Seventh Amendment violations."
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.63,1674.397,"Oh, I agree with you on that."
1992.91-7358,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1674.397,1675.065,Okay.
1992.91-7358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.882,1678.684,"Very well, Mr. Shoenberger."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1681.153,1686.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.88,1758.153,"May I ask, was the questioning by Officer Papke before or after the initial appearance?"
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1758.153,1759.186,Before.
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.186,1763.79,"Well, the district court thought that questioning was post-Miranda warnings."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1765.49,1768.759,"Yes, we think she is wrong on that one."
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.759,1769.611,--I see.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1769.611,1779.483,"The others, the only violation, however... and I would like to make this clear... is the prosecutor at no time singled out the post-Miranda silence."
1992.91-7358,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1966.121,1968.073,You find no exception to that.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1968.073,1969.59,"--That's right, no exception."
1992.91-7358,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1969.59,1970.925,Anywhere.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1970.925,1972.794,Not that I am aware of.
1992.91-7358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2047.608,2057.797,"You give no effect, then, to 28 U.S.C. 2111 with reference to direct review in the Federal courts."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2057.797,2060.083,"No, we do not."
1992.91-7358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.284,2076.426,"So the Chapman decision is correct, in your view, and the Federal statute under... that I've cited is irrelevant to that determination and to that rule."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2076.426,2079.895,I have not thought about that as a separate matter.
1992.91-7358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2094.054,2108.247,"I'm not sure that I understand your argument that there isn't much of an implication for the deterrent function of habeas or for the need for such a high standard, given the deterrent function of habeas."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2132.845,2140.701,Because this Court has mandated through Chapman that the State courts themselves shall apply the harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt standard.
1992.91-7358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2140.701,2152.259,"Well, and the Constitution of the United States mandates that the State court shall apply the Constitution of the United States, but we don't therefore necessarily adopt a lesser standard on collateral review in determining what's a constitutional violation."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2152.259,2191.734,"I think that you look at the costs and balances between whether that additional benefit of applying the highest... or nearly the highest standard of review, gives any added benefit on collateral review as opposed to, of course, the obvious significant... more costs on collateral review, and what we're saying is we don't think it's realistic to think that State prosecutors or judges or police are going to be willing to take a risk that might overturn a conviction when Chapman is applied in their State courts just because they know that on Federal habeas a lesser standard will be... a less stringent standard will be applied."
1992.91-7358,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2211.297,2223.105,"And the fact that our direct review is necessarily as limited as it is really, in your judgment, is nonetheless a sufficient interrorum deterrence mechanism."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2223.105,2230.009,"I think so, in combination with the other factors, which of course is primarily that Chapman is applied on direct review."
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.009,2233.628,"Well, I suppose... we denied cert in this case, did we?"
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2233.628,2235.461,He did not seek cert in this case.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.461,2236.044,I see.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2236.044,2267.865,"We believe that habeas should be limited to those situations in which it can be said that the petitioner has been deprived of fundamental fairness, that somehow the error is not just error that we cannot prove harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, but that it is error that so infected the entire trial that the conviction itself is a denial of due process."
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.421,2337.276,"There are going to be very, very few convictions, State convictions that would be upset on Federal habeas under the Jackson standard."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2337.276,2337.811,That's true.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.311,2340.513,We know that from experience.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2340.513,2342.046,--That is the least protective.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.85,2415.894,"So what... on direct review, suppose we reverse a case and find, contrary to the State court, that this was not harmless error, and so there's going to be a new trial."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2423.484,2427.102,--And that the State has not been able to prove that error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.102,2431.571,"Well, I know, but that's a... it's a constitutional rule, then."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2431.571,2444.064,"Well, it's a constitutional rule in the sense that... I don't think that in Chapman this Court would have had to adopt that test as the test for harmless error."
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.661,2472.231,May I just ask you to comment on this thought--
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2472.231,2472.748,Sure.
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.748,2478.285,--The question of the difference between the harmless... the Chapman standard and the Kotteakos standard.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2496.782,2505.721,"Well, I think it does, because I think you have to remember that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals also found all the pre-Miranda references to be error."
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.721,2508.59,"That's right, but they did not apply the Chapman standard."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2513.375,2519.046,"But I believe in doing that they meant to include the... I mean, they thought they were applying the Chapman standard."
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.046,2520.731,"Well, I don't know how you can tell that from the opinion."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2529.67,2531.237,"That's right, the 7th Circuit used Kotteakos."
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.237,2531.87,"Did it apply it, then?"
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2531.87,2532.956,"Yes, it did."
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.956,2534.889,"Well, it made a difference to them."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2534.889,2535.99,"Yes, it--"
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.99,2543.744,"Well, that's what Judge Easterbrook said, but then he also said he didn't want to trudge through the record, so I'm not sure he thought he should trudge through the record under either standard."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2544.846,2545.163,--Right.
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.663,2548.898,But he seems to think under one you trudge through the record and under the other you don't.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2548.898,2549.798,--Well--
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.798,2550.25,Do you think that's right?
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2550.25,2551.117,"--No, I don't think that's right."
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.4,2553.369,Do you think... they did have the duty to look at the entire record.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2553.369,2554.669,"--Yes, and I think he did so."
1992.91-7358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.669,2555.821,Even under Kotteakos.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2555.821,2556.671,"Yes, definitely."
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.671,2563.808,"And at least... and when it got to the district court, the district court had to act contrary to what it did originally."
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2568.229,2571.081,"I'm sorry, I--"
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.081,2574.033,"I mean, consistent with the court of appeals ruling--"
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2574.033,2574.499,--Oh.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.499,2578.967,--It dismissed the petition for... denied Federal habeas.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2578.967,2579.686,Right.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.803,2718.258,Do you think that silence after Miranda rulings has the same significance as before the warnings?
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2722.229,2724.495,I think the probativeness is the same.
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.72,2737.322,So it is less probative.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2737.322,2739.639,"No, I think two inferences can be drawn."
1992.91-7358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.639,2741.291,It only might... it only might be less probative.
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2741.291,2752.331,"It might be, just like any other evidence that is ambiguous, or from which two inferences might be seen as less probative, but that isn't the reason that we don't let it in, I don't think."
1992.91-7358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.12,2776.714,"I guess if we told him you have a right to make a confession, and then his making of a confession, if we used the confession against him, that would be unfair too, right?"
1992.91-7358,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2776.714,2777.447,I think so.
1992.91-7358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.335,2888.62,"Thank you, Ms. Wellman."
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,2891.155,2895.624,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3028.192,3035.281,"General Barr, would you go so far as to say that's true in those cases that have been automatic reversals such as total denial of counsel, or something like that?"
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3035.281,3036.731,"--No, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-7358,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3094.236,3096.688,"How, as a matter of fact, do we know that?"
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3099.307,3109.596,"--That... the... if it doesn't perform a deterrent function on direct review, then what's the purpose--"
1992.91-7358,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3109.596,3145.936,"Well, I'm sure it performs some, but again, given the fact that to the extent that a Federal... that the guarantee of the Federal system is an element at some point in enforcing the Chapman standard, and given the fact that direct review by a Federal court is extraordinarily limited, how do we know, as matter of fact, that a substantial deterrent function is being performed by direct review alone, and it will not be sacrificed if we adopt a lesser standard on collateral?"
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3145.936,3170.403,--That question boils down to this: will a prosecutor facing Chapman on direct review through the State system and potentially on cert in the Federal system really play fast and loose with the Constitution because he may be facing down the road on collateral review Kotteakos rather than Chapman?
1992.91-7358,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3170.403,3182.544,"Well, the... you can focus it on the prosecutor only if you, I suppose, limit your argument in this case to the application of the Kotteakos standard in a Doyle case and not to habeas generally."
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3221.102,3255.407,"Well, the Kotteakos standard has worked for nonconstitutional errors, which can be just as prejudicial as a constitutional error, and it's also essentially the standard that we use... the Kotteakos standard, whether there's a substantial probability of prejudice... is the standard we use on Donnelly v. DeChristoforo potential due process violations in the State system, it's the standard we use for ineffective assistance of counsel in the Strickland case, although the burden is shifted by Strickland and DeChristoforo."
1992.91-7358,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.09,3390.779,"Well, the next question, I suppose, is that there are historical facts to be considered and then there's a question of law to be drawn from those facts--"
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3390.779,3391.881,"Correct, Justice White."
1992.91-7358,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.881,3393.731,--And the district court purported to do just that.
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3399.552,3400.285,That's correct.
1992.91-7358,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.285,3406.39,--And then said that the ultimate judgment of harmlessness is a question of law.
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3407.607,3408.807,No.
1992.91-7358,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.925,3413.727,Well... mixed question.
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3420.465,3424.185,It's a determination--
1992.91-7358,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.185,3429.321,"The judgment of harmlessness, isn't it a question of law?"
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3453.788,3462.644,"--Well, here, Justice White, the record is before the Court, and the Court has to make a judgment--"
1992.91-7358,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.644,3462.96,Right.
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3462.96,3475.368,"--as to whether or not that jury was influenced by the error in the case and whether it had some kind of determining influence on the verdict, and it seems to me that that's a mixed question."
1992.91-7358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.368,3487.509,"May I ask, General Barr, in your... in the notion of deference, do you think it is part of the duty of the Federal court to read the entire record under either standard, Kotteakos or Chapman?"
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3487.509,3488.775,"Yes, I do, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-7358,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3518.981,3521.114,May I ask you just one final question?
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3528.602,3541.66,"There is an argument for, obviously, limiting it to the Doyle case or just deciding the Doyle case here, based on what the purpose of the Doyle rule is."
1992.91-7358,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3558.706,3563.026,"But there's nothing essential in your argument that confines it to Doyle, really."
1992.91-7358,2,44087,william_p_barr,,3563.026,3563.326,No.
1992.91-7358,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.173,3586.875,"Thank you, General Barr."
1992.91-7358,3,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,3591.927,3594.379,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1992.91-7358,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3717.36,3737.923,"Do you think it would be error if the district judge on Federal habeas said well, this is an awfully close case, I probably would have come out differently in deciding harmlessness than the State Supreme Court did, but it's a close case and I'll just go along with the State Supreme Court?"
1992.91-7358,3,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,3737.923,3738.839,I think that's error.
1992.91-7358,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.725,3756.985,"Even though the State courts may know an awful lot more about what might affect the jury in their State than some Federal panel, or some district judge?"
1992.91-7358,3,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,3756.985,3760.872,"--They may know more, or they may know less in a particular case."
1992.91-7358,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3762.755,3763.907,You can finish answering.
1992.91-7358,3,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,3763.907,3770.144,"The particular application is something that we can't tell about, and that's the essence of it."
1992.91-7358,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3779.583,3780.8,"Thank you, Mr. Shoenberger."
