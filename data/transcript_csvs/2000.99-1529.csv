2000.99-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.429,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1529, Donna Rae Egelhoff v. Samantha Egelhoff."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,53.12,60.467,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,187.584,207.247,"Of course, what you say applies exactly similarly, I take it, to a State statute that would say, if A murders B, A shall be treated as having predeceased B for purposes of inheriting from B, or in a word, A can't inherit from B. All that you've said would apply to that similarly, so what's the difference?"
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,207.247,211.115,"If that were a State law, then it would be preempted."
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,211.115,223.055,"In other words, you're saying that basically this ERISA preempts all of what you call the slayer statutes, I guess, that traditionally have said you can't inherit from a person you murder."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,223.055,225.695,It preempts the slayer statutes.
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.026,247.257,All right.
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,257.289,262.983,"It may encompass simultaneous death, a simultaneous death rule."
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,262.983,268.716,"All right, so if it... now we have it interpreting a considerable area of State probate law."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,286.415,288.95,"I can imagine where you're headed, Justice Breyer."
2000.99-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,321.962,328.134,I'm not sure about you... how you distinguish the slayer statute.
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,335.908,357.909,"Well, the difference, Justice Kennedy, is that the slayer... the slayer rule was part of the common law, was part of the common law of trust at the time that ERISA was enacted, and it may be presumed that the Congress, seeing that as a backdrop, incorporated, impliedly incorporated the slayer rule into ERISA."
2000.99-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.909,361.422,"But not simultaneous death statutes, because they vary from State to State, or--"
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,361.422,364.429,"Well, I'm not sure about simultaneous death statutes, quite frankly."
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.927,388.601,"--May I just... is your point that it was the law before ERISA was passed, or that it's part of the common law."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,388.601,389.194,--That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.194,391.037,"I mean, which is true?"
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,395.875,397.045,"No, not the statute."
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,408.692,409.87,So your point is that--
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,409.87,410.555,--on similar Federal statutes--
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.555,413.201,"--Your point is, the other was a common law rule, not the timing."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,413.972,414.441,--That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.026,426.638,"--Yes, but you've said that if there had been a statute which is in effect that wouldn't have done the trick."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,426.638,427.25,That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.25,432.898,"Well, when you say a common law rule, we're dealing with a country with 50 different States."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,436.629,460.455,"Not with regard to the slayer rule, in fact, and indeed what is important here is that the slayer rule had been applied in Federal cases as a gloss to death benefit statutes, and so one can assume that the Congress, or one can rule that the Congress had impliedly incorporated that common law rule into ERISA."
2000.99-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.455,467.164,Even in the face of a provision in ERISA that says benefits have to be paid to the named beneficiary?
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,467.164,473.417,"With regard to the slayer rule, if it had been incorporated into ERISA, then it would be incorporated as an implied exception."
2000.99-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.417,477.995,What is the mechanics of the working of a plan?
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,501.761,504.495,"Yes, they would be responsible under those circumstances."
2000.99-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.477,525.852,"Well, does he have to look into a whole bunch of factual matters like, you know, whether this beneficiary might be disqualified by some State, State statute like the slayer's--"
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,525.852,526.401,No.
2000.99-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.931,562.231,"--It seems to me that would be a much narrower ground for ruling in your favor here, rather than these general assertions about the incorporation in the common law, that perhaps if a State statute actually directly affects the designation of a beneficiary, the way the Washington statute does, it may be different than the slayer statute."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,562.231,578.892,"--But we believe that State law, Mr. Chief Justice, that a State law like this, which is essentially a rule of decision for employee benefit plan, is preempted both as a matter of express preemption and as a matter of conflict preemption under ERISA."
2000.99-1529,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.892,588.351,"But you agree that your argument is stronger... let's assume that the statute does not incorporate slayer statutes, or simultaneous death statutes--"
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,588.351,588.684,Yes.
2000.99-1529,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.684,589.337,--or simultaneous death rules.
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,598.692,600.405,I believe it's equally strong.
2000.99-1529,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,600.405,613.216,"Well, if it's a flat conflict preemption, it seems to me relatively easy for us to say, look, the statute says, beneficiaries or plans designate the--"
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,613.216,614.068,Participants.
2000.99-1529,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,614.068,616.603,--participants or plans designate beneficiaries.
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,640.043,655.908,"Well, obviously, we believe that there is both conflict preemption and express preemption here, and the Court can certainly, as it did in Boggs, not reach the question of express preemption and go off on conflict preemption, but--"
2000.99-1529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.908,681.33,"Well, except your... I think the point being made is that your preemption is stronger if you're willing to swallow the bitter pill of not including the slayer statutes, but once you say the slayer statutes don't pose any conflict, it's hard to see why they pose any more of a conflict than... or, excuse me, any less of a conflict than the statute here."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,681.33,698.352,"--In Ridgeway v. Ridgeway, which was a decision of this Court involving the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act, the Court noted the slayer rule and determined that it did not have to deal with it in the context of that case and that it was an extreme example."
2000.99-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.359,706.972,Mr. Kilberg--
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.972,736.009,"--But is... is the answer that you gave in talking about the administrative burden... my understanding, and correct me if I'm not right, that this statute says that if a trustee of a plan doesn't know about this problem, he doesn't have to pay, and if he does know about the problem, he doesn't have to pay until the State courts resolve it, and if that isn't good enough, he can opt out of the whole thing just by putting a sentence in the plan that says, I opt out, in effect."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,749.065,760.24,"Oh, indeed, as we point out in our brief, I believe it's at footnote 8 on page 20 of petitioner's brief."
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.24,760.366,Yes.
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,760.366,766.979,It's also described in amicus briefs for the National Coordinating Committee and in the Western Conference of Teamsters.
2000.99-1529,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.414,806.914,Which is?
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,806.914,814.08,"--Well, which is that you have to specifically opt out, and you have to opt out in the manner in which the State tells you you have to opt out."
2000.99-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.08,819.535,And you may not know which State is the State that will govern.
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,819.535,820.922,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.99-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.922,831.641,"But before we get into that, I'm still a little confused on the nature of the common law that we're talking about."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,839.082,840.045,That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,840.045,844.351,"You're talking... and you're not talking about the pre-Erie general common law, either."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,864.85,865.741,That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,865.741,869.911,"But it would be a Federal, a true Federal common law rule."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,869.911,870.875,That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.875,890.337,"And that with all Federal statutes, or most Federal statutes, there will be a penumbral area, and what would fill that in would not be the law of any particular... common law of any particular State, but Federal common law."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,890.337,891.3,That's correct.
2000.99-1529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.269,916.3,"I mean, if there is such a Federal common law I suppose we could invent a... you know, the same spousal substitution rule that the State has done by statute here."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,924.084,926.181,"--I'm afraid not, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-1529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.181,926.314,--No?
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,926.314,954.098,"I was moving on from Justice Ginsburg's question to distinguish between Federal common law which is incorporated into a statute, because it is the common law against which the Congress legislates, which is what I would be referring to with regard to the slayer rule, and that would be the common law in extant in 1974 that had been applied in other Federal cases to other Federal death benefit statutes."
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.957,980.577,"Well, of course, that's the question in the case, whether it does."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1005.413,1009.048,--It looked... it would be the plan administrator's choice.
2000.99-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.447,1020.325,He would confine his inquiry entirely to the terms of the plan itself?
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1020.325,1021.152,--He... no.
2000.99-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1027.589,1044.195,"Mr. Kilberg, the Washington supreme court seems to have analyzed the decedent's life insurance policy separately from the pension plan in doing the preemption analysis."
2000.99-1529,0,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1051.413,1056.405,I believe we can apply... the Court can apply the same analysis for both of them with one exception.
2000.99-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.563,1079.518,"Very well, Mr. Kilberg."
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1082.069,1089.734,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.131,1127.425,"Suppose, Ms. McDowell, you have a trustee under an ERISA plan who has a designated beneficiary and so forth and perhaps, you know, ambiguity as suggested by Justice... something else... and then you have simply a trust company that has exactly the same provisions but it's not an ERISA plan."
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1136.22,1145.671,"As a practical matter, they may do essentially the same thing interpreting the terms of the plan, or whatever instrument governs it."
2000.99-1529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.075,1173.018,"So... but would the Federal common law likely be different from the State of Washington's law, or is it just up for grabs, kind of?"
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1173.018,1187.256,"In many instances the appropriate rule would presumably be for the plan administrator of the ERISA plan to look to State law for guidance, for example, in determining who was a spouse, who was a child, et cetera."
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.751,1205.312,May I ask two questions?
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1208.892,1210.063,"--Yes, it is."
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.372,1224.817,"My second question is, in weighing the various interests at stake here, should we give any weight at all to the interests in carrying out the wishes of the former employee who... whose assets are being distributed?"
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1224.817,1228.592,"No, we shouldn't--"
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.592,1228.716,We shouldn't.
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1228.716,1230.733,"--In the first place, we don't know his wishes."
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.873,1245.417,"Well, we know he presumably was advised by a lawyer, who was a State lawyer who told him what the State rule of law was, and presumably he was told he could rely on the fact that he didn't have to change his designation for his sons to get the property."
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1250.353,1252.688,--This individual in fact was not represented.
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.358,1277.556,"Of course, unless as a matter of law, there is a rule of law that automatically changed the... such as the slayer rule."
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1288.412,1293.134,--I don't think there's any way to say what the plan participant intended at this point.
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.134,1296.099,Because normally in the divorce settlement... they did have a divorce settlement... don't they provide otherwise?
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1306.317,1311.485,"Well, certainly there is the possibility under ERISA to obtain a qualified domestic relations order."
2000.99-1529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.96,1323.926,Your basic... you think he really wanted the money to go to his divorced wife.
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1325.065,1327.647,"My point is, we don't know, and an ERISA plan--"
2000.99-1529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.647,1342.898,"What about ordinary common sense, that a person who just divorces his wife, gives her half the property, might prefer that the other half of the property go to his children, rather than this wife, who's now going to get more than her fair share, and whom he's just divorced?"
2000.99-1529,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1354.32,1358.419,"--Well, that's a sensible approach, and ERISA plans could adopt that approach--"
2000.99-1529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.419,1375.33,"And is there some reason... all right, is there any... so then is there any reason to think that Congress wouldn't have wanted State statutes that don't interfere that much with anything and in fact embody that common sense notion, like you wouldn't like your property to go to the guy who kills you."
2000.99-1529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.154,1383.726,"Ms. McDowell, that common sense approach is disagreed with by two-thirds of the States, as I understand it, right?"
2000.99-1529,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1705.241,1709.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.533,1787.646,Maybe she thought she got it.
2000.99-1529,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1787.646,1788.458,That is--
2000.99-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.458,1790.553,Maybe she had a good lawyer who read ERISA--
2000.99-1529,3,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3441.518,3443.903,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-1529,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3576.561,3578.729,"Thank you, Mr. Kilberg."
