1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,13.799,17.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,366.25,375.243,"In stating your question in the second alternative way, you meant -- you mean post conviction remedy other than direct appeal?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,375.243,375.717,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.046,382.91,And either stated appeals deal or an unsuccessful appeal.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,382.91,387.369,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,455.97,462.13,Does the Iowa Court has any discretion (Inaudible)
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,462.13,466.661,"As I understand it, Your Honor, the Iowa Court does not have any discretion."
1960.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,477.417,482.123,"What other post-conviction remedy does Iowa have, if any?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,482.123,485.47,"There is, I believe no other post-conviction remedy, Your Honor."
1960.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,485.47,487.52,There isn't.
1960.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.52,492.691,There is provision for in forma pauperis direct appeal without (Inaudible)
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,492.691,493.488,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,519.328,546.742,"Mr. Hill, may I ask you whether the farmers that come to the Court go into the -- whatever you call them, the registry, adversity, or clerk of the Court, the funds that come in as a result of the fee, is the -- is the avowed theory that they possibly go to sustaining the cost of the judicial system?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,546.742,547.49,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,547.49,551.501,They go to a separate court fund or do they go into the general service?
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,551.501,552.846,I'm not sure of the accounting.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,568.602,578.001,"You happen to know whether all the fees that go into carrying on litigation, does that sustain the cost of the administration."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,578.001,580.892,"I would imagine not Your Honor, I do not -- I don' know."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,585.173,588.304,But the -- the idea is that it should in part contribute --
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,588.304,588.633,It helps --
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,588.633,590.204,"-- to the cost to maintain the judicial administration of the Court, the legal system."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,590.204,596.262,"Yes Your Honor, it helps to maintain for the -- legal system of the state."
1960.174,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,832.983,835.849,Is that a deportation case?
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,835.849,842.512,"I believe that was a criminal case, Your Honor."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,843.462,862.274,"Why -- why did it become relevant to pass any -- express any view as to whether it was -- what the character of it, it was civil or quasi civil or criminal or quasi criminal?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,862.274,865.508,"Your Honor, I can't answer that right away."
1960.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.544,889.34,"Federal system it's -- it becomes quite important from at least one point of view, and that is the time for an appeal, the time in which an appeal made."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,896.279,900.888,Well there are a number of -- there are a number of various distinctions of course that would flow from the --
1960.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,900.888,909.308,"Number of others but that's technical way in which you be dispositive, through which the issue can become very important."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,909.308,934.235,"Now in one state at least, in Kansas, in Gleeson versus Commissioner which is cited on page 15 of the petitioner's brief, the Kansas court said that at least in cases like this, where criminal prisoners were involved who were seeking habeas corpus; habeas corpus was criminal or essentially criminal in nature."
1960.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1706.593,1707.581,Can I ask you a question?
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,1707.581,1708.709,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1708.709,1713.81,Is it true we're not that every prisoner up at Fort Madison has $4.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,1716.368,1719.899,"Your Honor, work is made available by the State."
1960.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.428,1836.591,(Inaudible)
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,1836.591,1858.635,"That seems to be the whole -- I say it seems to be because in that case they allude to the fact that the Supreme Court of Minnesota had special -- had jurisdiction to issue a writ under special circumstances and they specifically say at one point in the decision that the special circumstances have not been shown, but then they go ahead with this other language to the effect of the remedy."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2007.49,2030.865,"Mr. Hill, have you had opportunity to find out what the state of the law in the various states is regarding the duty believed to furnish, to bring the habeas corpus proceedings without a filing fee?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2030.865,2032.904,"Your Honor, I have not made an exhaustive survey."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2055.967,2059.824,Either explicitly or with reference to habeas corpus.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2059.824,2060.411,I -- I --
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2060.411,2066.664,"It would less likely, I think probably where it is, there probably is a generalized provision, would you think so?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2066.664,2067.462,I would think so.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2082.495,2086.891,"So, it's a certain, It must be a certain fiscal difficulties for courts to do it."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2091.824,2102.036,"But I would assume again that where there is already a criminal in forma pauperis method or procedure, these same funds could be made available."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2102.036,2105.021,It all depends on how legislation's view.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2115.614,2124.543,"I -- I do not know what the present situation Your Honor, I don't know, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2174.726,2178.012,Do you mean every -- every habeas corpus or for --
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2178.012,2181.477,Every habeas corpus where criminal prisoners are involved.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2181.477,2182.043,There criminal prisoners are involved.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2182.043,2183.017,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2189.746,2224.675,"But there are instances as Justice Stewart has indicated, there are procedural reasons for the distinction Tom Tong or such a case where the Court had to decide whether it was a final judgment, whether there was a final judgment or whether a certification was allowed by a divided court alone, if it was -- if the case couldn't come here on certification which said merely in criminal proceeding, that was there, the purposes of having direct review."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2232.716,2239.69,"And as I think Justice Stewart pointed out, there are other consequences that flow, the time governance and so forth."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2251.937,2255.285,"And as I you illustrate this, we just now have to make subdivisions for habeas corpus."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2255.285,2255.901,"Yes sir, which has been --"
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2255.901,2263.16,One would have to say habeas corpus in relation to or following upon a criminal proceeding.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2263.16,2263.866,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2292.064,2293.011,Let me stop you a minute.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2293.011,2294.486,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2294.486,2299.667,"As to the second, that might apply to an impecunious mother trying to get hold of her child, gained by the father."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2299.667,2305.233,"I think Your Honor again, you could say that it is the liberty of the individual to make the distinction."
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2305.233,2310.681,"If you are going to draw a line of importance, that's just as importance."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2310.681,2311.779,It is just as important.
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2318.188,2319.872,What we are talking about in this case is that we --
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2319.872,2320.311,But it isn't --
1960.174,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2320.311,2321.793,-- the category of -- of --
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2321.793,2325.807,It isn't -- we don't have a mother here seeking the child of course.
1960.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2374.116,2375.067,Mr. Hill --
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2375.067,2375.835,Yes sir.
1960.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2375.835,2392.12,"How soundly can one contend that states must provide a post-convictions remedy when, under the laws, as I understand it, they do not have to allow even a direct appeal."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2392.12,2418.511,"Well it seems to me Your Honor that -- I will admit that the wording in Young versus Reagan is not quite as clear as I'd like to have it be and yet that seems to be the necessary implication of that decision, namely, that there must be some post-conviction remedy and the Court said, “If the Illinois does not have such a remedy, we want to be informed.”"
1960.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2418.511,2424.634,"Truly, because the federal habeas corpus could issue the statement."
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2432.126,2434.913,That is -- that is I believe true.
1960.174,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2440.124,2441.223,Oh surely to all.
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2441.223,2450.175,But it just seems to follow from the Young case that there must be a post-conviction remedy.
1960.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2457.838,2473.847,"Even if the State Mr. Hill, even if the State was not required to have a post-conviction remedy, though it did supply one for the rich from a theory of Griffin, it would still has to supply one for the poor, wasn't it?"
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2473.847,2479.909,"This would be -- this would be following from the argument in Griffin versus Illinois once having supplied in one, it must be available to all."
1960.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2479.909,2488.235,Well that was not the (Inaudible)
1960.174,0,34585,luther_l_hill_jr,,2488.235,2496.079,"Well in that case, then you would have to, I think, again get at the essential nature of habeas corpus."
1960.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2526.182,2531.165,Mr. Hultman.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,2531.165,2535.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court."
1960.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2977.679,2979.671,Is that a state of habeas corpus.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,2979.671,2991.828,"This was a state writ Your Honor, yes, brought by him to enforce a civil right which he claims against those are holding him in custody under criminal process."
1960.174,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3007.995,3017.277,I suppose there's nothing in the Constitution or anywhere else that would prevent a State if it wanted to from denominating a habeas corpus writ as a criminal proceeding.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3017.277,3017.557,No.
1960.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3040.522,3045.273,"Suppose -- suppose Iowa did denominate a criminal statute, what would be your proceeding?"
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3047.063,3060.814,"If -- Your Honor, if it were a criminal proceeding and a criminal statute defined by the Code of Iowa, then most certainly, I would agree with the decision of the Court which I do agree with wholeheartedly."
1960.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3073.675,3082.187,"Can it be -- can it be made in a more criminal matter than it is, exempted by the State labeling it as a criminal proceeding."
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3082.187,3108.309,"I think this would have an effect, Your Honor, but I think it should have greater delineation than just that, because the writ applies to many, many, many instances other than criminal proceedings as the Court has mentioned earlier, for example of other, with this small child who is being detained under circumstances maybe under Court order for example, and the writ is being sought to obtain the freedom."
1960.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3121.906,3136.204,"My clarity was more limited to that where simply, I understood you to say that the State should simply as the statute is saying that hereafter a habeas corpus proceeding designated as criminal proceeding."
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3137.58,3139.16,"It most certainly would, sir."
1960.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3140.69,3148.767,"Mr. Attorney General, may I ask you to what issue is that language of the Tom Tong case directed?"
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3148.767,3154.042,"The opinion itself, Your Honor, but it's just about a paragraph in length."
1960.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3154.042,3163.949,But was it -- was it on the question of whether -- whether he was entitled to file his petition in forma pauperis or was it directed to some other instance?
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3163.949,3167.725,"No, it was not directed to a question of in forma pauperis."
1960.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3268.339,3282.118,"Mr. Hultman is that precisely the fact, doesn't it, the judge make his decision on whether -- on what is necessary to have the man respond to the criminal proceeding."
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3305.018,3305.787,This is true.
1960.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3328.677,3344.397,"Well, I know but it wouldn't -- suppose the judge -- suppose the judge said to him, because you are an indigent and because we feel you will respond, we'll release you on your own reconnaissance."
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3344.397,3345.014,Yes.
1960.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3345.014,3351.035,"But if you did have some -- if you did have some money, well we probably require you to use some bail."
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3357.001,3362.705,"I would agree Your Honor but again, this is a matter which is permissive, on which the Court would agree."
1960.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3362.705,3363.062,Yes.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3363.062,3386.857,"And where the Court not permissive in my particular instance and declares the fund to be $100, $500, $5,000 or $10,000, if we follow this reasoning, then this act of the Court by the demanding of bail most certainly is in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the same as the requiring of a $4 or a $3 fee."
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3491.108,3491.577,Mr. Hultman.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3491.577,3492.77,Yes.
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3492.77,3498.494,"The object of the suit is what, liberty, isn't it?"
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3498.494,3504.188,"The object of the suit, yes, the object of the suit is that a wrong has been done, if you please."
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3506.247,3507.77,Of his -- deprived of what?
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3507.77,3509.341,Of his personal liberty.
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3509.341,3509.901,Alright.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3523.025,3523.383,No.
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3523.708,3525.424,Is that what you call the proceeding?
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3525.424,3525.674,No.
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3526.151,3527.488,You didn't call it civil or criminal?
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3527.488,3528.735,No Your Honor.
1960.174,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3528.735,3529.954,What's the distinction?
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3530.714,3533.59,I can't -- this is the very point I'm trying to make Your Honor.
1960.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3564.947,3580.06,(Inaudible)
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3580.06,3586.499,"Well I didn't mean just in answer to the good justice question a while ago, just a matter of nomenclature as such."
1960.174,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3629.246,3638.831,What would you -- what would you think would you think would be the situation if the State pass a statute like the Federal 2255?
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3638.831,3640.983,"I'm not sure that I follow the question, sir."
1960.174,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3640.983,3641.978,Never mind.
1960.174,1,22490,evan_hultman,,3641.978,3646.734,I'm not sure if I follow.
