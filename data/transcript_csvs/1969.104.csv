1969.104,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.659,"I think we are on 104, United States against Donnelly."
1969.104,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,8.706,11.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1302.62,1302.673,Mr. Chief --
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1302.673,1303.59,Mr. Pevos?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1303.59,1307.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1345.045,1346.851,Would you mind talking the other.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1352.178,1357.739,"Mr. Justice Brennan, in 1923 --"
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1357.739,1363.066,"In fact, this was his contemplation that is I guess, it is just ordinarily."
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1375.084,1412.074,"Well, perhaps my learned colleague didn't quite make it clear is to what the Internal Revenue Code Section 3670 or as presently Section 6323 (A) provided that notice of the lien, in order to be effective against subsequent purchasers, mortgagees, etcetera would be filed would be filed with the local office if the local office had designated -- if the state had designated such a local office and then provided that in the event the state had not designated such a local office then the federal filing would be applicable."
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.31,1456.83,"We didn't have that, is it not?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1468.611,1468.758,"Well, --"
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1468.758,1472.054,I wonder that part merely did not obtain this --
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1472.054,1478.069,I don't believe that obtains in most states Mr. Justice because most states have adopted the --
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1478.069,1480.684,In New Jersey almost a year.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1480.684,1496.873,"This maybe so, but in those States that have a state law designating the place to file a federal tax lien notice, the notices are filed in that state office, and not with the clerk of the federal court which was the problem of Michigan -- yes sir."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.873,1499.363,"Excuse me, go ahead finish your answer."
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1499.363,1502.29,"Well, they are not filed with the federal court."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1502.29,1509.465,What's your hypothesis as to why the title attorney would put an exception indicating that he had not searched for the federal tax land?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1509.465,1516.533,"Well Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the fact was correctly stated by my learned colleague."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.684,1594.254,"What was the date of the opinion, the title opinion?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1594.254,1601.412,The title opinion in this case Mr. Chief Justice was in either July or August of 1960.
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.208,1619.561,"But something led the title examiner, the title searcher to draw attention to the federal tax lien problem, did it not?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1619.561,1621.05,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.619,1668.971,But why that would -- why then as Mr. Chief Justice asked would you put in this exception of the title here?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1668.971,1676.923,Because the title company would be justified in relying on the records of the registered deeds office Mr. Justice White.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.923,1678.557,What did the exception say?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1678.557,1690.689,"The exception said that this abstract of title does not -- excuse me, this abstract of title covers, matters on file in the office of the register of deeds for Livingston County, Michigan."
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.432,1704.549,Didn't mention taxes?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1704.549,1704.684,No.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.218,1719.584,Would it that something in this regard the judgments?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1719.584,1720.312,That is correct.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.732,1742.203,Or is the title opinion in the appendix somewhere or?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1742.203,1743.335,"Ah, the --"
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.335,1749.884,Where is this disclaimer or caveat appear in the record we have before us here?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1749.884,1757.634,"I believe, it is in the appendix, I believe Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1770.563,1770.926,I just want to --
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1770.926,1777.918,But I believe that it was read to the trial court during argument and it would appear in the appendix under the record of the decision --
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1777.918,1779.127,During the colloquy here somewhere.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1779.127,1779.827,Yes.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1779.827,1780.609,I just wondered how --
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1780.609,1781.615,I believe so.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.615,1783.779,How we know how my brothers know this --
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1783.779,1785.121,"Yes, that appears that way."
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.121,1788.578,"This one will appear in the opinion, in the title opinion."
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1790.611,1796.384,"Yes, in the colloquy between counsel and the Court, yes sir."
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.376,1898.417,When did you say that Government filed with the relation of decision in the Union Central?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1898.417,1902.276,The Union Central was in December of 1961.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.002,1925.291,That was for some other lien arising from some other --
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1925.291,1925.482,No.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1965.608,1968.541,"Your point, your point is it didn't help the Government?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,1968.541,1981.787,"Well, it didn't help the Government, but it showed that the Government was no -- had no greater idea of what the end result of this confusion of Michigan law, because of perhaps the Youngblood case, then the Carlsons had."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.013,2299.801,"What are the equities any different really for a man who got in this predicament after the holding in Union Central, if he did not exercise the cautious approach and check with the federal --"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2299.801,2318.066,"Well Mr. Chief Justice, I would not defend the same position of the man who after Union Central, it becomes a law of the land, would go ahead and buy piece of property without inquiring it to the question of whether the notice was property recorded."
1969.104,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2399.726,2403.148,Have you read the briefs in the Union Central case?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2403.148,2404.684,Not all of them Mr. Justice Black.
1969.104,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2404.684,2414.43,You know whether anyone suggests any possibility of prospective application or retrospective application as distinguished from one another?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2414.43,2416.593,I cannot answer that truthfully.
1969.104,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2431.953,2438.017,"I haven't read the briefs recently, but I do not recall any such question came up in any --"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2438.017,2438.206,I don't --
1969.104,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2438.206,2439.44,-- point in that case?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2439.44,2441.367,I don't believe that the issue was raised.
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2453.765,2454.664,Tell me Mr. Pevos?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2454.664,2455.78,"Yes, Mr. Justice?"
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2455.78,2463.272,"If Union Central is held to be retroactive, would the Carlson include?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2463.272,2468.341,"The Carlsons will be faced with a $36,000.00 foreclosure."
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2468.341,2470.501,To include?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2470.501,2472.096,That is right.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2472.416,2474.84,"Well, I thought that --"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2474.84,2475.135,Yes.
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2475.135,2494.506,"-- you have other claims before the District Court, but that Court did not reach because it decided the case on this issue, but even if the Union Central is retroactive, it would be, in my understanding that you had other claims, peculiar perhaps to your case?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2494.506,2496.531,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.104,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.531,2514.638,"And even if we should hold that Union Central decision is fully retroactive, then our actions should be in your submission, we should remand the case for the courts to turn their attention with the other -- to your other claims?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2514.638,2516.545,This would be correct Mr. Justice.
1969.104,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2531.559,2532.734,Is it a fact?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2532.734,2533.669,There are factual issues.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.308,2574.506,Wasn't it noted in the Union Central case here that the Court in Union Central was viewing a decision of the State Supreme Court of Michigan?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2574.506,2575.672,That is right Mr. Justice White.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.672,2583.223,And it was recited here that the Michigan decision was in conflict with the Court of Appeals' decision in the Eighth Circuit?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2583.223,2593.36,"That is correct, but the time sequence would indicate that the Michigan decision was after the Carlsons' purchase and it came to this Court after the Carlsons' purchase."
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.36,2599.638,But the -- I would take that the Union Central case had been in litigation for some time?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2599.638,2600.499,No.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.173,2651.969,Was there anyway for it to acquire Donnelly?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2651.969,2655.244,Only by word of mouth Mr. Justice.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.762,2676.188,But it was decided in 1960?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2676.188,2678.017,I believe it was decided in 1961 Mr. Justice.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.017,2680.572,But the Union Central by --
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2680.572,2684.141,"That was decided in December of 1961, and I believe that the Michigan --"
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.141,2685.772,"No, but in the Michigan Court?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2685.772,2689.774,"The Michigan Court if I recall, was in the early part of 1961."
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.526,2697.366,"Well, but the date on the opinion is September 16, 1960?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2697.366,2698.313,Right.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.301,2713.058,So it went to the lower courts of -- it had been decided in the circuit court obviously before the purchase?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2713.058,2713.813,This is true.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.424,2717.305,And then the District Court?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2717.305,2718.36,Not in -- no.
1969.104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.376,2721.329,There was after -- just two levels.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2721.329,2738.419,"At that time, there was the Circuit Court and an appeal directly to the State Supreme Court, and the decision of the circuit court was not generally made public, unless somebody happen to be familiar with it or come across it in the newspaper."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2969.104,2969.779,Mr. Pevos.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,2969.779,2970.038,Yes.
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.038,3000.397,"The record as I read it, indicates that the Court, I think it was the Court, United States District Judge made some inquiry about whether the purchasers had any right of action back against the abstract company, the title company that had prepared the abstract in either your response to that of someone else speaking for this litigating party as I think it was, your statement."
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3024.218,3026.797,Mr. Chief Justice as I said before.
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3033.545,3034.78,"No, they typed in for everybody."
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3034.78,3035.446,For everybody.
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.446,3036.67,For what reason?
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3036.67,3037.738,On hindsight.
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3037.738,3039.036,To protect themselves.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3039.036,3041.365,On hindsight Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.692,3045.969,I would regard that as foresight on the part of the abstract company.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3046.954,3047.406,Well --
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3047.406,3060.47,-- they protected themselves as you indicated to the trial judge by having that exception saying they were calling attention to possible liens that they had not searched for them.
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3060.47,3074.277,"Well Mr. Chief Justice and again, this is from my own knowledge and whether I can say this to be considered by this Court, I will say that as of 1970, the abstract companies in Michigan used that same exception."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3105.978,3116.927,"But absent that statement by the abstract company, they might well be liable to the purchaser, would they not?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3116.927,3124.284,"If they did not indicate that a separate request would have to be made for federal court lien, it very well could be, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3124.284,3157.128,"So that their foresight as distinguished from hindsight, their foresight as protected them and in the same manner, the purchaser could have protected himself by saying in effect if his lawyer was not experienced enough, what do you mean by this and how much does it cost and upon finding that it will cost $3.00 or $4.00 perhaps to make that search routinely or even less, depending on the number of entries, even he would have then been protected, wouldn't he?"
1969.104,1,21379,daniel_n_pevos,,3157.128,3173.721,"I would say that may have been, but at the time, they would have been a question whether or not the even the entry of a federal recording would have been anything except actual notice as opposed to constructive notice until the Union Central case was handed down."
1969.104,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.179,3198.127,Thank you Mr. Pevos.
1969.104,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3198.127,3200.725,"Mr. Zinn, may I ask at the outset?"
1969.104,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3200.725,3201.073,Yes sir.
1969.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3201.073,3203.06,The question I asked to Pevos.
1969.104,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3211.027,3215.664,Yes it does.
1969.104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.573,3217.025,Mr. Zinn.
1969.104,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3217.025,3221.23,"May it please the Court, just two or three brief points."
1969.104,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3291.185,3293.71,What two cases could not stand together?
1969.104,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3293.71,3302.931,"Youngblood, decided by the Sixth Circuit in 1944, and holding that a description -- no, and Glass City Bank."
1969.104,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3452.793,3454.317,"Thank you, Mr. Zinn."
