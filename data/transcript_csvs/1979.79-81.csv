1979.79-81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.317,We'll hear arguments next in Coffy against Republic Steel Corporation.
1979.79-81,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,70.969,74.098,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-81,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.738,799.333,All -- all employees laid off I take it will receive unemployment benefits from the State?
1979.79-81,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,799.333,800.018,That's correct.
1979.79-81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,915.663,921.849,"Well he -- but all that he would have accrued in 20 years is the same as he would have accrued in two years, doesn't it?"
1979.79-81,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,921.849,922.809,That's correct.
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1507.076,1510.756,Mr. Chief and may it pleases the Court.
1979.79-81,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1547.553,1549.533,(Inaudible) seniority plan?
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1549.533,1549.838,Pardon Your Honor.
1979.79-81,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1549.838,1552.034,Isn't that always true of a seniority plan?
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1552.034,1553.882,Yes.
1979.79-81,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1553.882,1556.114,But this one is so significant --
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1556.114,1558.391,That's always true of the seniority plan.
1979.79-81,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.214,1602.306,"But Mr. Nims, aren't there really three classes of -- of seniority that people who are senior enough not to be laid off, people who were in kind of a middle category who gets these benefits, and then the very, very junior people who don't even get this benefit and then the very, very junior people who don't even get these benefits."
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1602.306,1606.665,"That's true Your Honor, but that's true with almost any benefit."
1979.79-81,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.785,1649.232,"No, all I was suggesting was the fact that people who have even greater seniority gets some greater benefit doesn't necessarily take this benefit out of the category of benefits that are affected by the length of service."
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1649.232,1652.07,"No, I agree that it doesn't necessarily do that."
1979.79-81,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.892,1691.401,"Well, are you saying that every person who meets the 2 year requirement always gets 52 units?"
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1691.401,1691.766,No.
1979.79-81,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.344,1699.562,"Well then, even with among those who were eligible, seniority has an effect on the amount of the number of units and therefore the number of (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,1699.562,1722.22,"No, not seniority Your Honor, working day up to accumulating the maximum of 52 credit units if you haven't worked in 2 years and accumulated the 52 maximum credit units, yes the fact that you haven't done that work may result when you're having a lesser number of benefits."
1979.79-81,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2561.987,2563.5,That is theoretical --
1979.79-81,1,36422,michael_a_nims,,2563.5,2579.286,It's very theoretical particular in this -- particularly in this case in which there's been testimony as to these industry's that need under its own agreements to bring an individual in for 32 hours if it brings him in for one hour during the week.
1979.79-81,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.837,2584.469,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Horowitz?"
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2584.469,2588.39,I do have a couple points I would like to make Mr. Chief Justice.
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.137,2724.96,"But how long does it take to accumulate the 52, 2 years?"
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2724.96,2726.578,"It takes 2 years, yes."
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.578,2739.606,"So that once you've worked 2 years and accumulated your 52 credits from then on length of service doesn't count, or how much you worked doesn't count?"
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2739.606,2740.552,That's correct.
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.587,2741.666,Any (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2741.666,2742.441,Unless -- unless --
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.441,2749.088,"(Voice Overlap) anytime from 2 years on just no -- just no difference, but up to that time --"
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2749.088,2750.813,Up till that time there is a difference.
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.515,2755.046,And that's the – then that's the advantage that's being claimed here.
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2755.046,2755.566,That's right.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2766.552,2767.038,But no -- no --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2767.038,2767.225,That wouldn't have –-
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.225,2768.436,-- nobody can have more than 52?
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2768.436,2768.876,That's right.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2769.499,2771.015,So nobody can have 200 or 300?
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2771.015,2774.7,"No, but -- it wouldn't make any difference in this case if someone could have 200 or 300."
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.7,2776.63,But you can have less?
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2776.63,2778.602,"Yes, you can have less and petitioner had less."
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.602,2784.658,-- and then -- (Voice Overlap) says he was given less and he was entitle to the 52.
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2784.658,2785.547,That's correct.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2785.547,2790.932,An employee for the first 2 years is totally ineligible therefore he doesn't acquire any SUB's --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2790.932,2791.274,He -- he acquires credits.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.274,2792.777,-- but -- but then (Voice Overlap) –
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2792.777,2793.318,That they're not good for his --
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2793.318,2799.466,-- on the first day of the -- of his third year if he's worked at least 32 hours every week in the first 2 years?
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2799.466,2799.66,He would have --
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2799.66,2801.22,Does he immediately get 52?
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2801.22,2806.549,"Well, -- no, he gets -- he gets 1/2 per week so after a year he has 26."
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2806.549,2806.741,Yes.
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2806.741,2809.779,He has -- he has some writ and allege of 26 but they're not good for anything.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2812.237,2812.707,But my question was --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2812.707,2813.361,So --
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2813.361,2815.161,-- after on the first day of the third year --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2815.161,2815.684,Right.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.932,2817.673,-- if he's worked at least 32 hours --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2817.673,2817.922,That's correct.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.922,2824.166,"-- a week for each of two -- of the previous 2-year, does he immediately have 52 SUBs?"
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2824.166,2824.893,That's -- that's right.
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.694,2825.991,(Inaudible)
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2825.991,2826.681,"52 by that, yes."
1979.79-81,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.681,2828.348,"Yes, right."
1979.79-81,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.348,2841.791,"Mr. Horowitz, other than the interrupted service because of military duty, could a man get -- satisfy the 2-year requirement without also accumulating the 52 units?"
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2841.791,2846.051,"Yes, if he was on some leave of absence during the 2 years that --"
1979.79-81,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.051,2846.404,Any other leave of absence --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2846.404,2847.639,-- was not eligible --
1979.79-81,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.639,2850.377,-- he could still be accumulating his 2 years with earning any credits?
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2850.377,2856.636,That's correct and if he was on layoff status as well he would be accumulating his 2 years.
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.342,2900.454,This is a -- this is a factor to seniority and one just pointing the 2 year eligibility --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2900.454,2901.676,And for the number credits.
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.676,2905.521,And the -- and also the work credit.
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2905.521,2906.802,"The number of credits aren't, correct --"
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.802,2906.859,Well --
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2906.859,2907.472,-- whether by work or by some other --
1979.79-81,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.472,2916.266,"-- you say that he – if he hadn't been away, he had been working and would -- would -- would not only have been satisfying his 2 year eligibility requirement but also accumulating credit."
1979.79-81,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2916.266,2916.936,That's correct.
1979.79-81,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.156,2930.135,Thank you gentlemen the case is submitted.
