1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.577,We'll hear arguments this afternoon in Liparota against the United States.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,11.269,14.071,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.215,227.881,"In your view did that mean the jury need only find that the defendant knew that the food stamps were food stamps and not postcards, so to speak?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,227.881,229.621,"Yes, exactly."
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,275.562,280.946,Do you think Congress was concerned about acts or attitudes?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,280.946,299.299,"I think that Congress in drafting the statute used the word ""knowingly"" for some purpose, and I think that they... this is a statute where the element of it being in violation of the statute is written right into the words of the statute."
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,307.182,312.866,You don't think it means that Congress was concerned about whether he knew what he was doing?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,312.866,314.887,No.
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.801,324.593,And don't you think this instruction that was given submitted that issue to the jury fairly?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,324.593,329.356,"--It submitted the issue as far as ""knowingly"" goes."
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.63,498.767,"Of course, there's some bit of difference, it seems to me, because if you're talking about a prohibition against the sale of milk, milk is ordinarily an article of commerce, and you simply wouldn't expect its ordinary milk sale to be prohibited."
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,516.922,520.483,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor, and I certainly am not offering up milk."
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,541.966,544.618,Is there any way of purchasing food stamps?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,544.618,550.532,"--Is there any... no, there is no legal way of purchasing food stamps, that's correct."
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,550.532,554.826,So he starts off... he knew he was doing something wrong when he purchased.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,554.826,558.627,He told the jury that he didn't.
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,558.627,559.528,Hmm?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,559.528,561.271,But I admit he had a tough case.
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,587.107,592.791,"Like purchasing drugs, like purchasing opium, isn't it?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,592.791,597.734,"--Well, no, I don't think that it necessarily is the same as that."
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,598.324,599.904,You mean it isn't as clearly.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,599.904,616.976,"--I think that when you're trying to draw a line as to which limited... and in the U.S. Gypsum case the Court said there are very limited circumstances where in the absence of a term defining the mental state, you will imply that Congress meant strict liability as to that element, very limited circumstances."
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.45,654.61,"Under your analysis, the Government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the defendant knowingly acquired food stamps, but that he knew that his acquisition was not authorized by law, is that correct?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,654.61,655.452,That's correct.
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.452,657.933,How would the Government prove that second element?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,657.933,672.473,"Well, it was argued to the jury very effectively by the prosecutor in this case incidentally, enough the judge told her that she didn't have to, they said... she said these transactions took place in the back room."
1984.84-5108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.677,722.545,"Well, do you think it's a fair argument to say that in most of the cases, the vast majority of the cases like this, the defendant would know, he'd actually know that he was doing something wrong?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,722.545,723.396,--I think so.
1984.84-5108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.057,731.45,"And the Government says well, so why should we put the prosecutor up to have him prove it in every single case."
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,744.788,751.093,"--Oh, certainly in interpreting a federal criminal statute if the meaning is plain, that ends it."
1984.84-5108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.279,795.021,Do you think it's accurate to call this a strict liability case?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,795.021,796.273,"Well, strict--"
1984.84-5108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.273,800.487,"That the Government... if the Government wins, do you think it's a strict liability case?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,800.487,801.266,--No.
1984.84-5108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.451,807.351,"Yeah, I agree."
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,807.351,808.532,"--using words like ""strict liability""--"
1984.84-5108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.532,809.574,I agree with you.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,809.574,817.627,"--to talk about that we're recognizing that there are different elements in an offense, and we're talking about this particular element."
1984.84-5108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.675,913.018,Is it agreed that (c) does require proof of specific intent?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,913.018,917.592,--It requires the... yes.
1984.84-5108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,924.278,926.619,"Well, you read that as meaning specific intent."
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,926.619,930.082,"--As to that only... no, no, no, no."
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.63,967.985,"Well, is it entirely accurate to equate the term ""knowingly"" and speak of that as a specific intent?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,983.035,994.142,"Well, here again, I think that the Model Penal Code offers guidance, because the definition of ""knowingly"" there as to an act is different than ""knowingly"" as to a circumstance."
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1077.657,1083.301,"Assume the law was as you suggest, that the Government must establish that proof."
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1102.532,1120.555,"Well, I think that question is particularly raised in this case because of what I pointed out in my reply brief, that in fact, his knowledge was argued to the jury, even though the judge said that I couldn't argue it, the prosecutor argued it even though she didn't have to, and then I argued it responding to the prosecutor."
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1123.138,1123.486,Then the jury--
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1123.486,1131.591,"--on that point, it clearly presents this question: is it sufficient to say that the jury must have decided that in the absence of an instruction, and I say no."
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.824,1175.77,"--Well, if on the whole record it's perfectly clear that he did have the knowledge that you say should be shown, isn't that enough?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1175.77,1186.618,"No, because the jury when they got back to deliberate, they were looking at this instruction, they found that they did not have to find that he knew that it was in a manner in violation of the statute."
1984.84-5108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.278,1417.57,"Again, Mr. Huyck, do you... does one who presents coupons, a violation of (c), is he somebody who has acquired or possessed coupons in violation also of (b)?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1417.57,1420.331,"--It could be the same person, and it could be different persons."
1984.84-5108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1420.331,1429.655,"Well, and if (c) requires a specific intent and (b) does not, then why would the Government ever prosecute under (c)?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1432.847,1443.596,"Well, I think that that's true, that you could... if there were a grocer presenting coupons, he would be... he would by definition violate both sections certainly."
1984.84-5108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1444.896,1455.414,"Well, then the Government... if that's so, the Government could prosecute all these cases under (b) because it doesn't require proof of specific intent."
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1462.618,1466.32,I think that would be a possibility.
1984.84-5108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1468.051,1469.242,Only a possibility?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1469.242,1480.779,"--You might imagine some situations, but I certainly cannot offhand imagine a situation where a grocer presenting coupons under (c) who wouldn't be guilty of violating (b) because he acquired the coupons."
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.779,1489.725,Could your client have been prosecuted for... under the second provision?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1489.725,1491.398,The subsection (c)?
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.398,1492.277,Yes.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1492.277,1493.278,No.
1984.84-5108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.702,1500.534,There's no charge that he presented.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1501.634,1503.006,"Acquiring, that's it."
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1504.344,1509.988,Your complaint is lack of your instruction?
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1512.351,1525.47,"--Yes, although I would... if it was sent back for a new trial, I would certainly be content for an instruction specifically addressed to this element; that the jury be instructed that the defendant had to know that it was--"
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.47,1526.422,"You didn't ask for that, did you?"
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1526.422,1530.373,"--In other words, I don't think I would offer my specific intent instruction on a retrial."
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1536.857,1537.338,You'd want more.
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1537.338,1537.959,Yes.
1984.84-5108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1537.959,1539.178,I thought--
1984.84-5108,0,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,1539.178,1540.099,Thank you.
1984.84-5108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.099,1546.124,Mr. Rothfeld.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1546.124,1549.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.766,1628.317,"Mr. Rothfeld, in light of the comment you just made, under (b), someone who deals in food stamps knowing that they're food stamps, okay, can be convicted, can't he?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1630.428,1632.25,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.725,1642.246,"Now, you say he would have to be aware of the nature of his action."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1648.413,1649.582,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.582,1651.152,Any more awareness required?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1651.152,1658.898,"Simply that he was conscious of his activity with that, and so that any accidental conduct would not fall within the scope of the statute."
1984.84-5108,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.149,1673.097,"Well, if someone sent it to him in the mail and he opened the mail and found the food stamp, he probably wouldn't be guilty of anything, would he?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1673.097,1683.774,I think in the situation that you describe the language of the verbs in the statute impose some type of limitation as well.
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.689,1689.42,Why not?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1697.052,1699.974,"Well, it's conceivable that it would, Your Honor."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.974,1701.935,I mean you say that's not an acquisition?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1701.935,1706.138,"Well, there is little interpretation of the verbs in the statute."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.139,1723.53,"If he throws it away, he violates the regulation, doesn't he?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1723.53,1724.522,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.522,1728.473,"If he throws it away, doesn't that violate a regulation?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1728.473,1729.625,If he--
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.625,1730.916,Disposes of them in any way.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1734.757,1736.19,"--That would be true, Your Honor."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.19,1741.542,"If he got an envelope with stamps in them and tore them up and threw them in the wastebasket, under your view he'd commit the crime, I think."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1741.542,1742.601,"That's true, Your Honor."
1984.84-5108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.925,1752.719,"Yes, but he wouldn't commit a crime if he didn't... the envelope comes in the mail; he doesn't open the envelope."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1752.719,1753.941,--Then he would not have committed a crime.
1984.84-5108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.941,1755.23,He just tears it up.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1755.23,1756.122,That's right.
1984.84-5108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.122,1757.752,He says this is junk mail; I'll tear it up.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1759.605,1760.496,That's correct.
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.577,1768.28,"But if he opened the envelope and tore them up, then he would be doing it."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1768.28,1769.51,If he... if he--
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.51,1770.642,If he knew they were food stamps.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1770.642,1771.623,"--knew they were food stamps, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-5108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.865,1789.862,"Well, he could probably... and you might have a tough time proving that he intended or knowingly received food stamps, if all he did was get it in the mail and open the envelope."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1789.862,1791.935,"I think that's correct, Justice White."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1824.526,1829.479,"Well, in this case it'd be a line between somebody who doesn't know it's wrong to tear up the food stamps and somebody who does."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1838.936,1843.278,"Well, I'm not sure that situation arises with any frequency, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.278,1844.66,But that's the kind of thing you want to cover.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1848.533,1853.446,"We want to cover, I think, the situation--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.446,1855.737,Or people you can't prove that they knew it was unlawful.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1855.737,1856.778,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.362,1865.764,May I ask you to comment?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1883.395,1886.847,"Well, I think there are several responses to that, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1956.331,1971.382,"Well, you don't get into all of these isolated cases like the Sullivan law in New York, which is absolute liability for possessing a weapon, and they've lived with that for 30, 40, 50 years."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1971.382,1972.852,Absolutely.
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.852,1974.664,And nobody's had too much trouble with that.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1974.664,1978.087,I think the Court has repeatedly upheld the--
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.087,1984.431,"It's been upheld, and I'm talking appreciably in New York nobody raises any question about it."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1984.431,1985.67,--I think--
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1985.67,1987.363,And some people are completely innocent.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2001.833,2017.241,--I think that the Court's cases have consistently upheld the validity of statutes such as the one you've described in which knowledge... certainly knowledge of wrongdoing and in some cases knowledge really of any sort is not required.
1984.84-5108,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2017.241,2025.318,"Well, may I ask, if you prevailed today, I gather there'd be no reason for you to bring any more prosecutions under (c), will there?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2025.318,2026.697,"No, that's not correct, Justice Brennan."
1984.84-5108,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.7,2039.357,"I know what it's aimed at, but if one presents food stamps for redemption, hasn't one acquired or possessed them?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2039.357,2044.459,"--Certainly they have acquired or possessed them, but it would not necessarily be in a manner not authorized by law."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.725,2071.106,"Well, that would be... that would give him a defense under (c)."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2071.106,2072.178,"Under (c), that's correct."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.178,2075.5,"But it would not give him a defense under (b), under your view--"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2075.5,2076.369,"Well, he was not--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.369,2077.351,--would it?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2077.351,2087.489,"--I think it would, Your Honor, because he would not be the individual... we don't contend that subsection (b) implies respondeat superior liability on the proprietor of the food store who does not himself accept the stamp."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.993,2098.355,Let me back up.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2119.99,2122.692,"--I'm not... I don't think that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.692,2124.953,I have knowingly transferred the coupon.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2134.048,2139.872,"Well, the transaction between you, you as the owner of the food store, and your clerk is one that is authorized by law."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.246,2166.65,"Let me just ask you, supposing one of my clerks is in some kind of a counterfeit operation."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2182.528,2186.852,"Well, you certainly couldn't go ahead and sell them if you--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.852,2189.995,"Because the regulations prohibit me from selling them, isn't that right?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2192.196,2208.538,"--Well, I... the manner in which the grocer is redeeming them... he has accepted them in the normal course of business and is presenting them to an institution which is authorized to redeem them for him, and this is all in a manner that is authorized by law."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.538,2210.929,Then why can't he keep the money?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2210.929,2220.726,"Well, I'm not sure actually in that case, Justice Stevens, what the remedy would be, whether the remedy would recognize the grocer--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.726,2223.287,"The remedy would be, under your interpretation of the statute, he'd go to jail."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2227.127,2228.599,"--Well, no."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.708,2257.959,Let me change my question.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2290.691,2304.98,"Well, I'm not sure that he would be liable under... certainly in your first instance our position is that you would not be liable under (b), because the manner in which he had acquired them was an acceptable transaction."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.98,2311.145,"He got them from a subordinate who'd stolen them and brought them into the boss and said here are a bunch of food stamps, and he possesses them."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2316.319,2316.959,"Well, let--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.959,2322.434,"And if he's not, does he start to possess them illegally when somebody tells him they're all stolen, you know?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2322.434,2331.328,"--If the... well, I think to answer your second question first, yes, I think he would be at that point, because he would know that he was possessing them."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.328,2333.019,Illegally.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2337.471,2338.773,Well--
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.773,2343.147,It seems to me the critical difference in your view is his knowledge.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2343.147,2346.407,--No.
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.066,2360.128,Not just acquisition.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2362.679,2365.491,--I think that either of those--
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.491,2375.087,And I'm asking you: a) whether the possession is unlawful when there are a bunch of stolen food stamps in his desk that he doesn't know are stolen; and b) does it become unlawful when he's advised that they're stolen food stamps?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2377.338,2385.273,"--Well, I think in the instance in which he has no knowledge of any sort except that he has food stamps--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.273,2387.006,"He knows they're food stamps, and he knows he possesses them."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2387.006,2388.375,--And he knows that he possesses them.
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.614,2408.828,How would it help you if you used stolen money orders in place of the food stamps in Justice Stevens' question?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2408.828,2415.743,"--Well, I'm not sure there is a federal statute which would--"
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.743,2422.178,A federal statute of having stolen money orders?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2424.248,2425.46,"--Certainly, Justice."
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.46,2427.852,You'd better hurry up and pass one.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2427.852,2434.396,I think actually your hypothetical demonstrates our point.
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.573,2449.246,"Well, all they were were money orders."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2452.128,2454.959,If he had no--
1984.84-5108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.959,2456.529,Nobody told him they were stolen.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2456.529,2465.836,"--In that case, Your Honor, he would not be, so far as I know, guilty under any federal statute if he had possession of a property having no knowledge that it was stolen."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.107,2520.193,This brings us back to the colloquy earlier in the argument about the difference between drugs or guns or things.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2534.501,2541.284,"--Well, it's... where we differ with you, Justice Stevens, is the suggestion that they would not have any idea that they were doing some unlawful."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.284,2547.729,"Our hypothetical was the clerk in the grocery store was the crook, and he delivered the stuff to the boss."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2550.671,2554.955,But in that situation the boss--
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.955,2560.749,"Knows he possesses food stamps, but he doesn't know it's in violation of any regulation."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2564.552,2572.085,--I think the classic example of what we say the statute applies to is a situation such as the one here where someone... and I think--
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.085,2576.369,"Yes, if it modifies ""acquisition"", it also modifies ""possesses"" in the same way."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2576.99,2591.797,"--But I think the difference is a significant one, because your hypothetical is concentrated on a grocer who is a participant in the food stamp program who has authorized methods of acquiring food stamps and has acquired the stamps that you hypothesized have been stolen in the court--"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.797,2593.75,--That's exactly the person I'd be concerned with.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2604.417,2613.392,"--And that is why, Justice Stevens, we think that Congress made the distinction between 2024(b) and 2024(c)."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.401,2647.574,"Yes, but you keep avoiding the point, would you not agree that he would possess them in violation of a regulation under those facts?"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2647.574,2656.57,"Well, I'm not sure that he would, Your Honor, because possession is a strange word within the group of words in the statute."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.748,2751.673,"So all you're proving, all you're suggesting is that in the appropriate case it's easy to prove the requisite intent, and it's hard to prove it in a case such as the one I hypothesized."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2757.407,2771.655,"--Well, I think that your questions lead to an important point, which is the question of will people have any idea that what they're doing is wrong, what they're doing is potentially punishable or subject to federal regulation."
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.262,2904.013,Isn't there something to the your opponent's contention at least that isn't completely disposed of by saying it's an ignorance of the law defense; that there the statute itself in one of its clauses speaks of awareness or what have you and the fact that it's not permitted?
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2904.013,2919.232,"--There's no doubt that Congress can and has made awareness either of the law or of some legal attendant circumstance an element of a defense, and I think Congress did that, for example, in 2024(c) where it made knowledge of some type of impropriety."
1984.84-5108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.224,2977.031,"Well, but don't you think that the language you're just talking about is... when you add to it the language"
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3005.539,3023.781,"Well, there is no doubt that some type of knowledge has been made an element of the offense, but I think the language of 2024(b), if construed the way petitioner suggests, would lead to peculiar consequences, given its use of the"
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.574,3276.197,But you do agree that subsection (c) requires specific intent.
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3276.197,3279.238,"Well, specific intent I think is a confusing phrase."
1984.84-5108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.238,3281.189,"Or whatever... mens rea, at least knowledge of wrongdoing."
1984.84-5108,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3281.189,3283.721,Knowledge that the stamps were acquired in the manner described.
1984.84-5108,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3343.42,3348.272,"You have four minutes, five minutes remaining, Mr. Huyck."
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3348.272,3349.574,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.84-5108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3470.255,3471.615,How does that affect your client?
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3471.615,3472.556,--Pardon me?
1984.84-5108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3472.556,3474.096,Did your client get those regulations?
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3474.096,3474.807,No.
1984.84-5108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3475.608,3476.698,Of course not.
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3478.49,3486.575,"--That's an example of someone who could be prosecuted under the Government's example... reading of the statute; however, they probably never would."
1984.84-5108,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3496.392,3514.704,"Mr. Huyck, in your view would an instruction by the court in this case telling the jury that if the defendant had reason to know the stamps were unlawfully acquired, would that have been sufficient in your view?"
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3514.704,3515.232,--Yes.
1984.84-5108,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3518.314,3520.856,So you don't think that it requires actual knowledge.
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3526.001,3526.422,Yes.
1984.84-5108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3533.324,3538.527,"Of course, you're dealing with a statute where the adverb is ""knowingly""."
1984.84-5108,2,44902,william_thomas_huyck,,3552.999,3566.858,"Well, here again, if we're going to have an era where federal trial courts are going to more precisely instruct juries on mental intent than they have with this boilerplate instruction I used in this case, probably there's going to have to be some guidance."
1984.84-5108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3645.488,3647.411,"Thank you, gentlemen."
