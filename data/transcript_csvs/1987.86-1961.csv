1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.641,"Mr. Rose, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,13.641,28.139,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,112.035,115.137,"Mr. Rose, incidentally, did the decedent die in the hospital?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,115.137,116.88,"--Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,116.88,126.197,Why weren't they then on some kind of notice that there was an estate probably to be probated?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,126.197,126.928,"Well, that--"
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,126.928,128.707,They certainly knew her address.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,128.707,130.017,"--Yes, that's true, Your Honor."
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,161.169,162.358,Was this a Tulsa hospital?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,162.358,163.179,"Yes, it was."
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,163.179,169.875,It is certainly a less sympathetic case than if your creditor were off in New York or somewhere.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,169.875,173.287,It is not the ideal case to present the issue.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,197.432,204.328,"Well, certainly, I've known of hospitals that routinely watch the legal notices in legal newspapers--"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,204.328,205.169,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,205.169,209.732,--or they go down and check the probate office and get their claim in.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,209.732,210.313,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.313,221.032,"Your hospital just sat by and let it go, even though the death was in Tulsa and even though the decedent was a Tulsa resident."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,221.032,221.313,Yes.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,223.196,225.006,"Well, isn't it so?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,225.006,225.757,It is not so.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,250.263,259.209,"Well, that is a peculiar Oklahoma quirk, I suppose, but how does it really affect your case?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,259.209,278.983,"In that situation, it is not... it has historically been the case that you do not have to file a creditor's claim to collect a bill--"
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.983,282.534,The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held otherwise in this case.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,282.534,282.725,--That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.681,363.823,"And the later it goes, the less time you have to file."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,370.508,371.009,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.009,375.022,"So, you theoretically have to keep reading the newspapers for--"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,375.022,378.094,That is the difficulty with the whole case.
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.484,441.658,--Can you file a claim before the notice goes out?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,441.658,453.536,"You can file a claim, but the difficulty is in discovering that a probate case is filed."
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.667,456.039,"You don't think that's so hard, do you?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,456.039,456.748,Pardon me?
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.748,458.661,"You don't really think that's so hard, do you?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,458.661,460.801,To determine whether the probate case is filed?
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.444,479.749,"I would think particularly representing a collection agency, as you do, that would be quite a staple of their business."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,479.749,505.577,"Well, again, in the context of this case and the way it arose, the fact that this Section 594 Title 58 had been relied on historically for the proposition that all funeral expenses and expenses of last illness are supposed to be paid, no mention of a claim, that is something that the hospital had done."
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.588,561.661,You don't acknowledge you have actual notice.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,563.772,565.474,Of what?
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.465,567.866,Of the death.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,567.866,569.177,Because the--
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.177,570.898,The death doesn't start anything running at all.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,570.898,571.509,--That's right.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.195,579.416,You could say the same thing about the creditor of a contract claim.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,586.932,607.805,"That's true, and I think that you may be making reference to this Court's decision in the 1953 New York v. New York-New Haven Railroad Company, where this Court decided that mailed notice was required to creditors of that debtor."
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.429,614.48,That was decided as a matter of constitutional law?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,614.48,616.073,I believe so.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.176,655.039,"It just occurred to me, there's only one probate court in Tulsa, isn't there?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,655.039,656.321,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.321,658.194,"So, it's only one court you have to watch?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,658.194,658.594,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,684.786,687.039,"Well, once every sixty days."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,687.039,706.992,"You could do that and you could do that for up to apparently at least twenty-six years throughout... for every debtor that you had in every county in Oklahoma, and in every county and every state that also has a short-term non-claim statute, such as we have in Oklahoma."
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.992,709.244,But you wouldn't have had to do it very long in this case?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,709.244,711.945,"In this particular case, that's correct."
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.945,713.327,"Well, that's the case we're judging."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,715.958,728.666,"The importance, though, is that we did not have notice of the initiation of the probate proceeding and the subsequent publication of notice to creditors."
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.666,730.737,"Well, that's true, that's true, but you could have had."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,730.737,732.279,We could have had.
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.349,746.709,"Oh, sure."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,746.709,749.422,--then we would have filed a claim.
1987.86-1961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.422,752.405,"Sure you would have, but you could have easily found out."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,762.552,776.41,"Well, again, in this case, this was under a different statutory scheme, that all I can tell you has been... was relied on since 1910 when the statute was enacted at the same time."
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,776.41,778.033,--You're a professional organization.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,779.203,780.995,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.995,788.65,"This isn't an inordinate... I mean, if it's too much for you to send somebody by there once a week?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,788.65,790.292,"Well, again,--"
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.292,793.414,Do you check the legal papers?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,793.414,796.506,--I think that the focus should be--
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.506,798.208,What else do you do other than bill people?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,798.208,800.559,--That's it.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.715,861.56,That hypothesizes a truly massive business of collection which would extend to every county in Oklahoma and every county in every other state of the Union.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,867.524,869.687,"That is precisely my point, and that is--"
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,869.687,872.128,And all of them paying fees.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,872.128,874.12,--Pardon me?
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,874.12,876.27,And all of them paying fees.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,878.633,879.332,For?
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.332,882.975,For the services that your company gives.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,882.975,883.276,Correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,883.276,884.448,You get paid for it.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,884.448,885.249,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,885.249,889.483,"So, the more you have, the more you have to look out for."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,889.483,890.084,Okay.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.328,910.526,"Do you think that Oklahoma should direct their laws particularly to cooperate with you, to your company?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,910.526,914.057,--To cooperate with all creditors that are similarly situated.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,914.057,914.217,Or the public in general.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,914.217,914.748,Pardon me?
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,914.748,917.111,Or in the public in general.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,917.111,920.293,"Well, it's for everyone."
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,921.604,926.169,Not just at you because you have to go to every county--
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,926.169,927.06,--That's exactly right.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,927.06,928.079,--and every state.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,928.079,928.88,That's exactly right.
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,928.88,932.323,"Well, Oklahoma should look out for you then specially."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,932.323,937.628,"No, not specially, but in conjunction with all other creditors."
1987.86-1961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.628,941.179,"Well, I mean, a single creditor wouldn't have all that trouble, would he?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,948.554,949.345,On the hospital.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,949.345,951.478,And when was the assignment made?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,951.478,954.54,The assignment from the hospital to the collection agency?
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,971.25,975.334,"When you say that then, the real creditor is still the hospital."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,975.334,975.754,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,975.754,986.422,And I can't get much sympathy for your argument about every county and every state when you have a Tulsa decedent and a Tulsa hospital and the Tulsa probate.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,995.227,996.379,It's in the county of residence.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,999.521,1006.076,But in... this decedent was a resident of this particular county.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1006.076,1007.396,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1007.396,1014.032,"I can't see the great burden that is on your client, either the hospital or the collection agency."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1017.504,1019.504,"Again, when you focus on one--"
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1019.504,1023.428,Isn't that what this case is about?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1023.958,1024.809,--It certainly is.
1987.86-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1036.348,1045.801,"Mr. Rose, has any... have the lower courts determined precisely what it is the hospital had actual notice of?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1045.801,1046.563,"No, they have not."
1987.86-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1046.563,1051.466,Whether the hospital did have actual knowledge of a probate proceeding?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1051.466,1051.807,"No, no."
1987.86-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1055.5,1060.025,"The stipulated facts just is that the hospital knew of the death, obviously."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1060.025,1060.275,--That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.477,1062.569,"But no other finding, is there?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1062.569,1063.257,--No other findings.
1987.86-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1063.257,1074.176,"Well, if, in fact, the hospital had actual knowledge of the probate proceeding, do you lose?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1074.176,1080.49,"In this case, without the filing of a claim, yes."
1987.86-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1081.338,1082.199,You concede that?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1082.199,1082.63,Yes.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.63,1099.633,"Didn't you say a moment ago, and if you didn't say this, please, that in Mennonite, we decided the general notice question, although in that particular case, the claimant had had notice, had had actual notice?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1099.633,1112.85,"Well, the reference I made to Mennonite was that the notice of the delinquency of taxes was not the same thing as the notice of the pendency of a sale."
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.949,1126.891,"Since that might have taken place considerably later, is your point."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1126.891,1127.291,--Pardon me?
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.291,1131.845,Since the probate proceeding might have been commenced considerably after the death.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1131.845,1132.516,"Certainly, certainly."
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.516,1155.212,"I think before we got into all the factual background of the case, you were beginning to say why this was like Mennonite, that you thought there was a property interest here."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1155.212,1155.713,Right.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.91,1213.333,"Of course, in the Mullane case, there was an existing interest in personal property."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1213.333,1214.225,That's true.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.225,1217.617,"And in Mennonite, there was an existing interest in real property."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1217.617,1218.038,That's true.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1218.038,1222.962,"And here you have what's traditionally just a claim in personam, a contract claim for payment."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1222.962,1223.163,That's true.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.528,1237.413,"But the law has always treated quite differently interests in property as opposed to contractual interests, has it not?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1237.413,1238.423,"Yes, it has."
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.803,1277.88,"Many, many things certainly can be property under our due process decisions that are not classical interests in personal property or real property, but, nonetheless, I think you probably have to deal with the proposition that traditionally a statute of limitations dealing with real property is much longer than a statute of limitations dealing with contract rights and that sort of thing."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1277.88,1278.36,True.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.289,1364.028,"The interest there, I suppose, of the state is not to ward off stale claims, but to say that after someone dies, it's imperative to wind up his affairs more rapidly and you simply relied on the statute of limitations."
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1364.028,1364.378,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.478,1392.103,You urge us that we should look upon them in two different ways.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1399.547,1400.899,There's a difficulty.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.899,1402.251,--There sure is.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1403.428,1403.809,You have to draw a line.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.527,1444.369,"Mr. Rose, what is it that cuts off your claim?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1452.375,1454.836,Yes.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.836,1460.74,"--and then a new probate proceeding is commenced, is your claim dead?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1460.74,1461.94,No.
1987.86-1961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.885,1493.001,"What is the notice is published, but the probate for some reason does not go through to completion?"
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1496.424,1502.649,"Well, I suppose... I don't know the answer off the top of my head."
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.548,1534.82,There are very few unsuccessful probates.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1534.82,1536.472,That's true.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1613.078,1614.748,Would you be satisfied with four months?
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1614.748,1616.498,--No.
1987.86-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1628.457,1630.29,Many other states have four months.
1987.86-1961,0,40355,randall_e_rose,,1632.801,1633.221,--Yes.
1987.86-1961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.177,1654.268,"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1656.391,1666.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1776.37,1779.354,"Well, that's just never been decided, I take it."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1779.354,1779.993,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1780.504,1783.354,Who knew what has not been decided.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1783.354,1783.825,--That's correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1789.85,1791.943,"If the case goes back, it can be determined?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1791.943,1793.112,--That's correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1804.251,1809.065,Do you also maintain that the hospital knew of the probate proceeding?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1809.065,1818.422,We do not maintain that they knew of the probate proceeding at the time that he died or that we gave them actual notice.
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1818.422,1820.704,"Well, I guess there wasn't a probate proceeding before he died."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1820.704,1821.044,That's right.
1987.86-1961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.56,1831.384,Just to get in my mind a couple of the dates here.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1841.071,1841.672,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.672,1849.819,And the first claim filed by the collection agency here was in October 1983?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1849.819,1851.91,That was not a claim.
1987.86-1961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.724,1874.505,That was the first appearance they had made in the probate action?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1874.505,1874.746,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.167,1879.23,Had there been any preliminary distributions from the estate?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1879.23,1880.782,No.
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1944.05,1967.468,"Mr. Smith, what if we had here a creditor from out of state with no knowledge of the death or the probate proceeding, do you think that publication notice under the Oklahoma statute would be... would meet due process requirements?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1967.468,1971.799,There is an exception as are several exceptions under the non-claims statute.
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.201,1976.643,If you know about them.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1976.643,1977.613,Sir?
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.613,1979.286,If you know about them.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1986.63,1986.97,Right.
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.237,1998.99,"Well, then, let's make it an in state creditor without any knowledge at all."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,1998.99,2007.215,"There are no exemptions made for in state creditors, just on the basis that they had no knowledge."
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2007.215,2010.716,"Well, that isn't my question."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2024.388,2025.597,No.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.4,2035.505,You would have to because actually all the Oklahoma law provides for the out of state creditors the longer period.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2037.715,2038.106,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.168,2041.571,"Once the decree is entered, he's out, whether he gives notice or not."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2041.571,2045.084,"He has until the final decree of distribution, which could be months or years, depending on the case."
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2045.084,2045.773,Right.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2050.808,2056.161,Notice was not given for two reasons.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2065.356,2068.579,"Well, the hospital bill was outstanding, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2068.579,2070.46,--The hospital bill was outstanding.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2087.19,2090.074,"Well, were you counsel for the estate and for her?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2090.074,2090.973,Yes.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2092.726,2095.065,"Well, did the firm share her belief?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2095.065,2098.76,I can't answer that as far--
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2098.76,2099.889,But you can answer my question.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2102.87,2106.463,"--Well, it wasn't required under the non-claims statute."
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2106.463,2112.199,Was it because they hoped they would avoid the filing of a claim and the necessity of paying it?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2112.199,2113.659,"No, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2114.41,2116.411,Are we playing games in Oklahoma?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2116.411,2117.062,--No.
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.833,2151.616,"Well, those claims had been filed, I take it."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2151.616,2152.865,"No, they weren't."
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.078,2155.419,She still paid them?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2155.419,2155.657,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.657,2156.868,But you knew about them and paid them?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2156.868,2157.479,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.479,2161.591,And you didn't give the hospital notice because you were relying on the public notice?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2161.591,2164.793,"Yes, sir, and we didn't recognize the claim of the hospital."
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2164.793,2177.964,Did you have any trouble with the IRS who would... I've known them in the past to insist on the formal filing and allowance of claims before they allow them as deductions.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2178.935,2185.707,We had no trouble with the IRS on that question and received releases from both tax entities.
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.26,2205.282,"Well, she would have had to pay it."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2205.282,2206.684,She would have had to pay it.
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2206.684,2218.093,"There certainly is a financial interest in the heirs at least in avoiding notice to creditors, isn't there?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2225.237,2226.228,That's true.
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.681,2232.612,Do you think the Constitution would require that you give at least public notice?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2232.612,2239.628,--I believe that public notice is required under the due process clause.
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.628,2240.349,Why?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2240.349,2246.914,Because of the uncertainty of determining who and who is not a creditor.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.619,2270.568,"What do you mean, the uncertainty of knowing who... you say unscrupulous administrator or executor might not notify known creditors."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2283.659,2288.07,As well as pay any valid debts.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.542,2292.615,"Well, but a debt's not valid if it's not presented in time."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2293.456,2294.497,--That's correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.497,2299.31,He has an obligation to make sure that everybody doesn't file in time and files in time.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2322.656,2337.416,"I still believe that under the oath of office that an executor takes, they are under a duty to not only protect the rights of the heirs and the property interests, but also to pay any valid debts of the estate."
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.463,2356.259,"Is the obligation to pay debts valid when all the debts are in and if these are never presented,--"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2356.259,2356.539,That's true.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.539,2357.651,--they're not valid debts?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2357.651,2358.702,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2384.69,2391.366,"Well, in response to that, I know of at least four jurisdictions where that is not true."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2391.366,2396.147,"In Oklahoma, it is the practice."
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2397.958,2401.881,"You made the statement you thought it was generally the practice, and I questioned that one."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2401.881,2420.034,"--In Oklahoma, excuse me, insurance payments continue to be made by the employer sponsored insurance carrier until approximately February of 1980."
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.164,2471.896,How is the person supposed to do it if the creditor doesn't know about the opening of the estate?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2471.896,2479.383,"--Well, the creditor, we maintain, is supposed to monitor those accounts that they have to collect."
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.383,2485.667,"Well, why do they give this exception... the exception for the out of state people is because they don't read the newspapers that the Oklahoma citizens have available to them."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2485.987,2489.209,I would assume because they wouldn't have access to the newspapers.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.209,2494.555,But the ordinary creditor has to read all the legal publications to protect himself or herself.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2494.555,2496.505,That would be correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.505,2500.539,And we haven't talked much about whether the statute is constitutional.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2506.894,2507.415,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.415,2510.856,Sixty days.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2510.856,2512.198,Sixty days.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.3,2522.444,Sixty days plus the period of time between the date of death and the time the publication is made.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2528.659,2539.208,The original hearing cannot be less than ten days or more than thirty days from whenever the petition is filed.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.208,2541.408,It is usually filed within a couple of weeks.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2541.408,2547.783,"In this case, it was a period of over five months that they had to file their claim."
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.766,2582.529,What's the big deal about notifying known creditors?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2586.971,2593.414,We don't argue with the idea that actual notice is preferable in most all cases.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.42,2622.836,"Yes, but for purposes of our decision in reviewing the court below, they assumed for purposes of decision that she may well have known them and still didn't have to give them notice."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2633.296,2635.918,"No, that has not been tried."
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.918,2649.606,"So, don't we have to, to decide this case, assume that everybody knew... that she knew the facts and could well have given notice and wouldn't have slowed anything up at all if she said, well, I don't think the hospital bill is paid, I think I ought to write them a letter?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2649.606,2673.491,"We maintain that to do that causes a burden upon personal representatives who are not always the spouse of the decedent, to find out exactly who the creditors are, and this is a genuine problem where personal representatives who has some times only desks or drawers of papers to go through in order to determine who the creditors are."
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.491,2685.018,"Yes, but the question Justice Stevens poses is whatever kind of administrator you have, if the administrator actually knows of a creditor, must he give them notice."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2685.018,2691.954,Not under this statute.
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.954,2699.4,"Well, the question is, does the Constitution require more."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2699.4,2701.12,I don't believe so.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2766.544,2769.556,I come back to the facts of this case.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2780.725,2785.828,She had prior experience with this hospital.
1987.86-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2785.828,2791.541,"If the executor were the First National Bank of Tulsa, if you have one, they certainly would have investigated it."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2791.541,2808.241,"This goes outside the record again, but to answer your question, a personal representative, the wife of the deceased, had prior experiences with this hospital and with this husband and with this insurance carrier in which she never had to pay a dime."
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.238,2826.646,"Well, sooner or later, it became evident that the hospital was and that the bill was unpaid."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2826.646,2827.517,The--
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.517,2836.932,And is there some rule in Oklahoma that an administrator can't pay a valid debt after the claims period has run?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2836.932,2837.673,"--No, sir."
1987.86-1961,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.073,2855.296,"Then, there was no doubt that the bill was valid, was there?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2855.296,2857.787,There was in her mind.
1987.86-1961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2905.591,2916.59,"If we rule in favor of the Appellant, is there a concern that the cost of probate will escalate because the cost of executor bonds will be higher, etcetera?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2916.59,2919.77,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, that is one concern."
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2951.832,2997.731,"Mr. Smith, suppose Oklahoma wants to provide an easy way for its citizens to get credit, to re-establish their credit, so it provides for a declaratory judgment scheme in which you can file a declaratory judgment action seeking to have a pronouncement that there are no outstanding debts against you or exactly what claims there are against you, and it adopts the same system we have here, you simply have public notice of the suit by publishing it in a newspaper and any creditor who doesn't come in within sixty days, asserting a claim, shall be barred, and you'll get a declaratory judgment that that debt is no longer relevant, do you think that would be constitutional?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,2997.731,3004.317,"--I would ask, does the debtor have knowledge of the identity of the creditors in that case, and if so,--"
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.317,3004.487,Yes.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3004.487,3005.298,--Excuse me.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.298,3007.05,Does the debtor have knowledge?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3007.23,3008.091,Yes.
1987.86-1961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.368,3022.331,"Now, why is this different?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3027.556,3033.441,"Because in this case, there was no declaratory judgment nor are there in probate matters."
1987.86-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3125.185,3139.244,How do you distinguish the City of New York case holding that notice by publication was not sufficient for creditors in filing claims in a bankruptcy estate?
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3139.244,3146.239,--I think part of the answer goes to the nature of a bankruptcy versus the nature of a probate action.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.232,3228.458,"Mr. Smith, is there any provision in the Oklahoma Probate Code that requires the executor or the administrator to make any kind of representation to the court that all known debts have been paid?"
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3228.458,3234.853,There is not currently a requirement.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.018,3245.169,No.
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3259.79,3260.271,Right.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.484,3357.367,"This applies, of course, not just to people doing business, but this could have been his cousin at the other side of the state who loaned him money."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3357.367,3358.168,--That's correct.
1987.86-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.168,3361.28,"So, it's not just people that are in business, it's any debt."
1987.86-1961,1,38340,phillip_k_smith,,3361.28,3362.432,People who do business.
1987.86-1961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3419.921,3420.572,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1987.86-1961,2,40355,randall_e_rose,,3423.745,3427.738,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1961,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3504.688,3511.714,"But, Mr. Rose, if you win, doesn't the case have to go back for trial on the question of whether the administrator actually knew about the claim?"
1987.86-1961,2,40355,randall_e_rose,,3511.714,3517.518,"--Well, not if... that would be fine."
1987.86-1961,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3522.5,3538.799,"If the only constitutional requirement is that the people who have actual notice be... I mean, people of whom the decedent's representative actually knew to have claims, your client would not prevail unless she knew that there was an outstanding claim."
1987.86-1961,2,40355,randall_e_rose,,3538.799,3539.29,Okay.
1987.86-1961,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3540.712,3542.244,And that has not yet been adjudicated.
1987.86-1961,2,40355,randall_e_rose,,3542.244,3542.693,That's correct.
1987.86-1961,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3586.614,3589.255,"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
