1975.74-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.012,"Mr. Baum, I think you may proceed now."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,28.012,31.23,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-744,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.541,358.514,Mr. Baum?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,358.514,358.955,Yes Mr. Justice.
1975.74-744,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.955,364.462,Bring me up to date on the facts about Mr. Shapiro. Is he back in his country?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,364.462,366.221,"He is in Israel now, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,366.221,368.143,Has he been tried over there?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,368.143,371.107,He has not been tried as far as we are aware.
1975.74-744,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,371.107,372.135,Is he free on bond over there?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,372.135,374.349,He is free on bond.
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.069,424.252,At what stage of the proceeding was that affidavit filed?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,424.252,427.555,"After the decision of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.555,443.309,"This is -- one thing that kind of raises some problems for me about the case is that, are we entitled to consider in reviewing the judgment of the Court of Appeals proceedings that transpired after the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the District Court?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,443.309,454.288,"I would like to say in response to that, if Your Honor please, if the proceedings in a District Court were dismissed before any question was raised about the non-receipt of the notice."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.184,466.823,"So, both the contention and the response occurred in the post Court of Appeals hearing in the district --?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,466.823,468.472,"Part of my best recollection is, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.472,476.455,"Is that not a matter that should be litigated and if this case goes back, there would be a point that it would be litigated?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,476.455,479.701,"If that were all to be litigated, we would not be here, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-744,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,479.701,480.712,It is not my question.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,482.831,483.528,We think we have established it.
1975.74-744,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,483.528,489.544,"After somebody says “Yes” and somebody else says “No”, that is litigation in my book."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,489.544,490.728,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.749,501.592,"If this case would proceed without us ruling with you, that would be one of the points that would be litigated."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,501.592,510.78,"There are numerous decisions, Mr. Justice Marshall, which hold that in a case of internal revenue notices, there is no statutory requirement that they would be received."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.938,683.929,Do you know Mr. Baum whether the Court of Appeals had any precise civil procedure type of thing in mind?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,690.231,693.266,I think Your Honor has asked me two questions and I would like to answer them.
1975.74-744,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.598,754.092,May I ask Mr. Baum about (Voice Overlap) that paragraph 5 it does not -- may I properly draw the influence from this that they are talking about a probable cause here?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,754.092,754.609,I did not hear you.
1975.74-744,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,754.609,757.506,A probable cause hearing.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,766.088,768.867,"You could call it that, Your Honor, yes."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.284,778.0,"Well, we are in the context with the rules of civil procedure here I take it."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,784.675,795.812,"And the rules of Civil procedure, if Your Honor please, require that the taxpayer, the plaintiff must establish by some means that there has been some taint of illegality in this assessment."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.584,821.043,"Well, the rules of simple procedure do not necessarily supplant whatever may have been said in Enochs. Conceivably, Enochs may mean that the government has to file an answer in a case like that, but do you know of any provision in the rules of civil procedure that talks about a probable cause hearing?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,821.043,824.911,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.256,893.3,"Well, is not Mr. Shapiro’s contention here that all of a sudden this just came like a bolt out of the blue and if the government did not tell him why they were after him, he had no way of evaluating their claim or arguing that it was baseless?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,893.3,905.692,"He says that, Your Honor, but the Notice of Deficiency which was before the District Court and the Court of Appeals states that for the year 1970, he had $18,000.00 in unexplained bank deposits."
1975.74-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1047.199,1067.558,"Instead of responding as he did in the conclusion terms, he had submitted a certified copy of a final decree of his grandmother’s estate showing that at the time of these deposits inherited precisely or substantially that amount, would you say that would have carried the taxpayer’s burden?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1067.558,1073.132,"I would think so, Your Honor, as to that branch of the case. Of course, that would not affect the narcotics transactions."
1975.74-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1073.132,1079.461,"Well, it would not affect -- it would not with finality determine all of the tax aspects either, would it not?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1079.461,1082.131,No it would not Your Honor.
1975.74-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.051,1090.391,What burden would it have on the jeopardy assessment?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1090.391,1106.875,"If what I think allow the court some basis for coming in and saying, “Now Mr. Commissioner, it is incumbent upon you to examine the -- to acquaintance us with the facts underlying this case.”"
1975.74-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.875,1110.039,As the condition to the continued impoundment?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1110.039,1111.818,That is correct.
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.818,1114.044,Where would this showing be made?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1114.044,1115.05,In the District Court.
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.05,1126.82,"In the District Court, so you do not -- you say that it is proper to file this suit and it is just in face of the Anti-injunction Act and that one or the other, the party is going to show something?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1126.82,1128.761,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1130.866,1142.979,Would some of the problem that is followed here have been saved if the government simply filed an answer to the complaint for an injunction outlining in very tough form the basis for the imposition of the tax?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1142.979,1151.034,"I doubt that it would, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because some of the government’s evidence was based upon confidential informants that would not have been (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1151.034,1158.315,"Well, under the pleadings we have now you do not answer in great detail as to what witnesses will testify."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1164.347,1170.012,"Well, I submit that is what we did when we filed a notice of deficiency on the 21st of December 1973."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.012,1170.226,Yes.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1175.945,1179.547,"Well, I do not think that changes it, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.195,1233.941,"Indeed, you can enforce the commissioner to come forward by discovery under the Court of Appeals rule?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1233.941,1234.814,That is correct.
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.814,1236.972,Long before he could on the tax --
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.972,1247.716,(Inaudible) He had his company locked up and he cannot get it.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1247.716,1248.521,He cannot get it.
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.278,1266.994,"Well, I suppose that you would assume it because (Inaudible) and he would go forward in the tax court and the Court of Appeals said you ought to show something if you are going to hold this property."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1266.994,1301.332,"But if Your Honor please, this has been in existence since 1924 and we have been using this statute in a direct statutory purpose as contained in the statute is to shorten the time and, that is why the 60-day period for giving a statutory notice of deficiency, allowing him to go to the tack, but we may not sell the property, we can only hold it and having accelerated the whole statutory scheme, that is what the Congress and which has been upheld many, many times."
1975.74-744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.632,1354.798,"By the time he filed his complaint in the District Court and am I right in understanding that all he knew was that he was scheduled to be deported or rather extradited in a very short time and that the United States government had seized all of his assets in the United States and he knew nothing else, is that not right?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1356.493,1357.181,That is correct.
1975.74-744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.181,1370.041,"So, it would then be incumbent upon the government to file something as a pleading in that court to allow the District Court to apply the very test that this Court has established in the Enochs case."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1379.222,1390.6,"But then in every jeopardy case, Your Honor, we would have been accused of seizing a man’s property and proceeding without any basis for him to challenge and he would then get an immediate trial --"
1975.74-744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.6,1390.886,No.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1404.135,1407.67,"Well, I think what happened here discloses it."
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.714,1429.109,"(Voice Overlap) but you say that the – you are mostly dismissed and said, “Dismiss this case because in fact the taxpayer has given his burden.”"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1429.109,1430.248,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.248,1444.338,"And that is the fact that if there be any burden at all, it would be -- if he only knows as if you have seized his property and he says, “I do not know any tax and I have no idea why the government thinks I owe some tax.”"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1451.482,1455.503,"Well, that as I submit what we did, Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.503,1462.576,You filed a motion to dismiss which says in effect that the complaint does not state a claim.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1472.846,1486.914,"We filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Your Honor, which was in accordance with this Court’s holdings and the rules provide that on a motion to dismiss, the court may consider affidavits in and other materials in deciding the motion."
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1486.914,1487.939,Mr. Baum.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1487.939,1489.343,Yes Mr. Justice.
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1489.343,1493.574,I do not think you filed a definitive affidavit until after the decision (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1493.574,1495.709,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1495.709,1502.589,"That prompts me to ask a question I think was alluded to by one of the other justices earlier, what is before us?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1525.131,1528.057,"That is a very anomalous situation, Your Honor."
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1554.574,1556.737,May I ask this?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1587.3,1591.85,"It could, Your Honor, because we submit that there is no longer any showing of irreparable (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1591.85,1598.211,That is good under Enochs and under the decision of the Court of Appeals so that brings me back to my question.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1605.964,1615.229,"Well, of course, we would prefer that you look at what you granted certiorari to consider because we think that it is a misapplication of Your Honor's opinion of two years ago."
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.229,1620.218,You say you were not required in order to get relief to file what you filed in the District Court?
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1620.218,1621.42,That is correct.
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.872,1684.855,"But, your position of sitting on it until the tax court acts and you say you do not have to prove anything until then?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1684.855,1691.751,Until the taxpayer has come forward with some showing that this assessment is made out of whole cloth.
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1703.677,1714.431,"If you had filed the affidavit initially, that was ultimately filed after the decision of the Court of Appeals, you probably would not be here today, would you?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1714.431,1719.782,"I doubt that, Your Honor, because the District Judge said the affidavit was wholly insufficient."
1975.74-744,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1721.709,1722.068,Right.
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.217,1728.437,"Originally, the District Court dismissed?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1728.437,1734.217,"The District Court originally dismissed in (Voice Overlap) of Williams Packing, yes Your Honor he did and --"
1975.74-744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.217,1737.632,A fortiori if you had filed something more than just your motion.
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1738.313,1744.527,"Well, he did not think it made any difference at that point and his mind has been changed, at least for the time being."
1975.74-744,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1744.527,1754.403,"So I suppose, he feel he has too much government -- the government is forcing him out of the country on the one hand and then taking all of his property away from him on the other?"
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1754.403,1764.954,"Well, I hardly think it is fair to say that the government is forcing him out of the country. It is his home government that was requesting his presence for an urgent appointment with a criminal court there."
1975.74-744,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1764.954,1767.419,"Well, he has been extradited."
1975.74-744,0,17311,baum,,1767.419,1786.213,"Lastly if I may, if the Court please, I would like to point out that the Court of Appeals did rely on two decisions namely Pizzarello and Lucia, Pizzarello in the Second Circuit and Lucia in the Fifth Circuit and both of those, I think illustrate the point that possibly you Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White were making."
1975.74-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.635,1830.94,"(Inaudible) Right now, I have been waiting to get your reaction to it, somewhat to point that Justice Powell was pursuing."
1975.74-744,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1878.886,1888.172,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that as matters develop subsequent to Mr. Shapiro’s return to Israel, it is true that that factor was dropped out of the case."
1975.74-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.825,1890.796,Is that the fulcrum of this opinion?
1975.74-744,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1890.796,1897.291,"At the time, the Court of Appeals reviewed the case that was the basis that we were relying on to establish irreparable injury."
1975.74-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.466,1952.684,What evidence is there in this record that these constitute his entire assets since he has now apparently been able to make bail in Israel?
1975.74-744,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1952.684,1968.677,"Well, the representation that we made to the District Court, Mr. Chief Justice, was that he may bail because a relative came forward at the last moment and posted in apartment as security, a relative who had no legal obligation to Mr. Shapiro, but simply out of a family feeling rather than seeing him in jail for an extended period."
