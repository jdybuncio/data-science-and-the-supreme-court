2011.10-948,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We will hear argument next in case 10-948, CompuCredit Corporation v. Greenwood."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,10.256,13.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-948,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,66.108,73.596,"Well, that statute didn't have as this one has a disclosure requirement that says you have a right to sue."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,73.596,76.833,And that's the sole distinction between the two statutes.
2011.10-948,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,76.833,77.633,"Well, but it's a meaningful one."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,77.633,100.532,"So the -- first of all the disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms, gives a quick description of an operative civil liability section which is set out in 1679(g) and which tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a cause of action."
2011.10-948,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,122.779,124.814,"Suppose it said something different, Mr. McConnell."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,148.429,151.798,"--Justice Kagan, I think that would be exactly the same."
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.558,182.401,"Mr. McConnell, you started with the notion that the disclosure provision, the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people and if an ordinary person not schooled in the law read"
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,190.606,204.683,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, in the ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC sends discriminated against workers a right-to-sue letter that tells them they have a right to sue."
2011.10-948,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,239.272,256.818,"Can you imagine any statutory language that would eliminate the right, the ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration agreement other than language that expressly prohibits the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of arbitration?"
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,256.818,259.401,"Yes, Justice Alito, I can imagine it."
2011.10-948,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,332.716,343.34,"Mr. McConnell, the cases that you cite in support of your position rest on a distinction between procedural rights and substantive rights, which you invoke here."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,361.55,368.806,"First of all, only our waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we have a second argument."
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.62,508.646,But the -- the act in Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as a right within the non-waivable provision.
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,508.646,514.117,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg and the question is does it matter."
2011.10-948,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,604.757,612.713,"Do you think a -- the word ""lawsuit"" typically describes an arbitration proceeding?"
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,617.184,619.317,I do not think so.
2011.10-948,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,619.317,622.838,"Well, why doesn't a right to sue refer to a lawsuit?"
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,622.838,629.908,"It refers to a cause of action, Your Honor, and we can call that a lawsuit, too."
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,689.28,697.886,"You know, if this were written to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you would have a stronger argument."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,721.184,731.69,"--Justice Ginsburg, again, if that is so, it would apply to other cases in which the language ""right to sue"" is used."
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,745.3,747.152,Is that in -- is that in the statute?
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,749.185,753.056,"--It's in the regulations, Your Honor."
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.056,755.758,"--Yes, but Title VII doesn't say ""right to sue""."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,764.78,768.315,"Well, what the statute says is you may bring a suit in court."
2011.10-948,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.896,792.348,One way you could do it is that the right to sue is more familiar colloquially.
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,802.655,826.002,We have -- there is no reason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure provision toward the end of the drafting of this statute and simply used a colloquial version of cause of action so that ordinary people would understand that they intended to change the meaning of the operative provision.
2011.10-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.925,875.852,"In the standard arbitration agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?"
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,875.852,879.906,I don't--
2011.10-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,879.906,881.256,"I mean, doesn't that happen rather often?"
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,881.256,882.94,--It does happen rather often.
2011.10-948,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.081,899.95,And of course the suits are brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration award.
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,899.95,902.319,"Exactly, Exactly."
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.29,936.992,But this is not what the parties decide.
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,953.537,960.524,That is an argument against arbitration that this Court has rejected several times.
2011.10-948,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,960.524,965.909,It's a question of whether we take that into account in -- in determining what
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,968.261,976.034,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, Congress -- that's a policy question and Congress has given us an answer."
2011.10-948,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1041.892,1044.844,Except if Congress indicates otherwise and--
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1044.844,1046.546,Unless Congress has indicated otherwise.
2011.10-948,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1046.546,1074.78,"--And I guess the problem here is that there is this language in this disclosure provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform consumers about -- about their rights and about where they are going to end up resolving their disputes, and it says you have a right to sue, and you are asking us essentially to read that language as: You have a right to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form contract."
2011.10-948,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1078.767,1091.742,"Justice Kagan, I do not see how it would be any different from a consumer who reads any of the statutes that this Court has held are subject to arbitration."
2011.10-948,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1180.383,1181.733,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1193.374,1195.726,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-948,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1209.652,1218.175,Does that mean that there is a violation of the statute the minute one of these organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration clause?
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1221.477,1236.303,"--There is -- there is a technical violation in asking, because in 1679f not only are waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is prohibited to ask someone to waive their rights."
2011.10-948,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1289.604,1311.351,"Well, doesn't that reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress would have intended -- without any discussion in the legislative history -- and our case law has said you have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the language of the statute, its context, and its history."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1316.671,1328.579,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want to take that in two parts, because the first was -- was tied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and whether that calls into question whether Congress really could have meant this."
2011.10-948,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1393.936,1408.912,"Well, Mr. Nelson, but your friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void arbitration agreements."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1419.57,1426.291,"--First of all, the rules -- the rules are not that Congress has to be especially clear in this context."
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.228,1483.746,Right.
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1529.791,1536.262,"Justice Scalia, I think it's not a strange way at all but a very direct way in the context here."
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.657,1617.499,Do you think Gilmer would have come out differently with regard to one of the procedural rights involved in that case if the statute had happened to refer to procedural right as a right?
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1619.701,1621.718,"Yes, they are definitely rights, and--"
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.718,1630.926,"And so if the statute in Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in passing as a right, do you think that one would have been nonwaivable?"
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1630.926,1639.346,--I think that if Congress had expressly denominated something in that statute as a right--
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.346,1640.762,But procedural rights are rights.
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1642.631,1647.516,"--Well, but the question is does any right refer to both procedural and substantive rights."
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.516,1648.066,--Exactly.
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1648.066,1650.368,Which is what this Court held did not in Payette.
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.509,1669.198,"But you're saying -- in answer to my question you're saying that just because the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just as we do."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1680.571,1698.968,"--I think if Congress makes clear in the statute that what it means when it's talking about rights includes procedural rights and then it has a provision that says: any right under this statute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very strong inference that Congress meant what it said."
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.751,1704.102,You are effectively referring to a procedural right as a right creates any inference at all.
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1706.138,1718.196,"--It is a right, and when Congress has said -- I mean many of these statutes such as Title VII and FELA don't say that rights are nonwaiverable."
2011.10-948,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.218,1733.206,What else is nonwaivable besides the three days to back out?
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1733.206,1748.815,"Well the other thing that this statute makes nonwaivable besides rights is protections, which is a phrase that hasn't been tied to anything defined in the statute."
2011.10-948,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1809.92,1825.264,"Do you know, Mr. Nelson, whether this statute is unique in this sense: Do you know of any other statute that arguably voids arbitration agreements without saying that they are voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement?"
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1825.264,1829.001,No.
2011.10-948,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.571,1957.098,"Would your position of right to a lawsuit, would that extend to a post-dispute genuinely bargained for right to arbitrate?"
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1957.098,1998.575,"No, I think not, Justice Ginsburg, and for this reason: The Court has always differentiated between post dispute settlements of claims and pre-dispute waivers, and has not considered agreements to settle, absent very special either statutory language such as in the ADEA which does apply a waiver provision to some types of settlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act where there's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting certain kinds of settlements."
2011.10-948,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.508,2093.387,"Another argument that is made, and perhaps to your position, is that the statute says that any waiver of any protection or right may not be enforced by any court or any other person."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2107.379,2125.191,"Well I don't think that it necessarily contemplates an alternative dispute mechanism, because I think, for example, that would bar -- when someone goes to court to compel arbitration, they are enforcing an arbitration agreement by bringing an enforcement action."
2011.10-948,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2206.329,2218.637,"What about the argument that the consumer retains the right to sue since they can go into court with their complaint, but it's simply the rule that the court will apply is that you have to proceed to arbitration?"
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2218.637,2232.479,"Well, I think it's -- it would be a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue that meant you could file a complaint that was mandatorily subject to decision elsewhere."
2011.10-948,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2235.129,2238.098,But that's frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues come up.
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2238.816,2239.766,--Certainly.
2011.10-948,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2239.766,2250.524,"--You cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement or any other provision, they will bring their complaint in court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2250.524,2270.419,"But -- but all that has been resolved in that -- in that suit is not the plaintiff's claim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue on, all that's resolved is the issue of whether he has a contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has breached by going into court."
2011.10-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2300.189,2305.825,Can you -- can you get -- can you get damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the arbitration?
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2305.825,2318.252,"--No, I don't think you would generally have that entitlement under any -- any rule of law that is -- that is normally applicable in American courts."
2011.10-948,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2374.355,2377.124,"You agree, I take it, that you would lose if the statute said"
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2378.657,2380.159,Yes.
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.701,2453.005,"Well -- well I guess it goes farther than that, your argument does, it seems to me."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2489.714,2490.714,--Justice Scalia--
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.714,2491.614,--when it says rights are not waived?
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2505.989,2509.175,"--Well, I -- I'm not really sure there are other procedural rights in the statute."
2011.10-948,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.175,2510.21,"Oh, there are -- none."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2510.21,2523.268,"I mean, unless -- the right to cancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a procedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think it -- it probably would -- would generally be categorized as a substantive right."
2011.10-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.451,2575.486,Suppose the case were reversed.
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2582.54,2583.307,Well--
2011.10-948,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2583.307,2586.192,"It seems to me that under your -- well, I will let you answer."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2586.192,2590.679,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, let -- let me divide it up."
2011.10-948,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2631.406,2640.262,"Mr. Nelson, you just said if the liability section said you have a right to sue that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action that's not okay."
2011.10-948,1,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2649.367,2658.639,"Well, when you say ""colloquial"", I'm not -- I don't want to take offense with you, but I think that that's selling it a bit short."
2011.10-948,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2741.043,2742.277,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-948,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2745.262,2752.768,"Actually, Mr. McConnell, can we go to the issue of class action?"
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2771.496,2782.685,"Actually, Justice Sotomayor, I think this statute specifically does not require -- it contemplates but does not require our -- class actions."
2011.10-948,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2815.256,2818.291,So your answer to me is that is waiverable.
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2821.493,2825.714,"Actually, my answer to you is that it's not a right to begin with--"
2011.10-948,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2825.714,2827.464,You have to meet--
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2827.464,2829.099,--Whether waiverable or not.
2011.10-948,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2829.099,2835.669,--But -- you have to meet the prerequisites of a class action before you are entitled to seek one.
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2838.938,2863.172,"May I -- if we were to hypothesize that the statute did provide that there shall be class provisions, which this does not -- I think this statute is agnostic on that, but the hypothetical statute were class actions are contemplated, I would not argue that that is necessarily waiverable."
2011.10-948,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.229,2880.515,"But you -- but this arbitration agreement precludes class action, doesn't it?"
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2880.515,2881.767,"--Yes, it does."
2011.10-948,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2891.756,2907.951,"Unless -- unless we read the disclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that you are entitled to bring your action in court, with whatever protections, procedural and substantive protections that entails."
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2907.951,2922.46,"Yes, and that seems to me just a further reason not to interpret a disclosure provision with a layman's language as importing, you know, very specific legal notions."
2011.10-948,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2956.432,2971.625,Could you in an agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify what a court shall consider in awarding punitive damages?
2011.10-948,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,2971.625,2975.512,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
