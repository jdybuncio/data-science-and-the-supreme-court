2006.05-1345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,We'll hear argument next in United Haulers Association versus Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,9.356,12.641,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,89.808,105.318,"I guess in many thousands of municipalities throughout the United States it's fairly common to have a locally owned electricity distribution company, or an electrically... or a gas distribution company."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,153.248,159.702,--The first point of clarification on that is the question... the question is does strict scrutiny apply.
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,159.702,161.32,"No, I'm not interested in tests."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,167.058,167.724,Yes.
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,179.366,183.001,"Well, I used to teach the subject and I can't say you're wrong."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,235.217,241.47,"--Well, if the utility is... if the utility is privately owned--"
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,241.47,242.137,"No, no."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,269.705,273.757,"--Well, I think that the same logic would apply as in--"
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,273.757,274.775,"Yeah, I think it would."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,275.809,279.16,--And it would apply to all of the cases this Court has ever held.
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,290.284,297.605,"Well, the fact is there is a difference between public ownership and giving an exclusive franchise to a public company."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,310.698,317.102,"--Well, I think that the whole point of the Commerce Clause was to stop these kind of--"
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,317.102,318.619,Nationalized industries?
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,318.619,321.971,"--Well, to stop the idea that everything can be localized."
2006.05-1345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,321.971,324.34,"Well, but you don't even have to get into the theory."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,339.015,343.936,If they're only providing it for free and not barring you--
2006.05-1345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,343.936,344.653,Yes.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,344.653,356.811,"--from engaging in interstate commerce, in the event, for example, that you found there to be some additional benefit from engaging in an interstate transaction, I think we would have... the Commerce Clause would be implicated."
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.083,365.783,"Well, I don't understand."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,409.212,413.147,"Well, it's market participation if all they're doing is public collection and bringing it--"
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.147,414.064,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,422.853,428.239,--If you parrot the Flow Control ordinance I think it's exactly the same.
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.239,429.608,"Okay, so that's fair."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,432.727,434.393,Yes.
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.393,441.749,"So that they're not competing in the marketplace in any way, they're not getting any money from the people who are dumping garbage."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,445.535,449.653,"The impact on the interstate market is the same, and I think that--"
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.653,451.022,"Oh, it is indeed."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,451.022,452.389,--the Court's Commerce Clause--
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.389,456.341,"I didn't think you'd be willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates the Commerce Clause."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,456.341,458.293,--But I don't think I... let me be clear.
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.678,464.363,"Well, I'm not so sure."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,464.363,467.149,--This case is almost on all fours with Carbone.
2006.05-1345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.289,501.953,"But in the majority opinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read it, on almost every page it uses words like ""local operator"", ""local enterprise"", ""local proprietor"", ""local business"", doesn't speak, as the dissent did, about a municipal facility."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,513.943,516.312,"Well, two responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.863,543.379,I'm sorry.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,563.359,566.394,"Well, I don't think the Court affirmatively decided the issue."
2006.05-1345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.975,605.869,"But not... you know, you have a whole string of commercial products, but you have recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal function."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,632.587,635.489,"--Well, there were two questions embedded there."
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.712,680.985,"Well, there is still at least the obvious distinction, that one of the main purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent protectionism."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,706.985,712.956,I don't know whether the framers considered it but I do know--
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.956,713.756,"Well, it's about--"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,713.756,717.776,--protectionism wasn't the only thing that they were concerned about.
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.776,721.428,"--Well, is there something here that is not protection?"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,734.702,735.204,No.
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,757.668,774.779,"But it was also protectionism... I mean, I didn't agree with this at the time, but I mean there, it... you have to admit that there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to the town for a dollar."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,804.882,817.975,"But it would be equally protected, Your Honor, if the government owned the facility but said you keep all the tipping fees until it's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too."
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,820.191,824.045,"Well, that's... that's a third case but that's not the question we have here, is it?"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,824.045,838.389,"--Well, the case you have here is are you going to adopt a new formalistic particular distinction between public and private ownership, when in the past this Court has concluded that a lot of these other distinctions were unworkable."
2006.05-1345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,838.389,841.757,"Well, so, you say formalistic as if it's a bad thing."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,870.274,884.434,"Well, I just think you are going to be walking into so many line-drawing problems because if that example is one, are you going to require 100 percent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50?"
2006.05-1345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,912.417,928.962,"It is kind of formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you agreed that if the municipality did it through tax revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,928.962,931.045,"--Well, I'm glad you reminded me of that point."
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,964.45,987.081,"Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable... recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1019.367,1021.436,"Several answers to that, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1115.312,1127.62,"It sounds to me as though, if we accept your argument that, going back to Justice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility in the United States is going to fall."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1127.62,1132.672,Well... I'm not an expert on... on that industry.
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.672,1141.427,"No, but you know, you know that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have municipal utilities and seem to get natural gas."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1169.197,1170.313,I didn't hear the last part.
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1170.313,1172.982,No more municipal pipelines.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1172.982,1175.017,"Well, I think they can have the plant."
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1177.302,1179.168,"Well, they'd like to run them as--"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1179.168,1180.254,"--They'd like to have a monopoly, and--"
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1180.254,1188.174,"--an exclusive monopoly, and in that sense they won't, they won't be around anymore because the Commerce Clause will, will declare them unconstitutional."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1188.174,1191.193,"--Well, but that's excluding that... as I understand it--"
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.193,1196.514,You would say that they can do it so long as they charge less than out of State people--
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1196.514,1197.097,--Yes.
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.097,1200.399,--and therefore people buy their services because they're cheaper.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1214.559,1215.009,Absolutely.
2006.05-1345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.009,1217.594,So long as they don't prohibit anybody from out of State.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1217.594,1218.143,Yes.
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1218.143,1221.581,Then where does your argument about formalism go?
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1240.959,1241.476,Well--
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1241.476,1245.447,"--for purposes of the Commerce Clause, and therefore the distinction I suppose wouldn't count."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1245.447,1263.574,"--Well, I think what I was talking about, the public-private distinction, it is different in kind from saying there are certain kinds of conduct, some kinds of Government conduct that are permissible like a subsidy, for example, take your South-Central Timber versus Wunnicke case."
2006.05-1345,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1280.468,1290.642,"There's some, then I guess you are saying some formalistic distinctions, some distinctions that don't make any difference economically but are formalistically different are okay."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1290.642,1293.278,"--Well, I'm not sure that one is completely formalistic."
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1334.421,1345.978,"Well, I... is there a distinction between the question Justice Breyer put to you, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity company, and this case?"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1374.88,1375.282,Yes.
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.865,1378.117,"But you don't make that, that's not the argument you make."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1378.117,1379.083,"--Well, I would--"
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1379.083,1381.235,At least that's not the way you answered Justice Breyer.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1381.235,1382.735,"--I like your answer better, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.305,1388.705,Like it--
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1388.705,1391.941,"But, but then, but then Justice Breyer is going to say well, you--"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1391.941,1393.309,--He'd changed the hypo.
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1393.309,1401.815,"--that you, that you can bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a little bit--"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1401.815,1402.532,You can--
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.532,1404.349,--actually is greater than the sum of it.
2006.05-1345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.349,1410.755,"--I actually point out that California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize the rest of it."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1466.072,1468.257,"--I, I haven't seen a case either way."
2006.05-1345,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.079,1519.356,"What I guess we really don't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of horribles are cases in which the municipality was able to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it, in which case there's no burden on commerce, or were they accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as Justice Scalia pointed out."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1519.956,1521.642,--I think it's hypothetical.
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1521.642,1522.375,It's a quite different assumption.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1522.375,1525.677,I think his hypothetical assumed a ban.
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1532.514,1537.985,"Well, what is your authority for the proposition that we use strict scrutiny?"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1537.985,1544.488,"I draw it from the entire line of cases, from the local processing cases, the embargo cases, the local--"
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1544.488,1547.959,Can you give me one case of it being strict scrutiny?
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1547.959,1549.042,--For?
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1549.042,1554.363,"I mean, I just didn't realize that that phrase entered into our Commerce Clause jurisprudence."
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1555.846,1562.183,"Well, I was using it as a synonym for the ""virtually per se unconstitutional"" rule."
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1562.183,1566.754,"That is to say, if it discriminates?"
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1566.754,1570.473,"If it discriminates, or some of the earlier cases didn't use the term--"
2006.05-1345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1570.473,1572.325,But certainly on burden cases we don't require that.
2006.05-1345,0,23290,evan_mark_tager,,1572.325,1575.443,"--Well, not the burden that we talk about in the price context."
2006.05-1345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.854,1617.654,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1621.406,1624.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1638.533,1649.241,"All the local processing cases, would they have come other differently if those facilities... the milk processing plant, the shrimp processing plant, and so forth... had been publicly owned?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1649.241,1651.008,"I think, Your Honor, they would be different."
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1671.485,1683.293,"Well, it might be a good revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other than ours and we'll charge triple the price."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1683.293,1683.779,Your Honor.
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1683.779,1685.195,That's not a burden on interstate commerce?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1685.195,1686.295,That might be.
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.885,1696.553,Suppose the user fee were ten times what it is?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1696.553,1702.524,"--We can only charge something that's reasonably related to the cost of what, of the service that we provide."
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1702.524,1703.107,Why is that?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1703.107,1715.498,"In Evansville Airport, Your Honor, this Court held that... versus Delta Airlines... that a user fee is constitutionally limited; there has to be a relationship between the cost of a service and the amount that's charged."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.498,1716.45,So don't call it a user fee.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1718.816,1719.802,"Your Honor, if we--"
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.802,1721.602,Call it a tax ripoff.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1727.758,1732.21,"--In New York, Your Honor, you either have to call it a user fee or a tax or something else."
2006.05-1345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1732.21,1734.328,Call it a cable TV franchise fee.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1742.951,1747.22,"I don't know what cable franchises base their, base their amounts on."
2006.05-1345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.075,1766.549,"To get back to the public-private distinction, what is the answer to Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to... what if you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent privately owned company?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1770.935,1777.405,"Your Honor, I think that the... they would not be... it would not be unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause cases."
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1791.264,1794.366,But at the same... exactly that... that avoids the problem.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1817.499,1819.268,"Your Honor, I agree with you."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.562,1852.489,"You know, there's a general agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't apply when the government is engaged in a commercial activity."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1876.354,1877.704,I think it is a reasonable rule.
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.714,1894.732,"Well, I suppose any private entity can choose its market."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1894.732,1896.768,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.768,1899.386,I suppose any private entity can choose its market.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1932.655,1946.581,"Your Honor, I don't... I agree with you that we're providing a service here, and we do use the law to require that haulers and generators participate in the service that we... in the system that we've created."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.674,1977.636,"You could do that by requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each householder just as much trouble then there could be competition and you would have achieved your goal."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,1978.319,1979.202,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.129,2049.112,You could do that by law.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2053.583,2054.5,"--I think not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.5,2057.534,"You don't have to run the business in order to assure that, do you?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2057.534,2058.101,I think we do.
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.101,2059.237,Why?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2059.237,2067.657,Because we don't have the power as a local government in New York to talk to landfills in Ohio or Pennsylvania about how they should run their facilities.
2006.05-1345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2077.398,2082.518,"But none of that... in answer to my earlier question, I thought you said none of that really matters, right?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2091.273,2096.193,--I think why public ownership matters is that it's not discriminatory.
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.829,2100.897,So your answer is yes?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2100.897,2101.431,--Yes.
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.431,2103.182,It doesn't matter?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2104.848,2111.336,"Well, hamburgers, Your Honor, if the government was going to be the sole purveyor of hamburgers in a community, I think they'd have to have a very, very good reason."
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2115.656,2119.192,"Well, that's just a question of New York law, isn't it?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2119.192,2119.908,Of--
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.908,2121.894,"I don't know, I don't know what municipalities can do in New York."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2126.446,2127.479,"--I am not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2128.931,2130.181,"What are you referring to, then?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2130.181,2136.168,"--The concept, the concept that government might be, might find it necessary to get into the hamburger business."
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2137.151,2140.203,Then essentially it's just a political check on it.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2146.005,2147.173,--That's one reason.
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2147.707,2150.059,But there's no Commerce Clause reason?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2150.059,2151.592,--I think there's no Commerce Clause reason.
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2151.592,2152.177,Okay.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2152.177,2153.311,I think there's no Commerce Clause reason.
2006.05-1345,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.311,2157.263,"Mr. Cahill, you started to tell us three reasons why it was important that you regulate."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2159.215,2169.987,"The other two are, Your Honor, that we are fulfilling national objectives in trying to establish the system that reduces the amount of waste that we generate and recycles as much as possible."
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2183.459,2192.981,"Well, but it's basic Commerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in what happens to the product out of State."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2195.683,2196.817,"--Your Honor, I think--"
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.817,2201.837,You can't say we want... we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other States.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2205.205,2209.323,--We are not attempting to regulate what goes on in other States.
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2209.973,2213.275,But I thought that was just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your point two.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2213.275,2223.964,--We are attempting to protect our own citizens by reducing the liabilities that they may incur if that waste is shipped anywhere outside of the counties.
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.871,2239.173,Whether they want the protection or not?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2239.173,2240.008,--Well--
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.008,2247.329,And whether a private individual can come and offer them the same protection for less money or not?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2247.329,2248.262,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.262,2249.995,We're the government and we're here to help you?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2249.995,2252.081,Yes.
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2252.081,2254.649,But isn't that almost a fourth point?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2275.211,2275.913,Yes.
2006.05-1345,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2275.913,2290.486,"If the government tries to pursue these policies solely by private inducement, trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county, another State, what-not."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2324.059,2324.926,"Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2405.595,2408.03,Who mandated this plan?
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2409.665,2410.549,--The State of New York.
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.549,2415.736,But the State of New York can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2415.736,2417.369,"No, Your Honor, it cannot."
2006.05-1345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2417.369,2425.509,"If you say the Congress of the United States has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2426.544,2427.761,"That is not our position, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.637,2448.624,Let's take one of these classic discrimination cases involving milk.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2466.836,2469.288,That would not discriminate against interstate commerce.
2006.05-1345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.288,2469.804,That's right.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2482.029,2487.615,"No, I do think the Commerce Clause speaks to it, Your Honor, but I just... our position is it just doesn't require strict scrutiny."
2006.05-1345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.911,2513.5,"So then, the Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we would develop federal law about what's appropriate for municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate?"
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2519.754,2531.611,"--I don't know how you would do that either, Your Honor, but you would be led into that by accepting the petitioner's argument that public services and private sector services are comparable under the Commerce Clause."
2006.05-1345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2535.063,2542.002,"Well, if we accepted that argument, we would treat the public services just like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring private companies."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2545.621,2546.954,"--I think we are not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.108,2555.66,But the whole point is these are not unique.
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2567.551,2571.271,--I think the approach that Oneida-Herkimer has taken is in fact unique.
2006.05-1345,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.456,2611.562,"But the challenge here isn't gauging this business, the question is whether you can require everybody in the area to go through the one facility and pay a tipping fee."
2006.05-1345,1,35641,michael_j_cahill,,2611.562,2612.681,Yes.
2006.05-1345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2653.123,2655.275,"Thank you, Mr. Cahill."
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2659.727,2662.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1345,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.726,2712.228,Let me ask you a sort of simple question.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2725.104,2726.754,There may well be an interstate impact.
2006.05-1345,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2726.754,2728.639,Doesn't that have a burden on interstate commerce?
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2728.639,2732.591,"It may well, and that is something that is appropriately judged under the Pike standard."
2006.05-1345,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.591,2734.71,Isn't that exactly what we have here?
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2734.71,2741.447,"I think that you do have that here, and you should judge it under the Pike valency test, not under the near fatal scrutiny that's, that's--"
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2741.447,2743.816,But Pike doesn't apply to discrimination.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2745.851,2746.485,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2747.601,2749.737,It seems you are conflating the two.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2749.737,2751.57,"--Respectfully, I disagree, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.698,2778.22,"So long as the government enters the commercial market, it can, it can create Fortress California?"
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2778.22,2779.787,"--We're not asking for a rule that broad, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.986,2807.205,It always benefits the State of California.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2807.205,2807.638,--Well--
2006.05-1345,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.638,2815.577,"And you're saying so long as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great wealth in the State of California, it is okay."
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2815.577,2816.543,"--No, Your Honor--"
2006.05-1345,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.543,2822.464,I don't see the distinction as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2822.464,2829.737,"--If you were to have government action, for example, someone suggested could the government sell hamburgers."
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.974,2867.043,What would you do with Justice Alito's question?
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2873.48,2874.766,It's--
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2874.766,2875.416,--produced.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2875.416,2875.766,--Yes.
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2875.766,2879.468,Held discriminatory against interstate commerce.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2889.007,2896.894,If that rule imposed no disproportionate benefits on out of state--
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2896.894,2900.714,"No, but Justice Scalia says it always does because it benefits the locality."
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2900.714,2902.064,--It's different if it benefits--
2006.05-1345,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2902.064,2903.499,You have... by criminal laws--
2006.05-1345,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.499,2904.216,You... I'm sorry.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2918.526,2921.545,--This is very different from those kinds of export bans.
2006.05-1345,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.747,2924.73,This is an export ban.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2924.73,2929.901,The export bans that this Court has struck down either created local--
2006.05-1345,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.901,2930.967,Your case involves an expert ban.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2934.869,2940.256,"--It does, and it does, and to the extent that's what you are characterizing as an export ban, that's certainly correct."
2006.05-1345,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2962.084,2968.654,"Well, there is an allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue particular economic goals that the municipality has."
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2968.654,2970.34,"For a different basket of services, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3023.324,3030.978,"If only facilities on your side of the case that are traditional municipal services, but then this seems to be at the borderline."
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3047.071,3048.371,"--Two answers if I can, Your Honor."
2006.05-1345,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3116.331,3117.348,"Is that what it turns on, the motive?"
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3127.956,3134.543,"No, I think this Court has held the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate means that is used."
2006.05-1345,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.828,3216.114,There is no determinative element in the Pike test whatever.
2006.05-1345,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3219.131,3219.798,"Yes, Your Honor."
