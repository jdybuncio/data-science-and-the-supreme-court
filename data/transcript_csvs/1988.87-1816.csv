1988.87-1816,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We'll hear argument next in Number 87-1716, Paul Green v. The Bock Laundry."
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,71.576,75.112,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1816,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.581,235.801,"These rules are applicable in both criminal and civil proceedings, aren't they?"
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,235.801,239.253,Generally so.
1988.87-1816,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.253,243.805,"So when they say the defendant in these rules, they could mean the criminal defendant?"
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,243.805,246.924,"And I believe that is exactly what they did mean, the criminal defendant."
1988.87-1816,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.838,269.273,Why can't it?
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,281.913,293.555,"You can do that, but I believe that if you are going to change the literal meaning of the rule, you are then bound to go into the legislative history and other rules of statutory construction to see what Congress might really have intended."
1988.87-1816,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.555,295.257,What was the old common law rule?
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,299.559,301.577,"No, I don't believe it was that strict."
1988.87-1816,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.228,328.694,"Well, can you make that general a statement?"
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,334.798,336.834,It was one of the sources that the Judges looked to.
1988.87-1816,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.68,363.067,Do you take the position that Rule 403 is applicable?
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,363.067,365.284,I think that is the most sensible view.
1988.87-1816,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.744,389.302,"Would you say that Rule 403 applies even in a criminal case, where the prior felony is one of honesty?"
1988.87-1816,0,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,389.302,390.402,Honesty or dishonesty?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1446.739,1449.525,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1465.467,1468.836,"Mr. Caldwell, did you try this case below?"
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1468.836,1471.788,"Mr. Nealon and Mr. Swartz, who are sitting next to me, tried it."
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1471.788,1475.156,"This is a products liability case, isn't it?"
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1475.156,1475.873,It is.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1475.873,1479.377,Where the man's arm was literally torn off from his shoulder?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1479.377,1480.61,That is correct.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1480.61,1487.9,"Just as a matter of tactics, why were these prior felonies introduced?"
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1487.9,1493.452,"Justice Blackmun, there were two issues in this case."
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1493.887,1498.855,Was there a feeling that the accident didn't happen at all?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1498.855,1499.707,--No.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1499.707,1501.623,Did you want to make a liar out of him?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1501.623,1502.992,Yes.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1502.992,1504.475,In what respect?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1504.475,1507.111,There were two issues in the case.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1600.156,1603.275,Then why did you need the felony convictions?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1603.275,1610.095,Because of the element in the case of assumption of the risk and all of that evidence came in.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1621.736,1635.227,"Carried to an extreme, your theory would almost relegate a felony injured... a felon who is injured... almost prevent him from recovering, ever."
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1635.227,1638.531,"I don't think that that is so, Justice Blackmun."
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1662.646,1663.596,But we are not talking about a criminal defendant.
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1665.948,1666.781,--That is correct.
1988.87-1816,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1666.781,1669.3,There is a bit of a distinction between the two.
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1669.3,1688.881,"There... there is absolutely but the Conference Committee... and when this was considered by the Advisory Committee on the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate, they afforded the balancing test to the defendant because of the rationale that guilty of one crime, guilty of another."
1988.87-1816,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1688.881,1705.74,"Well, suppose... suppose in this case, that the chief designer for the company was named as a co-defendant, and he testified about the design of the machine."
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1717.381,1730.958,"The ruling would be that the felony or any crimen falsi under 609 is admissible, then he is not entitled to a balancing test."
1988.87-1816,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1730.958,1734.593,"And, and how do you justify that interpretation of the statute?"
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1734.593,1738.814,There are two philosophical arguments that can be made here.
1988.87-1816,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.997,1744.8,Do those... do those lead to a statutory argument at the end?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1744.8,1749.919,"--Yes, they do and I can state them briefly, Justice Kennedy."
1988.87-1816,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1809.993,1817.064,But... so the impeachment testimony would be admissible to impeach the defendant?
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1817.064,1827.269,"It's... it's... it can impeach a witness and throughout the scheme of these rules, a party is a witness."
1988.87-1816,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.269,1832.406,"I'm... I'm... I'm assuming that he is a defendant, and the defendant is not entitled to the balancing test?"
1988.87-1816,1,42507,thomas_d_caldwell_jr,,1832.406,1834.275,A defendant in a criminal case is not entitled--
1988.87-1816,2,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,2875.069,2877.152,I will be brief.
1988.87-1816,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.152,2881.223,"Mr. Melillo, before your brief, something has occurred to me while I have been listening to this."
1988.87-1816,2,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,2890.329,2892.781,"Yes, I do."
1988.87-1816,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.781,2903.819,"So Congress must have thought that at least in criminal cases, it does serve the truth finding function to impeach any witness who has a felony?"
1988.87-1816,2,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,2903.819,2904.236,Yes.
1988.87-1816,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2904.236,2913.444,"Why would Congress think that is an appropriate rule in criminal cases, except of course, where it harms the defendant; but not think that it is an appropriate rule in civil cases?"
1988.87-1816,2,32092,joseph_m_melillo,,2913.444,2914.177,For two reasons.
