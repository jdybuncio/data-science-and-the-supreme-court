1999.98-1299,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.339,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-1299, New York v. Michael Hill."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,50.898,55.251,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1299,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.814,89.702,"Now, you say...  you say expressly agree."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,97.421,102.972,"Well, it is proper for the defense attorney in these circumstances to make those decisions."
1999.98-1299,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.903,104.48,And...
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,104.48,107.264,by defense counsel is sufficient for the court to rely on.
1999.98-1299,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.573,143.755,"It's just a matter of...  as a matter of convenience for everyone, I wonder why the prosecutor didn't point out that it was beyond the 180 days."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,143.755,144.87,I don't know that either...
1999.98-1299,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.87,147.365,"I mean, it would certainly have avoided a lot of problems."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,150.525,153.513,"They...  they certainly can do that, and frankly, the courts can do that as well."
1999.98-1299,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.513,153.952,"Well, it should."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,153.952,157.584,"But I think the question here then is, is that an absolute requirement?"
1999.98-1299,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.584,165.757,"Probably not, but I just wonder about the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to the court."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,165.757,178.389,"Well, I think, on the other hand, Your Honor, you could also posit that in fact you would assume that all the parties are aware of the rights and aware of the time provisions and they don't need to expressly discuss those provisions at the time."
1999.98-1299,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.176,219.911,"You said it's no different from any statutory speedy trial, but as I understand, at least the Federal Speedy Trial Act is different in that you can't waive the time limits apart from the express provisions in...  in the statute for waiver."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,219.911,237.19,"The Federal Speedy Trial Act, unlike the IAD, does contain an express waiver provision, and it also has been interpreted, because of its legislative history which specifically indicates that the intent was that a defendant could not waive that, and therefore the Federal courts of appeals have held that that is not waivable by a defendant."
1999.98-1299,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,253.126,258.206,"So, you...  you started out to say it's just like the Speedy Trial Act, but it isn't."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,258.206,259.978,"Well, I apologize."
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,268.691,272.239,May I ask you a question about your position?
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,284.954,285.78,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,285.78,293.31,You do not contend that it was a...  that you could...  you could prevail by arguing that that...  this was just a necessary and reasonable continuance.
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,293.31,293.499,No.
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.499,295.273,Why not?
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,295.273,305.926,"It's our position that the necessary and reasonable continuance provisions, specifically in the statute...  that also includes a good cause standard, and it also has to be done in open court."
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.956,308.005,"Well, this was done in open court."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,308.005,309.019,But there was no...
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.019,316.328,"If two lawyers say to the judge, it's inconvenient to go to trial on such and such a day, we'd like a later date, why isn't that good cause for a trial judge?"
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,320.748,330.612,"Well, I believe because it was in the nature of the colloquy here and there was no discussion about the reasons why that was done, because there was no need for the...  any discussion."
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,338.348,341.841,The mere fact that the judge and both lawyers think the case ought to be put over is not good cause.
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,342.584,343.493,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1999.98-1299,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.493,353.896,"The mere fact that the trial judge and counsel on both sides think a later date is...  would be...  would be better...  would justify a continuance, that would not be good cause in your view."
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,353.896,361.038,"I think if there's some articulation as to what the reason was, other than just indicating, as you typically do in trial practice, when the parties get together and a date is selected."
1999.98-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.812,373.436,That's the point.
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,377.507,387.249,It's our position that that provision of the IAD really applies for when the government is seeking a continuance over the defendant's objection.
1999.98-1299,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.273,404.506,I thought the term continuance is...  is used when a date has already been set and you want to extend the date.
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,411.731,415.28,"I think under a very strict interpretation of that term, that's correct."
1999.98-1299,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.881,419.246,I'm talking normal English.
1999.98-1299,0,39947,robert_mastrocola,,423.454,425.766,"I wouldn't disagree with that, Your Honor, but I believe the courts..."
1999.98-1299,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.766,427.13,That's why you didn't argue it.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1005.61,1016.113,Thank you.
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.934,1076.67,"But if you say the prisoner is the only person who can invoke the right, why wouldn't it seem to follow naturally that he would be the only one who could waive the right?"
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1079.254,1092.052,"Well, he was present at the hearing, but this Court has indicated that the defendant personally need not give personal consent with respect to strategic and trial type decisions."
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.923,1100.968,"Well, it's normal tactics and all the rest."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1110.545,1120.099,"This Court has indicated that instances in which the defendant must give personal informed consent is...  is, by and large, limited to fundamental constitutional trial type rights."
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.099,1125.3,"Well, I understand that, but here you have a statute, which you just emphasized the point, that in order to invoke the right, his lawyer couldn't have invoked the right for him."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1125.777,1126.399,That's correct.
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.426,1147.742,"I understand that, but I'm just wondering, given the fact that this statute is different in that it says the prisoner has to do it himself."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1147.742,1148.569,"Well, the..."
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.569,1150.548,"You'd just say, no, it isn't."
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.548,1153.77,Is it clear that it can't be done by counsel?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1155.172,1157.401,Counsel could fill out the form.
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.883,1166.112,"Well, but that's very crucial to...  to the whole line of questions that Justice Stevens was..."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1166.112,1166.401,Right.
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.623,1170.859,You think it would be ineffective if...
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1170.859,1171.602,No.
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.602,1173.543,if he made a request through counsel?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1173.543,1174.369,"No, it would be."
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.181,1184.855,I would think he could do it through counsel.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1184.855,1186.629,"Right, he could."
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.989,1200.542,What if he didn't say that would be fine?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1211.938,1217.633,"If...  if the court solicited the party's input and there was no response, that that might be a waiver."
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.145,1236.003,I'm not sure what that means.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1245.868,1248.263,"That is generally in the...  in the Federal system, he would not be entitled to relief."
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.349,1263.761,"Well, does it have to be waiver rather than procedural default here?"
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1263.761,1266.362,This case is express consent and...
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.362,1267.088,I understand that.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1270.265,1271.752,It's waiver in this case.
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.752,1275.633,Is...  is waiver the only way to get around it?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1280.175,1280.751,Absolutely.
1999.98-1299,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1286.945,1287.438,Would that be a State law question?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1287.438,1287.521,Yes.
1999.98-1299,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1287.521,1288.347,This came up from New York State...
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1288.347,1289.09,Yes.
1999.98-1299,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1289.09,1289.34,not from the Federal court.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1298.172,1300.03,"Right, and that wouldn't be a question for this Court."
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.603,1316.748,I can't see it in the statute.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1332.723,1335.135,My understanding is no.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.182,1337.415,That's my...
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1337.415,1339.205,State has is under Article IV.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1344.695,1350.146,"So, Ohio would have an interest in getting the prisoner back, I take it."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1350.146,1351.465,Yes.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.664,1353.983,In the...  in the hypothetical instance.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1353.983,1358.403,"Right, but that interest doesn't suggest that the right is not waivable or still can't be waived."
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.753,1370.951,May I ask you a question about...
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.951,1372.687,"Well, but the...  if I could..."
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.687,1373.059,Go ahead.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.059,1380.079,But the point is then there might be an argument that it is not waivable by the defendant because then Ohio's interest are prejudiced.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1380.079,1384.948,"The...  well, I'm not sure I'm following you."
1999.98-1299,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.581,1397.662,Is that clear?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1405.11,1405.193,"Yes, they could work that out."
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.508,1422.903,May I ask you a question about the relationship to State law and Federal law here?
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1434.659,1437.121,If the State had...
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.121,1440.942,"And then my next question would be if the legislature could do it, why can't the court of appeals do it?"
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1440.942,1447.052,Because it's a Federal question and I don't think States can amend Federal law.
1999.98-1299,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.171,1458.115,You think it's a Federal question that would preempt any contrary New York...
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1458.115,1468.517,"Yes, on the scope of the waiver, States are...  only could have procedural rules, but I think the...  the question of waiver is one of Federal law in which there has to be a single, uniform interpretation."
1999.98-1299,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.517,1473.143,"Well, certainly the New York Court of Appeals treated it as a Federal question, didn't it?"
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1473.143,1473.309,Yes.
1999.98-1299,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.309,1478.799,It cited a bunch of other Federal cases involving IAD's to decide whether this had been waived or not.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1478.799,1479.187,Yes.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.768,1504.972,"I still think we've got an unanswered question in my...  what we're trying to explore is whether or not Ohio has an interest in not having this time period waived, just as arguably there is under the Speedy Trial Act."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1513.35,1513.722,Right.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.753,1526.148,"Well, but that's the whole reason for a time limit under the act."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1526.148,1527.718,"Well, there are State speedy trial acts."
1999.98-1299,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.982,1538.492,Justice Stevens...  I have to attribute it.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1548.606,1555.415,"Well, this agreement has been around since 1957 and I've never heard of States complaining about this problem."
1999.98-1299,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1563.96,1576.47,"When you're scheduled for a trial in the Supreme Court of Monroe County, I don't think the defendant could get away with simply saying, you know, I don't want...  I want to be tried 6 months from now."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1583.157,1585.674,But our position is not the defendant has a right to a waiver.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1600.429,1604.621,"Well, of course, I think he would have a right to waive the IAD."
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1606.273,1608.419,The court can reject the waiver.
1999.98-1299,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.419,1610.665,He...  he may not have a right to delay trial indefinitely.
1999.98-1299,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1617.336,1619.11,Can I answer the question?
1999.98-1299,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.023,1626.791,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1629.02,1633.478,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.629,1692.55,Did the New York Court of Appeals rely on the interest of the sending State in its opinion?
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1692.55,1694.573,"The...  they did not expressly, Your Honor."
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.573,1702.004,"Well, do you think they did so in some other...  ordinarily one thinks of an opinion as being express."
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1702.004,1718.434,The...  I believe that the decision setting up a dichotomy between waiver occurring when there's a request by defense counsel for a continuance and all of the circumstances subject to the good cause test is a reflection of the public policy interest.
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.208,1726.69,"Well, I...  I asked you rather specifically not what the arguments were, but whether the New York Court of Appeals opinion relied on that."
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1726.69,1727.517,They did not rely on that.
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1728.093,1728.464,Okay.
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1728.464,1739.86,The sending State's interest in having their prisoners serve sentences in maximum security prisons in their State rather than local jails elsewhere is best evidenced by a number of things.
1999.98-1299,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.039,1788.983,"Is he held, as you said...  is he held in jail instead of in...  in a penitentiary while he's..."
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1788.983,1793.58,"While he's awaiting trial, he's in the local jail, which is a different set of circumstances."
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.881,1869.37,"One thing that makes me pause about your argument, Mr. Shiffrin, is that the drastic effect of...  of the result reached by the...  an indictment for murder against this person was simply dismissed."
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1869.37,1874.837,"This is very similar to speedy trial statutes in general, whether it's the Federal Speedy Trial Act, New York's, or Ohio's."
1999.98-1299,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.4,1888.772,Well...
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1888.772,1890.713,and monitoring of the time requirements.
1999.98-1299,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.29,1911.231,"Mr. Shiffrin, what...  what if the defendant and his lawyer both went in the courtroom when the trial date was being set and expressly said, both of them, to the court, we waive any right to be tried within the 180 days?"
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1917.546,1923.052,"The answer to your question depends upon the context of what was said before that, and let me explain what I mean by that."
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.052,1927.327,Can't...  can't you answer Justice O'Connor's hypothetical question and then explain?
1999.98-1299,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.327,1931.292,The trial court says a convenient date for trial is May 1.
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1941.239,1949.662,"It's my position...  and what was different I believe in the second time the question was asked is we found out what was said beforehand, which is the court has...  the court is proposing a delay."
1999.98-1299,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.575,1955.151,It's not a continuance.
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1970.383,1971.126,"No, it is not."
1999.98-1299,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.126,1971.492,No.
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1971.492,1976.2,"And the reason I say that is, first of all, I disagree with your predicate."
1999.98-1299,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1987.262,1990.522,"Well, if there's never been a trial date set, how could it be a continuance?"
1999.98-1299,2,18043,brian_shiffrin,,1990.522,1992.63,There might not have been a trial date set.
1999.98-1299,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.084,2010.973,"Well, that...  that may be New York practice."
1999.98-1299,3,39947,robert_mastrocola,,3183.595,3184.831,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.98-1299,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.246,3275.854,May I ask just one question?
1999.98-1299,3,39947,robert_mastrocola,,3302.314,3306.938,"Well, because what happens is the prisoner is always in another State when he activates these proceedings."
1999.98-1299,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.902,3337.57,I gather your answer is there isn't really a form such as I'm...
1999.98-1299,3,39947,robert_mastrocola,,3337.57,3338.723,"There's no form, no."
1999.98-1299,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.819,3347.534,"Yes, but if you had such a form and executed, we wouldn't have these problems anymore."
1999.98-1299,3,39947,robert_mastrocola,,3347.534,3357.177,"Well, you've got the distinction between when he's in prison and when he's starting the process and then what happens sometime later once he's been transferred to the other State and now he's into the process of the criminal prosecution in that State."
1999.98-1299,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3415.793,3417.651,"Who are the two States, just...  just out of curiosity."
1999.98-1299,3,39947,robert_mastrocola,,3417.651,3422.731,"Louisiana and Mississippi, and there may be something...  some joke there, but I don't want to say it at this point."
1999.98-1299,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.504,3428.053,"Thank you, Mr....  thank you, Mr. Mastrocola."
