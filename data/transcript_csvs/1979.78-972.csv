1979.78-972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.749,"We will hear arguments next in 78-972, United States against Apfelbaum."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,49.31,50.254,Thank you.
1979.78-972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.969,207.233,"Mr. Bryson, you are assuming, I take it, that perjury is prosecutable even after immunity --"
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,207.233,208.065,Absolutely.
1979.78-972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.065,214.433,"As a matter of -- if the matter were res nova, what would be the basis for that assumption?"
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,214.433,221.075,"Well, there are basically two ways to approach the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.945,324.191,"But if you take the language from Kastigar and from Portash, that the grant of immunity must be just as broad as the privilege against self-incrimination, it seems to me there is not a very -- that is not very logical, if the matter were res nova, because if a man had claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, the Government never would have been able to ask him any questions, and there never would have been any possibility of perjury."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,324.191,343.165,"Well, except, Your Honor, that if he had invoked his privilege -- let's take an example Suppose that an individual had committed a bank robbery, or was under investigation for a bank robbery that had occurred 10 years ago, and the statute of limitations had run."
1979.78-972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.465,394.333,"But that assumes that the Government isn't willing to force the Fifth Amendment issue right at the time; that rather than tell the man, ""We don't think you have a Fifth Amendment privilege."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,409.804,420.679,"That is true, but the question is, what is the scope of the immunity that he is granted, whether or not the Government contests the scope or the propriety of the claim of the immunity at the time it is granted."
1979.78-972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.698,456.705,Do I understand the center of your argument is that the immunity can not give him protection for a crime not yet committed?
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,456.705,458.194,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,535.384,542.423,"Mr. Bryson, I want to be sure, you outlined two prongs to your argument a little while ago."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,546.458,558.319,"We think, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that the theoretical basis for both really is found in the second prong, but I think we can rely on both --"
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,558.319,561.935,There certainly is Court of Appeals authority based on the first prong.
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,561.935,562.783,That is correct.
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.802,566.915,"You cite the cases, but you don't rely on the theory, as I read your brief."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,566.915,569.689,"We don't specifically rely on that theory, Your Honor --"
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,569.689,570.269,Why not?
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,570.269,608.448,"-- because, well, because we think that the reason that perjury is really -- the reason that perjury is an offense as to -- future perjury is an offense as to which there is no privilege, is because it is a future offense, not so much because it is perjury, although we do rely on the general notion -- which I think is an important notion, and it is one that has been recognized by this Court before -- that the grant of immunity has no value if in fact it confers with it an immunity from prosecution for perjury which is committed in the course of that immunized testimony."
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,608.448,624.123,"Let me ask this one Suppose, during the Grand Jury testimony after the grant of immunity, the witness truthfully stated that he had committed perjury on a prior occasion."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,629.765,646.908,"If he were granted immunity, that is correct, he would have protection against the use of his statements because he had -- he is testifying with respect to a former crime, just as if he was testifying with respect to a former bank robbery."
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,658.576,663.169,"So that you are really relying on that one prong, and not on the other one."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,663.169,680.018,"Well, we are relying on that as a theoretical basis, but I don't want to abandon the very important notion which underlies the first prong, which is that the Government must be entitled in granting immunity, to protection against perjury in the course of that immunity."
1979.78-972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.018,688.388,"But the scenario which you outlined a minute ago, seems to me to be the reverse of what usually happens."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,736.001,762.089,"Well, ordinarily it is pretty clear what the basis for the claim of privilege is; if the witness is being called in to testify with respect to an investigation of a bank robbery, and he takes the Fifth, it is pretty clear that he fears incrimination with respect to the bank robbery and possibly other related offenses, or related instances that could lead to his incrimination."
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.938,801.065,"Mr. Bryson, suppose on the first day of the Grand Jury he answers a question a certain way, and then the Government cross examines him, and the next day you show him some document and he finally says -- well, he answers the same question another way, and he says, ""I have just lied yesterday."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,809.708,810.734,"That is correct, unless he --"
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.734,813.256,And that isn't any different than what you are saying now.
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,813.256,819.417,"That is correct, and unless he had invoked -- having made his initial false statement --"
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.417,819.627,Yes.
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,819.627,820.814,-- unless he invoked his privilege --
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.814,821.738,But he didn't?
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,821.738,822.07,No.
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.371,824.808,But your immunity wouldn't cover that --
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,824.808,837.767,"That is correct, because the false statement, the perjury there, would have occurred after the initial grant of immunity, and as of the time of the initial grant of immunity, that statement would not have been protected by the privilege."
1979.78-972,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.365,851.349,"Just, before you go on, maybe I am wasting even more time, but am I incorrect in my assumption, my understanding that this basic question isn't in issue in this case?"
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,852.858,854.044,Well --
1979.78-972,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.044,856.576,-- there can be a prosecution for perjury --
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,856.576,860.345,The question of whether there can be a prosecution for perjury is not in issue; the question is --
1979.78-972,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.345,860.964,That is what I thought.
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,860.964,861.518,-- how much.
1979.78-972,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.518,863.569,"Well, then don't let me waste any more of your time."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,863.569,865.317,"Well, that -- there is no question."
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,981.946,994.995,"Could we go back for just a moment to the two alternative bases for the Government's position, and is it your view that testimony about future crimes is simply not protected by the privilege against self-incrimination, as a constitutional matter?"
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,996.152,996.953,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,996.953,1003.245,"The Grand Jury calls the witness in and says, ""We want to ask you about this bank robbery that you are planning for next week"" --"
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1003.245,1003.751,That is correct.
1979.78-972,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1003.751,1005.763,"-- and he claimed a privilege, you would say he had no privilege."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1005.763,1007.111,Absolutely.
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.521,1195.26,"Mr. Bryson, the statute clearly goes beyond what was required by the Constitution under your future offense theory, because he could not be prosecuted for any future offense except perjury."
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1195.473,1208.542,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that the statute is not -- the three exceptions in the statute are not the only exceptions to the use of immunized testimony, but they are clearly-stated exceptions, so that those exceptions do --"
1979.78-972,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.542,1214.65,"Well, you mean to say the statute should be read to say it doesn't apply to these three exceptions, or to anything else the Constitution would tolerate?"
1979.78-972,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1214.65,1249.679,"It is our position, Your Honor, which we argued in the Dunn case last year -- that point is not necessary, of course, to resolve this case -- but in the Dunn case that was argued last year, we argued, and we have made the same argument, I think, in a footnote in our brief in this case, that the constitutional limits is what Congress had in mind; that Congress intended the immunity statute to be read to include anything that the Constitution would permit."
1979.78-972,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.235,1303.003,Mr. Slomsky?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1303.003,1307.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.35,1464.92,"Mr. Slomsky, how about my question to counsel."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1473.309,1473.821,If he --
1979.78-972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.821,1476.306,-- and the Government prosecuted him for perjury?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1476.306,1480.874,If the witness conceded that the testimony on the prior occasion was false --
1979.78-972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.874,1481.762,Yes?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1481.762,1484.548,-- there is now evidence of falsity in the record --
1979.78-972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.548,1485.046,Right.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1485.046,1486.168,-- the prior testimony is no longer truthful --
1979.78-972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.168,1487.223,Right.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1487.223,1489.377,"-- and that is the Dunn case, I would agree that --"
1979.78-972,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.377,1489.828,Right.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1494.816,1495.961,But there is now --
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1495.961,1508.952,"Besides the corpus delicti, the false testimony is on day one, but on day two he says something that -- and on this occasion, he says that that was false."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1515.607,1525.712,The distinction I am drawing is this that the immunized testimony you are using on day one is now concededly false immunized testimony --
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.712,1528.006,"Yes, but how do you prove that?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1528.006,1532.437,The Government will prove it with the second appearance of the witness before the Grand Jury.
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1532.437,1536.781,So you are using it by other testimony before the same Grand Jury?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1536.781,1545.703,"Assuming that the second testimony before the Grand Jury is truthful, but there is now an acknowledgement that the first testimony is false."
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.703,1549.211,"I know, but you are still using his acknowledgement before the Grand Jury."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1549.211,1550.999,"Well, I understand that."
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.359,1558.576,"Well, would you say that would be proper?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1558.576,1565.971,That the -- I would agree it is proper only because there is now in the record an acknowledgement of false immunized testimony.
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.971,1573.845,"Yes, but -- so you would say the Government could use his testimony on day two to prove that his testimony on day one was false?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1573.845,1577.749,"Well, my answer is, yes."
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.749,1580.533,At least if it is in form of an acknowledgement of falsity?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1580.533,1581.045,That is right.
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.667,1592.058,"That doesn't really lead to a very principled distinction, does it, once we get to the use of immunized testimony to prove perjury?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1592.058,1594.139,"Well, I agree with that."
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.579,1669.579,"But how do -- all of those lead to very ad hoc distinctions, don't they?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1695.753,1699.415,"Well, that is a distinct possibility."
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.606,1723.003,Let me go back to Justice White's question to you.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1747.63,1750.94,I would -- in other words --
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.94,1754.123,And then he is later prosecuted for perjury before the Grand Jury.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1754.123,1754.503,Is --
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.503,1757.038,Would you say the immunity protects him?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1757.038,1764.979,"Is Your Honor saying that apart from the two appearances before the Grand Jury, there is a sworn statement in which he is admitting that his testimony was false, on the outside?"
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.979,1779.155,"Not admitting it, it is just totally contrary, just totally contrary, showing that his testimony on day one was false by the piece of paper which the Government introduces on day two, which shows that it was false."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1779.155,1808.758,"My position is, under those circumstances, that the -- there could be -- that the truthful admissions made in the Grand Jury on one of the two occasions, that is, there being two apparent inconsistencies, could not be used against the witness for a prosecution for perjury, because in fact the Government would be using against him, truthful immunized testimony, and there would be nothing in the record other than the inconsistencies, to show the false statements."
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.758,1815.098,"Well, haven't we said in several opinions that a grant of immunity does not confer a privilege to lie?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1817.972,1822.462,"That is correct, and I have absolutely no problem with that concept."
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1857.152,1859.0,You have altered my hypothesis.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1866.761,1883.652,"Well, the Courts of Appeals have held that under the inconsistent declaration provision of 18 U.S.C. 1623, that a prosecution could not lie under that situation."
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.321,1959.423,"What case were you referring to, now?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1959.423,1969.868,"The Portash v. New Jersey, that the inconsistent, immunized testimony could not be used against Mr. Portash in that prosecution."
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.389,1973.931,That was not a perjury prosecution.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,1973.931,1975.94,It was not a perjury prosecution.
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.764,2023.377,What is the reason for that?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2023.377,2032.912,The reason is that the immunity grant must be coextensive with the Fifth Amendment privilege it displaces.
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.882,2050.378,"But for the grant of immunity, the Government never would have been able to ask the defendant any question, and there never would have been any possibility of perjury."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2050.378,2051.649,"Well, I agree with that."
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.556,2191.973,"Well, you wouldn't contend, I suppose, that if in the Grand Jury room he picked up a chair and hit the prosecutor over the head, that he was immune from prosecution for that act on the ground that but for the grant of immunity he wouldn't even have been there, would you?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2193.196,2205.883,"I wouldn't make that argument, but with respect to the Government's example of, in the Grand Jury, a threat against the President, isn't that a present crime being committed during the course of the immunized Grand Jury testimony?"
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2205.883,2210.462,"Well, isn't perjury before the Grand Jury a present crime committed before the Grand Jury?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2210.462,2232.991,"Well, that is the reason why the future -- the claim of the Government that future Grand Jury testimony -- that the immunity grant doesn't protect future crimes or future perjury, must fail, because the defendant is committing a present crime and the statute is permitting the prosecution for perjury."
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.26,2285.879,"Well, why not issue a rule that he doesn't have to take the oath?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2285.879,2289.963,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, my experience has been that --"
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.963,2298.123,"I am getting around to the fact that, why is he the only one that has -- is permitted to lie?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2298.123,2301.902,"Well, he is not being permitted to lie."
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.094,2315.594,"Well, if this Court says that he can't be prosecuted for perjury, then he is going to tell the truth?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2315.594,2316.492,"Well, I am not --"
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.492,2318.185,Then he is going to tell the truth?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2318.185,2323.769,I am not asking the Court to hold that Mr. Apfelbaum could not be prosecuted for perjury.
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.229,2362.03,And you could do it for any other witness?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2362.03,2362.91,Uh --
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.91,2366.067,You could do it for any other witness?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2366.067,2367.042,Assuming the --
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.042,2372.928,You could do it for any other witness; do you agree on that?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2372.928,2381.341,"Mr. Justice Marshall, when you say you can do it with any other witness, I must admit I am unclear in what respect Your Honor means that."
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.341,2386.687,"Well, you said that they used the truthful statements of his, and that is what you were complaining about."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2386.687,2387.537,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.537,2393.15,"Well, could they use the truthful statements of a witness that didn't have immunity?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2393.15,2393.994,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.44,2404.522,"And what is the difference, except the immunity?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2404.522,2406.256,That is the distinction --
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.256,2407.636,"That is the ""vast"" part --"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2407.636,2408.581,-- and I consider it to be --
1979.78-972,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.581,2409.821,"That is the ""vast"" part --"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2409.821,2412.548,-- a very vast distinction.
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.396,2496.407,"Mr. Slomsky, on that point on the wording of the exception, you indicated that you thought there was some significance to the word ""in"" being omitted, but I am not sure it really is omitted."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2508.43,2512.082,"Well, it didn't say, ""in a prosecution for perjury."""
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.594,2516.911,And that is an exception from the category in any criminal case.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2516.911,2517.714,"Well, I --"
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.714,2520.509,"The universe is all criminal cases, with one exception."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2520.509,2523.367,"Well, I would agree to that."
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.386,2559.591,But that wasn't --
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2559.591,2568.273,"It couldn't be used in the Portash case, in the Government's case in chief, and I am claiming was it can't be used in the Government's case in chief also."
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2568.273,2583.289,"Well, what about -- go back to my example, as I was mooting with you, testimony day one, testimony A, day two, testimony B, and they are flatly in conflict, and the second time he says, ""I lied the first time."""
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2590.794,2592.394,Testimony B --
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.394,2597.314,"On the second day, and it is flatly inconsistent with testimony A on the first day."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2597.314,2599.061,And the witness has conceded that that --
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.061,2607.753,"And he says -- he says -- and the prosecutor says, ""Well, didn't you testify just to the contrary yesterday."""
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2612.856,2616.616,"So in other words, he is conceding that the one on the first occasion is false?"
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2616.616,2617.007,Right.
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2622.783,2626.715,The -- only because --
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.715,2627.939,"Well, yes, you say --"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2627.939,2629.244,"My answer is ""yes,"" but only because --"
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.244,2629.569,"Well, then you do say --"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2629.569,2630.964,-- only because of that concession.
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.964,2633.676,-- then you do say that you may use some truthful testimony?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2633.676,2641.804,"If the Court has before it evidence of falsity on the prior occasion, then that can be used, but --"
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.804,2643.592,"Well, they -- you do."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2651.948,2664.71,"Well, Justice White, I take that position because I think it is the correct position, and because I know that it was the position taken in the Dunn case."
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.653,2674.844,"But you can use not only his admission, but his contrary answer?"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2674.844,2687.198,"Well, the contrary -- the admission -- the contrary answer would be the corpus delicti of the offense, but that is concededly false, and the Government has to prove it is false, and there is a concession of falsity there."
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.198,2691.508,"Well, but you could use his answer, his contrary answer on the second day, which was true --"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2691.508,2692.077,I am --
1979.78-972,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.077,2692.864,"""Were you there?"""
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2701.889,2709.082,"Again, that is a concession I am making, but that is a vastly different factual situation from the case here."
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.07,2728.997,"What if on the first day he said -- he was asked, ""Were you there?"""
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2741.869,2745.873,"I would answer that the answer is ""no""."
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.873,2746.9,Why not?
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2746.9,2751.505,Because there is no evidence or no concession from the witness of falsity.
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.629,2782.969,"But that is just a ""but for"" test which would exclude a perjury prosecution."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2782.969,2796.251,"Well, I -- it has been the holding of the Court of Appeals in the Dunn case, that there could be a perjury prosecution under that circumstance."
1979.78-972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2866.798,2875.062,"But then you are in a really ad hoc area, when you start arguing about, was it inconsistent or was it not inconsistent."
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2875.062,2875.336,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-972,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.336,2886.124,"That may not be an argument against you or your suggestion, but it is going to mean a very difficult development in perjured reports --"
1979.78-972,1,33095,joel_harvey_slomsky,,2886.124,2886.778,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-972,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.838,2997.841,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bryson?"
1979.78-972,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,2997.841,2999.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-972,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3003.941,3005.1,Apparently not.
