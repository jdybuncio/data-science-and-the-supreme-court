2012.11-697,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.039,"We'll hear argument next in Case 11-696 -- 697, Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,10.989,14.107,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,70.943,85.62,"But your reading -- your reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere, the copyright owner loses control of distribution everywhere."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,89.072,89.755,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.331,122.81,"No -- but -- so this notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal exhaustion principle."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,122.81,123.495,--International exhaustion.
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,123.978,142.224,"And we are told that no country has adopted that international exhaustion regime, that most countries adhere to the national exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,169.541,171.791,"Your Honor, I have a few answers to that."
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.163,240.637,"Well, let's take, for example, the European Union, the position in -- in those countries."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,253.778,258.265,"No, Your Honor, not to quibble; they don't follow national exhaustion."
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.451,271.407,"Yes, but not -- not exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's home free all over the world."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,271.407,274.374,"--Agreed, Your Honor, but it is regional, it's not national."
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.205,307.346,"Do you mean by “ lawfully made under this title ”, simply lawfully made in a manner that does not violate United States copyright law?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,307.346,308.532,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.637,318.287,"The standards, okay."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,334.747,334.932,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.901,356.262,So -- so at least they are correct in contending that what you are arguing for is -- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the United States copyright law had applied where it was made; is that what you are saying?
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,356.262,356.878,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.645,357.962,No?
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,357.962,364.618,--that that statute that you just described would only do a third of the job of the first-sale doctrine.
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.032,386.215,I don't -- I don't follow that.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,386.215,390.65,--So the first-sale doctrine applies to goods made in the United States--
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.65,391.019,Right.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,391.019,393.97,"--and to goods made outside of the United States, is our argument."
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.97,394.603,Okay.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,394.603,411.48,"If it applies in the United States, if we're talking about goods made in the United States, the counterfactual “ if this title had applied ” would not work, because this title does apply to the goods made in the United States, and that's the core of the first-sale doctrine."
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,411.48,422.888,"So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that this language means nonpiratical copies as that is defined by U.S. copyright law?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,422.888,433.513,"Yes, Your Honor, if I may just change one word, because “ piratical ” is a mischievous word."
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,442.534,442.918,No.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,442.918,443.418,Yes.
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,443.884,445.936,I said as defined by U.S. copyright law.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,445.936,446.303,--Absolutely.
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,447.438,449.188,"So that's, that's what the statute means."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,459.663,460.13,--Counterfeit.
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,460.13,468.269,"--and other copies, and saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S. copyright law?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,468.269,469.169,That is right.
2012.11-697,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,599.236,607.157,"Mr. Rosenkranz, can I ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think it has theoretical impact."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,661.291,662.241,Yes.
2012.11-697,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,662.241,666.928,--I think clearly to the manufacturer who manufactures abroad--
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,666.928,667.961,Yes.
2012.11-697,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.961,675.531,--clearly to the manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,691.992,692.709,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,711.488,713.906,That is -- that is broader than I thought.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,719.977,720.444,--If--
2012.11-697,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,720.444,736.021,"--the manufacturer who is manufacturing under the English copyright, because the distributor has an English copyright, is not manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are manufacturing under the English copyright."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,736.021,736.305,--Right.
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.336,804.183,"But you don't have to say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured directly and received an American copyright and satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the conditions of the American statute, even though, for technical reasons, it didn't apply."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,804.183,804.683,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.816,807.016,"That's what your argument is, I take it."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,807.016,807.501,--Yes.
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.801,810.087,So we are off on a kind of curly cue here.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,810.087,810.453,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.609,842.189,"I took it that the reason they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage of the First Sale Doctrine."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,842.189,842.808,"--Well, Your--"
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,842.808,843.791,He's in the middle of printing it.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,849.545,850.062,--Correct.
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.062,852.412,"Am I right; or, if I am wrong, why did they change it?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,852.412,854.364,"Your Honor, that is exactly right."
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.216,876.093,"Did they give all rights -- wasn't there also the question of allowing manufacturers to segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad, governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States governed by U.S. law?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,880.914,895.274,"--So, Justice Ginsburg, my answer to Justice Breyer was about why the language in 109 was changed, that is, from obtained possession to lawfully made."
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.587,917.77,I couldn't find a word.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,927.695,928.312,No.
2012.11-697,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,928.312,930.93,"--No, but you just said yes in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,935.382,941.286,"Your Honor, I was answering yes to was this a motivation of the publishers."
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,942.838,945.607,"But a motivation for 109, or a motivation for 602?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,945.607,947.24,--A motivation for 602.
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,957.331,962.735,"So on 602, you said that one of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of markets."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,986.784,988.534,"--Well, it makes perfect sense, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1101.872,1110.227,"Mr. Rosenkranz, there is that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's fair to say, unfortunate to your position."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1116.298,1121.702,"To put it bluntly, yes."
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1174.904,1176.522,"Well, in result, but not in reasoning."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1183.51,1185.878,"And I have an -- I agree with you, Your Honor."
2012.11-697,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1323.266,1325.252,Has that ever happened?
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1333.724,1336.36,"Your Honor, I'm sure it has."
2012.11-697,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.953,1392.078,"Of -- of those -- of those courts that did hold the way your -- your opponent would -- would have it, am I correct that only one of them adopted the absolutist rule?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1392.078,1402.902,"Well, Your Honor, there are only three courts of appeals that have weighed in, but yes, the Second Circuit is the only one that has adopted the absolutist rule, and that's yet another problem with Wiley's position."
2012.11-697,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.518,1438.392,The government argues in effect for -- what we might call it -- a common law adaptation of Bobbs-Merrill.
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1438.392,1443.712,"Yes, Your Honor, which -- which is even -- creates even more mischief."
2012.11-697,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1488.341,1492.11,"Mr. Rosenkranz, can I take you back to Justice Ginsburg's opening question?"
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1537.674,1549.065,"--Well -- so first, Your Honor, back in 1976, this notion of geographic division was very, very new, so it's not at all clear what Congress was thinking with that -- with respect to that."
2012.11-697,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.228,1570.628,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-697,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1570.628,1573.78,"Thank you, Your Honors."
2012.11-697,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.78,1577.482,Mr. Olson.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1577.482,1580.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-697,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1691.505,1694.873,"Well, it may be important dictum, but do you really want to argue it wasn't dictum?"
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1694.873,1695.407,I do.
2012.11-697,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1695.407,1696.525,It was the holding of the case?
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1696.525,1701.027,"It was the holding of the case in the sense that it was necessary, the Court felt."
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1715.371,1715.754,You don't need that.
2012.11-697,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1715.754,1716.723,"It wasn't necessary, was it?"
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1716.723,1719.675,Your -- 602(a) has plenty of meaning.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1731.898,1732.548,That's--
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1732.548,1734.6,"Now, the only -- so there's plenty of meaning there."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1748.258,1755.514,"--Well, we're -- well, if we're reading the provisions of the statute, is that copy -- now, there are exceptions for the books that are brought in--"
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.514,1759.816,"No, no exception I take it once I bring back five copies and I give one to my son."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1759.816,1762.334,"--Well, there are fair use exceptions and there's--"
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.334,1762.718,"Oh, fair use."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1762.718,1767.321,--other exceptions and -- and there are exceptions for the one that you bring back for your wife and your--
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1767.321,1767.771,I'm sorry.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1788.652,1789.169,--It says--
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1789.169,1794.406,I'm -- I'm a person who's bought the book in England and I'm bringing it to my wife?
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1796.175,1800.793,--The provisions in the statute that deal with the libraries talk about bringing -- importing books for lending--
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.793,1801.777,So deal with the wife.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1801.777,1802.828,--for lending purposes.
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1802.828,1803.561,How does the wife get her book?
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1803.561,1804.78,What I'm -- what I'm--
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1804.78,1805.513,"No, no."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1809.898,1817.838,"--With respect to the copy brought in, in the suitcase for -- to give to a -- a family member or to turn over to someone else?"
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1817.838,1818.788,"No, to keep for yourself."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1820.54,1821.34,"Oh, to keep for yourself--"
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1821.34,1823.658,"--your reading, I brought it abroad, I can't import it in."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1823.658,1830.412,--What -- I believe that that is covered by the various provisions of the copyright statute.
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.546,1858.665,The reason -- what I was trying to bring up and I didn't do it artfully--
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1858.665,1859.315,"Well, and this--"
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.315,1861.815,"--is, imagine Toyota, all right?"
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1902.425,1903.108,--There may be--
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.108,1903.892,Is that right?
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1903.892,1904.958,--There may be just--
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.958,1906.11,Am I right or am I wrong?
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1908.646,1911.681,"--There are other defenses, but that is not this case."
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1913.081,1914.466,"Well, how do you distinguish?"

2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.591,1973.018,"Now, explain to me, because they're horribles if I summarize them, millions and millions of dollars' worth of items with copyrighted indications of some kind in them that we import every year; libraries with three hundred million books bought from foreign publishers that they might sell, resale, or use; museums that buy Picassos that now, under our last case, receive American protection as soon as that Picasso comes to the United States, and they can't display it without getting permission from the five heirs who are disputing ownership of the Picasso copyrights."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1987.928,2000.42,"Well, I'm -- first of all, I would say that when we talk about all the horribles that might apply in cases other than this -- museums, used Toyotas, books and luggage, and that sort of thing -- we're not talking about this case."

2012.11-697,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2009.375,2012.46,But you have to look at those hypotheticals in order to decide this case.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2012.46,2013.495,"--Well, and that's--"

2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2025.637,2027.103,"--And -- exactly, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-697,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2048.65,2068.214,"--Why is it that a U.S. copyright owner who contracts in England to make books -- he doesn't have an English copyright, he just simply chooses that place to manufacture as opposed to the U.S. -- why is he making that copy under English law and not under his rights of U.S. copyright?"
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2068.214,2081.474,"--Well, if he is doing -- if he is manufacturing the book in England, he's not -- because the copyright law does not have extraterritorial application, he is not making those copies under this title."

2012.11-697,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2230.17,2230.553,--Please.

2012.11-697,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2357.633,2360.502,--you are saying made must be manufactured.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2366.406,2373.076,--I think under this title means that it was made pursuant to the provisions of the copyright law.

2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2393.556,2394.106,Because the--
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.106,2396.258,The main point is that horribles haven't occurred.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2396.775,2397.908,--The main -- main--
2012.11-697,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.908,2401.496,Sometimes horribles don't occur because no one can believe it.
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2456.146,2461.365,"--Well, each one of those situations that you posit, Justice Breyer, has a whole panoply of set of facts."
2012.11-697,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2493.786,2497.89,"Counsel, you said there are other defenses, including fair use."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2502.925,2503.375,--No.
2012.11-697,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2505.06,2515.083,"Well, which ones are -- I mean, I'm -- it seems unlikely to me that, if your position is right, that a court would say, it's a fair use to resell the Toyota, it's a fair use to display the Picasso."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2515.083,2516.785,--It may be a fair use.
2012.11-697,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2546.521,2547.871,"Well, intending where?"
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2571.17,2571.855,"--Well, no."
2012.11-697,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2581.477,2592.518,"But you know, section 109 is just a rewording of a prior provision that you would clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing to do with where any product was manufactured."
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2612.58,2619.919,But the two pro -- what I'm -- I guess what I'm trying to explain is that the two were enacted at the same time.
2012.11-697,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.102,2760.16,"Mr. Olson, do you have an answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that if you read the statute as you are urging, then you are inviting the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs?"
2012.11-697,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2760.16,2762.195,There are several answers to that.
2012.11-697,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.862,2791.381,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2810.343,2812.545,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-697,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.602,2825.118,"Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a preliminary question."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2847.134,2851.253,"I think there are two related reasons, and one of them is the dictum, but I'll get to that second."
2012.11-697,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2882.807,2885.759,Could you point to something in the legislative history to support that?
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2885.759,2900.019,"--I think the best thing I could point to is a report of the Registrar of Copyrights that was issued in 1965, in which the Copyright Office identified as one of the circumstances that would be covered by the importation ban, the situation in which, quote,"
2012.11-697,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2918.98,2934.84,"So Mr. Stewart, if I understand your argument, both here and in Quality King you want the copyright holder to have some control over importation, but at the same time you don't want the copyright holder to have control over all downstream sales."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2934.84,2935.557,--That's correct.
2012.11-697,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2935.557,2939.275,And that's what your Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do.
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2940.693,2941.393,That's correct.
2012.11-697,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2941.393,2957.188,"Coming back to Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that truly the way to do those two things, to give the copyright holder control over importation but not over downstream sales, that our problem really is, do you think in your heart of hearts that we got it wrong in Quality King?"
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2957.188,2964.592,"Well, we lost that case 9-0, and so I am not arguing too vociferously that the Court should change its opinion."
2012.11-697,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2989.993,2990.226,So you get what you wanted anyway.
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3000.182,3005.467,"--Well, we're not urging the Court to take that course, but yes, that would have been one way to accomplish the same objective."
2012.11-697,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3005.834,3023.361,"So you are essentially saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the copyright holder control over the importation, to give Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr. Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3023.361,3034.903,"--I think that's correct, but I think our Bobbs-Merrill argument does provide a very principled way to stop it there without going back on what the Court said in Quality King."
2012.11-697,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3059.47,3078.515,"But you're saying Bobbs-Merrill means something beyond section 109, but when -- the 1909 Copyright Act said that it was codifying the holding in Bobbs-Merrill, and the 1976 statute which is now before us said it wasn't changing the meaning of the earlier law."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3088.038,3103.832,"Maybe I can put it this way: If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was illegally made without the consent of the copyright owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I can't rely on 109(a) because the copy was not lawfully made under this title."
2012.11-697,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3203.596,3210.269,That's an awfully difficult maze for somebody to -- to get through.
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3223.592,3226.611,But I think that would be true under anybody's reading.
2012.11-697,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3244.49,3247.292,"Well, it's not that complicated under the Petitioner's approach."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3249.31,3254.713,--The other point I would make about the Petitioner's approach is that it -- it really has no grounding in the statutory text.
2012.11-697,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3269.823,3271.925,"Well, the word has grounding."
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3315.519,3316.871,--I -- I give two answers for that.
2012.11-697,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3380.694,3397.24,"Which of the following is worse: All of the horribles that the Petitioner outlines to the extent they are realistic, or the frustration of market segmentation, to the extent that would occur, if Petitioner's position were accepted?"
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3397.24,3400.875,"Well, if they actually happened, then I think the -- the horribles would be worse."
2012.11-697,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3410.631,3421.288,"If the -- if that middle ground is -- were found to be not viable, which of the two sets of consequences is worse from the government's perspective, or can you not say?"
2012.11-697,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3421.288,3436.365,"--I would say that the consequence that all foreign-made goods, even if imported into the United States with the authorization of the U.S. copyright owner, are subject to continuing licensing requirements, etc."
2012.11-697,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.119,3443.304,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-697,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3446.589,3448.006,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-697,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3639.98,3641.563,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
