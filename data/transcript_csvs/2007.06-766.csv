2007.06-766,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-766, New York State Board of Elections v. Torres."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,9.106,33.137,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 10 years, New York relied on political party primaries to nominate general election candidates for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive, and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial candidates."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.026,102.413,"Just focus on, if you would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,122.409,127.461,"Well, in the first place, as you know, Justice Kennedy, that... that is not the case here."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.794,129.461,A hypothetical case.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,129.461,139.067,"--If it were an impossible burden to get on the ballot, I still don't think that First Amendment associational rights would be involved."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.067,141.019,"What about Kusper, the Kusper case?"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,141.019,145.506,"I don't think the Kusper case goes that far, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.374,163.55,"I think we have made it very clear that if you're going to use a primary system, you can't have such burdensome registration requirements that the primary system is not, to all intents and purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who wish to participate."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,163.55,179.494,"--I think that the other factor that is involved here is that, provided that there is reasonable access to the general election, which is another factor in this case, then the constitutional rights to associate are satisfied."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.494,189.433,"So you think that in Kusper, if... if there was reasonable access to a general election, you can structure and stifle the primary any way--"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,189.433,190.45,"Well, I think that--"
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.45,195.168,"--I'm just looking at the principle here, and it may be that you'll say that there's no burden here, et cetera."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,204.023,215.415,"--I think that the case that maybe best answers that is the Munro case, in which the State of Washington's practice... and there was a different practice of the State of Washington before this Court earlier this week."
2007.06-766,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,267.014,272.668,Is it right to regard the election of delegates here as a primary election?
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,284.374,286.125,"Well, I think there are two answers to that."
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.78,320.149,The State has not allowed it.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,321.315,324.267,"--Yes, the State requires it, but it--"
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.267,333.973,"Although if we... if we hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State merely to allow it, wouldn't it?"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,343.847,346.965,--That's the principle that the Respondents in the Second Circuit advance.
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.171,372.829,"Just to make it clear, is it your position that, with reference to this election for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on the ballot as a proposed delegate?"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,372.829,395.194,"--I think, Justice Kennedy, as long as the system in the State provides a reasonable access to candidates and political parties to the election process, that there is not a First Amendment right with respect to the primary process or the preliminary process, which in this case includes both the so-called delegate selection primary--"
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.194,401.514,"What if... what if it were the parties that objected to this and not some individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in the party?"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,407.852,423.028,"--It's clear the State has the right, and this Court has said so in the American Party of Texas v. White, that the State can require either a primary election or a convention."
2007.06-766,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,436.419,439.806,That convention... conventions can come in all sizes and shapes.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,481.883,503.646,"--Well, what this Court has said in the California Republican Party v. Jones case, a cite quoting the Eu case, the Eu case that the Court had decided before, is that the political party has the right to select its leadership, to select its nominating process, to select its candidates, and to exclude members."
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.068,516.953,"Well, the State can restrict that right if it wants to."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,521.258,524.643,By primary or... or by convention.
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.643,525.276,Or by convention.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,525.276,525.926,Right.
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.926,534.149,"But if the State wants to do it by smoke... if the party wants to do it by smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,534.149,542.505,"It can, Justice Scalia, but the State must respect the rights of the political parties in determining who their leaders and candidates must be."
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.505,543.505,"Well, but that... but that's not the issue here."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,545.957,546.507,Yes.
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.507,549.159,The State is not trying to coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't want to do.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,549.159,550.875,"Yes, I totally agree with you."
2007.06-766,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.088,595.918,"So the party is... you're identifying the party with the party leader because the argument comes down to this is not the rank and file that's making this election; this is the party leader; and the party might like that or the leadership might like that, but the rank and file might not, and the argument is that they have rights of association, too."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,595.918,605.458,"--Well, they have rights of association, but they have... they have associated in a political party which has elected leadership which makes decisions, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,622.152,633.71,"But if there is a State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to participation in that primary."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,637.595,638.611,I may be--
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.611,643.063,"--And then we can argue about whether the burden is too great here, which it may not be."
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,643.063,656.64,"--Let me say, Justice Kennedy, that I may be wrong in terms of what this Court's decisions stand for with respect to ultimately allowing, as far as associational rights are concerned, individuals and parties access to the total electorate."
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.938,816.377,"Have we... have we imposed any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State?"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,823.464,828.601,--Except in the context of analyzing what State requirements have been?
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.601,830.486,Yes.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,851.317,851.95,Aside--
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.95,856.371,--on the basis of some constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection Clause--
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,856.371,857.588,--Yes.
2007.06-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.338,859.406,--or the Thirteenth amendment.
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,859.406,873.23,"--The only cases that I would submit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would be Equal Protection Clause cases, because the... these... the political party is a group of people that decide to form together because of common beliefs."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,884.438,890.175,"Do you think a political party could say, you can't vote in our primary unless you've been a member of our party for 4 years?"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,890.175,892.377,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,895.329,900.864,This would be a State-mandated party primary for--
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,900.864,903.083,"--Well, a party might--"
2007.06-766,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.083,903.733,--election--
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,903.733,905.851,--A party would... there's two questions there.
2007.06-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.374,916.075,"Well, what about--"
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,916.075,926.514,"If the State imposed that, the party could say, well, that's unreasonable; we want to open... in fact, the Court decided this by saying that the... the party who wanted to could allow independents to vote."
2007.06-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.966,932.518,--Didn't Justice Kennedy asked if the Kusper case was correctly decided?
2007.06-766,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,932.518,951.582,"--Well, I'm not... I think I tried to answer that the best I could by saying that I think the import of the cases, without getting into the specifics of that, are that if you have a reasonable access by individuals or political parties to the electoral process, that satisfies the Constitution."
2007.06-766,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.582,952.899,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,974.579,983.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by responding to Justice Kennedy's question regarding the election of delegates and fairness for voters."
2007.06-766,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1092.337,1103.428,"In practice, how many people other than the slate selected by the party leaders run in New York for this delegate position?"
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1103.428,1112.118,"--In New York City, the evidence below was that approximately 12 to 13 percent of delegate slates are contested."
2007.06-766,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.303,1153.528,"The theory of this, I take it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention delegates, and those convention delegates choose the official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party."
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1156.33,1157.13,Correct.
2007.06-766,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1157.13,1168.887,"Well, what then of the fact that the convention delegates when they meet won't let people who would like the position of the judge appear before them?"
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1168.887,1172.608,"Well, that is not the general case in the State of New York."
2007.06-766,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.608,1173.508,It's not?
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1173.508,1184.682,"But even if it is, the important thing is not that individual candidates appear to politic before the delegates, it's that delegates have the freedom under the statute to vote for whatever candidate they like."
2007.06-766,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.17,1196.307,"Well then, how are the delegates to find out the qualifications?"
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1233.23,1243.103,"Let me respond to the most difficult part of your question first, which is the constitutionality of the party leader selecting a candidate we think is not troublesome at all."
2007.06-766,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1298.338,1307.111,I suppose that the State can make the judgment that it's more likely that the delegates would be informed about the qualifications of candidates for judgeship than voters?
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1307.111,1311.496,"In fact, we think that is the very judgment that the State has made here."
2007.06-766,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1445.232,1468.145,"But if the autonomy of the party and, let's say, the leader is the justification for this, the party... how... how autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you want to be more democratic about how you choose your candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this system on you?"
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1468.145,1473.466,"Well, the only system that New York is forcing is a bare framework for representative democracy."
2007.06-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.334,1476.851,"Well, the parties are not protesting in this case, are they?"
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1476.851,1478.12,--Absolutely not.
2007.06-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.12,1482.655,"If and when that situation arises, I suppose we can... we can decide it."
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1487.726,1489.109,We absolutely agree.
2007.06-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1497.847,1502.568,"In fact, it is probably likely the parties got this system adopted by the New York legislature."
2007.06-766,1,16786,andrew_j_rossman,,1502.568,1515.709,"--Well, however the legislative process has unfolded, in 1921, multiple times since, and to the present when the legislature filed an amicus brief with the Second Circuit, the legislature has clearly been in support of this."
2007.06-766,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.501,1581.451,"Thank you, Mr. Rossman."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1587.322,1612.457,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On a robust record, the district court, confirmed in great detail by the Second Circuit, found that there were severe burdens placed upon insurgents and placed upon party members who wished to band together to support a candidate."
2007.06-766,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.457,1618.11,What about the burden on a single delegate wanting to be on the ballot?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1625.064,1628.566,"Two... there was no specific finding that was a burden, you're correct."
2007.06-766,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1676.28,1687.838,"Assuming that the plaintiffs have associational rights at stake here, isn't this a case where there's a conflict between two associational... two sets of rights of association?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1699.579,1701.097,"--Well, the--"
2007.06-766,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1701.097,1702.997,Isn't that different from the cases that you rely on?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1702.997,1719.642,"--I... I think not, Your Honor, because I think if you think about the question of do the party leaders have the right to stifle the voices of ordinary members, one should conclude no, and it's very different from your decision in Jones."
2007.06-766,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1719.642,1722.594,But that's charged language: They have the right to stifle.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1722.594,1723.144,Okay.
2007.06-766,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1723.144,1729.165,"The insurgents, do they not... does not the right of association include the right not to associate?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1729.165,1741.405,"I think, Your Honor, the right of association does not include the right to use an election system imposed by the State which makes it impossible."
2007.06-766,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.697,1753.899,What are your... what are you best cases for that proposition?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1753.899,1760.469,In the... I would say in the first place I'd have to start out by saying there's not the case on all fours like this.
2007.06-766,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1846.288,1847.155,But Storer--
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1847.155,1847.938,Isn't that a general election case?
2007.06-766,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.938,1849.354,"That's a general election case, isn't it?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1849.354,1859.31,"Well, but the principles of whether the election, general election cases and the primary cases should apply, it seems to me are the same principles."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.662,1862.795,"Well, let me ask you about that."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1862.795,1863.828,Please.
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1863.828,1881.556,"Let's suppose the State doesn't think that direct voter election of judges is a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some insulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning and raising money and all that; yet, at the same time they want some participation by the voters in the process."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1890.764,1892.247,"There absolutely is, Your Honor."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.885,1902.822,"No, I'm just asking is there a way to have a convention with some role by the voters or the party--"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1902.822,1915.562,"Yes, Your Honor, as long as that convention does not set up severe barriers to people competing; and I would say even if you look at the Board of Elections' own--"
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.562,1925.652,"--Well, doesn't that seem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for voters, it can have a pure convention, that they're penalized if they have some role for voters?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1925.652,1928.854,"--I wouldn't put it as being penalized, Your Honor."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.072,1932.591,Being found unconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1933.408,1939.162,"--But it's what we seek and we think the courts below appropriately granted, Your Honor."
2007.06-766,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.706,1959.456,"Mr. Schwarz... I'm sorry, go ahead."
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1959.456,1979.285,"The, the problem that I have in the analogy you are drawing on the application of your principle based on the general election cases is this: There is concededly... and you mentioned this earlier... there is concededly no unreasonable barrier to somebody who wants to become a delegate."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2060.388,2060.955,Yeah.
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2117.324,2134.619,"But it's still the case that at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is that the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively politic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting selected; and I don't see that as a... as a direct ballot access claim."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2179.012,2186.032,--I think I would like to draw a distinction between the law as I think you've described it and a different law that Justice Scalia described.
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2225.526,2226.976,But the party isn't objecting.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2226.976,2228.644,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's--"
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2228.644,2230.094,The party... the party likes it.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2230.094,2231.863,--I'm sure the party likes it.
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2231.863,2238.834,"And you are the... the claim here: These people are not, as I understand it, bringing a case on behalf of rights of the party."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2263.918,2278.344,"Well, the... first, on the consent of the party leaders, which is really what we have here, of course they are... they like the system because the State system entrenches them."
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2279.594,2284.498,"Well, the Federal system in practice entrenches United States Senators."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2306.327,2310.446,"--Well, because the Federal system provides that there shall not be elections."
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2312.148,2312.681,Sure.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2317.719,2323.956,"--Well, I would still suggest, Your Honor, that, as we see the case that would be unconstitutional."
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2330.693,2331.76,Okay.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2372.187,2373.087,Yes.
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2382.459,2382.925,Sure.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2417.263,2420.149,"Well, Your Honor, let me try two things."
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2443.83,2447.782,And I don't know of any enemy of a United States... go ahead.
2007.06-766,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.782,2452.603,The person wouldn't be opposed if he approached the boss and the boss said: Yeah.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2461.792,2466.76,"But the... you know, this isn't an issue that divides by ideology."
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.716,2528.084,"May I ask you this question, Mr. Schwarz."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2542.461,2544.53,If it said delegates will be selected--
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.53,2546.413,By party officials.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2546.413,2547.897,--I'm not sure about that.
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.218,2561.741,"I'm just saying just eliminate this whole folderol about picking delegates and say the county chairman shall pick the delegates, period."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2564.943,2568.478,I'm not sure I have a position on that one way or the other.
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.084,2608.77,"Mr. Schwarz, you're talking about the election of the judge or the election of the delegate?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2612.09,2628.6,"--Well, the... I do believe that the election of the delegates raises the constitutional questions about has the State put its thumb on the scale, has the State done something that severely burdens the voters."
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.6,2633.253,It... the evidence shows the thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party chairman picked the delegates.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2642.192,2645.332,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2007.06-766,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2645.332,2646.985,"Well, if you're not sure, it's difficult...."
2007.06-766,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2646.985,2650.42,"If I could interrupt, Justice Breyer, for just a moment."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2665.491,2673.828,"Well, I think here it is the right not to be burdened, severely burdened, in an election."
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2676.18,2679.049,"No, but what you are calling... and correct me if I am wrong."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2711.569,2714.821,--We have never said that there's a right to win.
2007.06-766,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2719.023,2726.962,"Yes, but when you say ""meaningfully participate"" you talk about putting... and candidly talk about putting... a slate of delegates together."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2765.42,2765.836,No.
2007.06-766,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.5,2795.79,--Could a State decide it doesn't want candidates to have any part in this delegate-selection process?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2825.375,2854.394,"The problem is that in the real world the statutes work to entrench the power of the party leaders and to prevent voters from, to use the Board of Elections' reply brief, I think, on page 5, to use... or 17, to use... the voters are not able to band together to try and influence the results at the conventions."
2007.06-766,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.394,2855.078,Of course not.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2895.305,2911.398,"We... we have no problem with the convention, but we don't think that the... either the insurgent candidate or the band of voters who wish to support that person should be, by the State, fenced out, severely burdened from attempting to--"
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.398,2914.85,"But it's all right, I take it, if they don't prevail?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2915.5,2916.385,--Yes.
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2916.385,2924.908,--the other side says that your argument is... is implicated whenever a convention leads to a different nominee than the primary.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2924.908,2925.924,"No, that's... that's not--"
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.924,2933.764,You don't think there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that the nominee is going to be someone other than the person who would prevail in the primary election.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2933.764,2935.314,"--There is nothing wrong with that, Your Honor."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2935.314,2937.799,So it's all right to fence them out to that extent?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2937.799,2940.584,If you want... if we want to call that fencing.
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2950.706,2958.212,"I take it, in evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult it is for someone to be elected a delegate."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2958.212,2974.639,"--I think you should also look at the... since the party leaders run slates and they have no difficulty in running slates because... for various reasons that the courts found, I think you should look at the question of slates as well as individual delegates."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2990.266,2995.135,"Well, is that because Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members at the convention--"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2995.135,2997.004,"--No, he wasn't--"
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.004,2998.004,--for whatever higher office--
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,2998.004,2999.206,"--He wasn't trying to be a judge, Your Honor."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3010.514,3013.632,--What did he have to do to become on the ballot for delegate?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3013.632,3018.518,If he wanted to be a single person running... appearing as a gadfly--
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.518,3019.62,"500 signatures, right?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3019.62,3020.786,--He needs the 500 signatures.
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3020.786,3023.488,"If we don't think that's a sufficient burden, do you lose?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3023.488,3026.457,"I think we have a difficult case, if you don't think that's sufficient burden."
2007.06-766,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3027.14,3030.808,But the State... the trial court didn't find that that was a burden.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3030.808,3054.357,"--No, I... I'm not... I'm agreeing with the Chief Justice that I think that, if you thought that just running for one delegate slot was sufficient to solve the problem of a State statute that was designed... their words, their admission... to entrench the power of the party leaders, I think that gives us a problem."
2007.06-766,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.357,3055.126,Why?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3069.033,3072.152,The safety valve being?
2007.06-766,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.152,3076.706,The safety valve being that the party leaders cannot just choose anybody.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3084.728,3085.295,Well--
2007.06-766,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3085.295,3088.014,"So they have leeway, but you can't go too far."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3088.014,3099.155,"--The record, Your Honor, and this is an extensive record, shows that the party leaders can choose and do choose people who are, to use your word, who are--"
2007.06-766,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.155,3100.038,You don't like that.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3118.616,3130.274,"--We... no, we... we have not said that there needs to be a primary."
2007.06-766,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3135.209,3151.053,"That's the... that's the remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was... at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be chosen by primary."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3151.053,3160.86,"--Yes, the... but the judge, Your Honor... the judge did two things in imposing that remedy, three or four things actually: He said, first, I'm not going to micromanage."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3191.88,3197.033,Do you agree it's not realistic that one way they would address it is by having an entirely appointed system?
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3197.033,3199.318,"No, they... they're entitled to do that."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3199.318,3200.518,I know they are entitled to it.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3200.518,3201.518,"Well, the--"
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3201.518,3203.018,"As a practical matter, is that a realistic option in New York?"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3203.018,3222.063,"--If you look at the amicus briefs filed in our favor, the State bar, the City bar, the Fund for the Modern Courts, the City of New York all filed a brief in which they say, we think the right solution is to have an appointive system, and they're working to try to have that happen."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3228.252,3229.386,"Well, I'm sure he has."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3232.238,3232.904,"--No, not--"
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3232.904,3240.393,I thought I read a representation somewhere in the briefs that it's unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an entirely appointive system.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3249.415,3255.569,"--No, it could be a role for the voters that does not burden them in the way this statute burdens them."
2007.06-766,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3290.723,3302.883,"There's also one view, I think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst thing in the world would be to return us to the primary system this system was intended to replace."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3302.883,3316.107,"--Yes, the... actually the Feerick report, which found that the party leaders all over State however have always made the picks, they voiced a favoring amending the law."
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.325,3374.543,They're all policy arguments about why this is a terrible statute.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3377.329,3378.181,"--No, they also speak--"
2007.06-766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3378.181,3379.231,And that's a vast difference.
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3379.231,3393.106,"--speak about the Constitution, and, indeed, it's not very often that you find, on a constitutional issue, both the Washington Legal Foundation and the ACLU coming in, as they have come in, to assert that this is an unconstitutional statute."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3393.106,3396.308,"Well, it's not often you have both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party...--"
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3398.208,3418.872,"Yes, but then I... I think you should look at the... what you've said in... not you, but your predecessor said in Eu, about we've never held that a political party's consent will cure a statute that otherwise is violative and, there are other quotes in Justice Scalia's Tashjian opinion and in... in several other cases to that effect."
2007.06-766,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3418.872,3419.788,"Thank you, Mr. Schwarz."
2007.06-766,2,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,3419.788,3420.205,Thank you.
2007.06-766,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3422.997,3424.124,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-766,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3483.445,3485.147,"You say the State, your mean the State statute?"
2007.06-766,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3485.147,3485.764,--Yes.
2007.06-766,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3563.414,3565.649,You're not saying the State could compel that?
2007.06-766,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3565.649,3566.299,--No.
2007.06-766,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3566.968,3568.251,You're saying that the State could permit it?
2007.06-766,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3568.251,3569.051,No.
2007.06-766,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3689.447,3690.064,Thank you Mr. Olson.
