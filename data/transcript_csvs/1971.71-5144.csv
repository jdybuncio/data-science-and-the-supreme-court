1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.261,"We'll hear arguments next in number 71-5144, McNeil against Patuxent."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,64.536,67.171,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,166.825,177.522,"Do we have any way of knowing Mr. Prettyman whether some of that information the judge was acting on came out of the so called probation report, the pre-sentence report?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,177.522,179.578,We do not know.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,203.674,222.904,"Would you -- would it be reasonable to assume that had he cooperated with the psychiatric people at Patuxent, that this determination could have been made on the ordinary course?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,222.904,224.693,You mean after he reached Patuxent?
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.693,225.095,Right.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,225.095,230.015,"And then if he had cooperated, they could have discovered whether he was a defective delinquent."
1971.71-5144,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,241.413,245.519,Mr. Prettyman what -- didn't they examine him in Baltimore?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,245.519,246.649,"Yes, I was about to say."
1971.71-5144,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,273.326,277.271,Was that doctor Goodmarker is still there?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,277.271,282.385,"The -- unfortunately sir, the report itself is a not in the record."
1971.71-5144,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,290.752,292.928,I see.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,292.928,307.553,"He said that there was a possibility of a personality pattern disturbance, schizoid type and he recommended evaluation at Patuxent as a result."
1971.71-5144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.386,336.015,By the sentencing judge?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,336.015,337.775,"Yes sir, by the sentencing judge."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.812,466.957,"Mr. Prettyman, I am surprised that you would press the point that a psychiatric examination, useful dimensions can be made if the subject, the patient refuses to answer any questions."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,466.957,474.057,"In the McKenzie case, cited in our brief, Your Honor, the same position was taken in regard to Mr. McKenzie."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,493.582,495.965,"And this is his court hearing, Mr. Prettyman."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,495.965,498.074,"The hearing which -- yes, the Court hearing which would be proceed --"
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.074,500.509,After he goes back to the jury trial.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.509,508.14,"Your answer goes to the judicial response to this problem, not to the medical one that I was driving at."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,531.504,534.661,My answer is two-fold Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,560.398,561.242,In some cases?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,561.242,566.726,"In some cases, I do not for a moment claim that it can necessarily be done with him, I do not know."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,571.667,573.766,"Well, that clears the air, at least for me."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,573.766,577.312,"Without his cooperation, that is correct."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.952,628.652,I thought your position now was now that the time of the sentence has elapsed that he is entitled to his release.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,628.652,630.77,"No question about it, but we claim that he --"
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,630.77,635.053,Not that he has -- not to go back to the Court at this date.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,635.053,636.632,"Well, your quite right."
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,659.589,676.835,"What would the determination be Mr. Prettyman, that well, if he will not, I should say avail himself off, but he wouldn't submit to the procedures at Patuxent, then if that is the finding, send them to serve out his sentence at the state prison."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,676.835,685.028,"Yes, if they cannot find that he is a defective delinquent then he goes back to prison under the normal course and he serves out his sentence then he is free."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.028,686.477,What is the time?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,693.468,702.265,"I would think the system set up by the statute is a good one which was not followed here, namely they keep him for six months and then they are supposed to report back to the Court."
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.743,730.423,"Well, suppose I say we simply cannot determine one way or the other?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,730.423,731.618,Then the Court--
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,731.618,735.459,"Well, I am just wondering, what are the options open to the Court?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,737.842,744.247,"Well, Your Honor, I am not sure about that for this reason, that it is not Patuxent after all that makes the determination."
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.396,758.016,"Well, let me add to my -- suppose then the Court says, well, I am helpless to -- the judge said I do not know what we can do about it, then what disposition?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,758.016,760.024,Then he goes back to prison.
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.024,768.864,"Well, is the option open to the judge to say, well, I cannot now, but I won't send him to prison, I will let him serve out his sentence in the Patuxent?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,768.864,775.518,"Well, Your Honor I certainly do not think that he ought to be serving out his sentence in Patuxent if they cannot make a determination that he is in fact --"
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.518,775.58,I see.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,775.58,777.665,-- a defective delinquent any more than you could --
1971.71-5144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.665,784.614,"From the state standpoint, but from your state, is your client prejudiced at all by serving his term out at Patuxent?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,784.614,784.79,Oh!
1971.71-5144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.638,785.873,Why?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,785.873,791.403,"If he were at -- were he had been sentenced, he would have receiving therapy for six years."
1971.71-5144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.411,802.999,May be it if he had been stayed quite in there.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,802.999,803.708,Pardon me?
1971.71-5144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.708,808.235,Maybe not if he had remained quite there.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,808.235,812.227,You are assuming that they could him therapy without talking to him.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,812.227,817.718,He might well talk if he did not have to answer the kinds of questions that are going to be directed to him by Patuxent.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,827.98,830.128,"That is really on the speculation, the way --"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,830.128,832.727,"Well, I do not think so."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,941.593,946.705,"Well, that shows he is delinquent and then only other question is whether or not he is defective?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,946.705,949.929,"Well no, as a matter of fact, Your Honor, it goes to the entire definition."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.856,960.245,You might be a very effective delinquent?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,960.245,962.012,"[Attempted Laughter]That is very well put, Your Honor."
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,967.293,968.533,Your brief again?
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,968.533,971.673,"Yes, footnote 6 on page 6."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.943,985.595,And --
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,985.595,989.344,"Yes, but then the rest of it is not “or” it is “and,” you have to make both find to say."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.344,994.195,"That is right, (a) that he is a delinquent and (b) that he is defective."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,994.195,998.073,"Well, if it suits Your Honor, you divide it up that is fine, but I --"
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.073,1003.417,"It seems to me that the statute, it's not that you can't find either, but you have to find both."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1003.417,1009.024,Right and once you find both then he is a defective delinquent and then he gets an indeterminate sentence at Patuxent.
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1009.024,1020.234,"And if they show his delinquency through his own answers, after he decided or not, he is intellectually defective, has intellectual deficiency or emotional imbalance."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1020.234,1040.555,"Right, and that's the reason that they are going to answer these questions and Your Honor said he wouldn't engage in therapy, we do not know that all because therapy after all would not be trying to prove that he had been engaged in persistent criminal behavior, every time you get to the essence of the man to try help him so that he could when he got out of prison he will be a better man."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1048.086,1059.111,But you are assuming that the therapy would begin on a clean slate without knowing what his -- what diagnosis to make Mr. Prettyman.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1059.111,1062.24,Therapy at Hagerstown would begin regardless that is what the Attorney General --
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.24,1069.591,"Well, but isn't therapy -- doesn't therapy first call for a diagnosis."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1073.034,1089.473,"I do not know the procedure that is engaged in prison, but my understanding is that anybody in prison who either wants therapy or who the prison authorities would be helped by therapy is allowed to have therapy."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1110.438,1117.725,That goes to your point that after six months in any event he had to go back to the business.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1117.725,1119.356,Correct.
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1119.356,1140.642,"Would -- under the Maryland statute, would the Maryland Court judge having that hearing after the six months in Patuxent have the power and authority to say, well I think we will try this again so we are going to send you back for another 90 days or six months outside limit."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1140.642,1144.98,"Your Honor, I think it would depend a lot upon the circumstances of the individual file."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1171.63,1174.032,Does it violate the statute to do that.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1174.032,1184.864,"No because if so long as they report back within six months I think if the Court were to make a finding that they were entitled to look at him again, it could well be extended."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1184.864,1193.337,What if the judge just said here to this man that you have not cooperated.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1204.162,1227.877,"Well, if the judge were to find that he was refusing to cooperate on purely arbitrary grounds with no grounds at all and he were so to inform the man, so that the man would have a judicial finding that the grounds that he was asserting for refusing to cooperate were invalid and it might will be that in effect they would be giving him a second chance to cooperate and he might or might not."
1971.71-5144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.714,1263.114,"Well, the facts of this case do not require you to rest on any expression of a statutory period of time less than the period of it is confinement under the criminal sentence, do they?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1263.114,1277.669,"I would be taking the position here even if his criminal sentence had not expired that he was entitled to a judicial hearing when they refused to do anything with him except to say that he can be kept indefinitely, but I think this."
1971.71-5144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1372.03,1375.945,"Well, I am familiar with this whole statute of limitations for crimes like murder."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1378.8,1382.573,For any crime for which you can be sentenced to prison.
1971.71-5144,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1382.573,1391.1,"Mr. Prettyman, I think I understood you to say that you thought the system at Patuxent was essentially a good one."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1413.65,1416.935,"I would be a petitioner in Murel, probably Your Honor."
1971.71-5144,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1416.935,1418.892,In case we had here today --
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1418.892,1429.8,"I would be adapting probably many of the objections of the system that Mr. Murel and the other petitioners had, but this I want to emphasize is a very, very different case."
1971.71-5144,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1439.645,1455.063,"Your position if I understand it is that a sure way to avoid the system at Patuxent is not to cooperate with it, if your term is one year or three years or five years, when that expires you out of it automatically."
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1455.063,1463.689,"Not necessarily because as in the McKenzie case that may find you to be a defective delinquent anyway, if they have a proper record and can uphold that."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1514.623,1515.762,Very well Mr. Prettyman.
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1515.762,1524.917,"Just before you sit down, even though you won couldn't it be sort of a period that couldn't he be then civilly committed?"
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1524.917,1525.136,Oh!
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1527.172,1533.364,Let us then say that we decided that he is now entitled to his release then the very next day couldn't he be civilly committed.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1533.364,1537.161,"Well, under the civil commitments you have different standards than you do here."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.792,1539.164,It's not defective delinquency.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1539.164,1540.371,"No, it certainly isn't."
1971.71-5144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1547.89,1549.603,That he was not psychotic.
1971.71-5144,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1549.603,1554.629,"So, I do not think they could."
1971.71-5144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1554.629,1556.595,Mr. Lord?
1971.71-5144,1,27539,henry_r_lord,,1556.595,1564.07,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.71-5144,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.309,1691.124,You agree with Mr. Prettyman there is nothing in the record to show why the judge insisted on the psychiatric examination?
1971.71-5144,1,27539,henry_r_lord,,1691.124,1695.384,There is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Your Honor.
1971.71-5144,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3472.815,3478.691,"Please the Court, in view of the concessions made by the state let me just make one last point in regard to the remedy."
1971.71-5144,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.305,3548.639,"I take it you say that this information since it would be used in connects with deciding whether he is a defective delinquent which might result in extending his terms, is it so incriminating?"
1971.71-5144,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3548.639,3550.368,I say three things one.
1971.71-5144,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3605.765,3611.259,Mr. Prettyman you acted at the Court's request and by the Court's appointment of is difficult problem.
