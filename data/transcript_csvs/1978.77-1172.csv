1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.065,We’ll hear arguments first this afternoon in National Muffler Dealers against The United States.
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,10.378,15.3,Mr. Chief Justice and it may please the Court.
1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.201,123.325,"Would you say Mr. Gordon that, that would be little bit like the union being organized when a non-union plant changes hands with the new owner?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,123.325,142.765,"Exactly, its similar to that and we make the argument in our papers, that there is a great similarity between a union and in this case while not a union, nevertheless a group of business man, if you well getting together to bargain collectively with their franchisor."
1978.77-1172,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,200.718,207.66,"Mr. Gordon, I suppose it's irrelevant, but we have very much money involved here, tax violations and all."
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,207.66,240.539,"Well, there could be, there some money involved here and they could be significant amounts of money involved only because it's very frequently the case that a franchisee organization builds up a reserve to have as a kind of war chest, if you will, and during those times, that it builds up the reserve when its incomes exceeds the amounts of its outgo for any particular period of time for one year, two years, three years or at any time when it shows an excess of income over expenditures there is that much involved."
1978.77-1172,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,247.357,254.729,"I suppose, I should ask government counsel that question here because they have other cases presumably, but it didn't seem to me as --"
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,254.729,259.411,Non-profit organization with a $1 million war chest?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,259.411,264.855,"Well, we don’t have a $1 million war chest in this case and actually--"
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,264.855,265.993,But you could get one?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,265.993,280.593,"We could, but on the other hand I would say Your Honor, that if any association, any business league or trade association ever built up an unnecessary accumulation of surplus, the internal revenue service has plenty of tools."
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,280.593,283.23,When it refers -- had to drop toward non-profit?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,283.23,302.441,"That’s correct and non- profit means essentially that and is defined in the statute that no part of the income is goes to any individual association member, so that the amount of money I don’t think is an issue here."
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,302.441,305.938,Your clients get some dues and contributions from his members?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,305.938,313.392,"This is solely -- this association is solely financed by dues from its members, that’s correct."
1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,322.536,328.765,Would it make any difference to your case if they had $1 million or $2 million instead of whatever it is that they have?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,328.765,329.809,It might.
1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.151,333.257,"In this case, in this posture?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,333.257,334.286,Not in this case.
1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.286,335.852,That will be in some future case?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,335.852,355.836,"That’s correct, and some future case, if it is determined that there was on reasonable accumulation that perhaps it had lost its so called non-profit status because of the way it operated as I say, I’m sure the Internal Revenue Service has adequate means with which to check on that and change the ruling or look at it."
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,355.836,359.417,Non Profitable -- you have to file the returns?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,359.417,359.903,I beg your pardon sir.
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,359.903,362.782,Don't non-profit organizations have to file returns?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,362.782,363.781,"Yes, they do --"
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.781,365.005,So that’s easy way to check?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,365.005,365.357,That’s right.
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.831,384.742,"If you run this case, will you have to file any returns?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,384.742,386.1,We have been filing returns Your Honor.
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,386.1,388.457,Your exempt from taxation?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,388.457,393.085,We have filed returns as a non exempt from taxation claiming that there is --
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.085,394.763,"No, is exempt from taxation?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,394.763,404.275,"No, we’re filing -- claiming that we, since we have denied the exemption would be filing regular returns under protest and we have filed refunds in each case and that’s how we get here because --"
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.275,407.799,"Yes, but if you win this case, if you win this case --"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,407.799,408.969,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.969,410.684,-- will you continued to file returns?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,410.684,411.217,Certainly.
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.653,424.395,"Now, more than that as an organization it comes under this particular statute."
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,424.395,425.009,That’s correct.
1978.77-1172,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.009,426.95,Not just as any non-profit organization?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,426.95,433.264,"No, no as one under 501(c)(6), we are required to file annual income tax returns."
1978.77-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.264,438.909,"Well, there is no general statute or statutory exemption for a non-profit corporations?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,438.909,440.221,No sir there is not.
1978.77-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.221,448.153,And section one above 16 or 17 different sub/categories or groups that are exempted?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,448.153,473.502,"That is correct and this category is, if I may go to the statute now the business league, the statute which was passed in 1913 and I should say in passing that it's long before franchising was known to the economy of the United States granted an exemption from income tax, the business leagues, Chambers Of Commerce and Boards of Trade."
1978.77-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.987,512.99,What would you think about a baseball league under that statute?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,512.99,537.086,"I don’t know why football leagues, I confess have been preferred of a baseball leagues, I do not know. I have no knowledge of that but in any event the only reason now that we’ve been denied the exemption is the claim that a business league must be similar to a Chamber of Commerce or a Board of Trade."
1978.77-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.545,676.51,"When with this regulation that you handed up adopted, do you know?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,676.51,679.828,It was adopted into the 1926 statute.
1978.77-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.619,687.087,The statute of regulation?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,687.087,688.202,"Well, the regulations are."
1978.77-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.92,705.91,What I’m trying to get at is the contemporariness of the regulation.
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,719.605,735.631,"No, I suggest that I know what was in effect since 1926 and it may have been in effect, perhaps Mr. Smith knows more about that than I do at the moment, to best of my knowledge that was the rule all the way back to the adoption of the statute."
1978.77-1172,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,735.631,740.28,That certainly is reason to track down regulations were still --
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,740.28,750.497,"And if I may submit the other regulations, I have to conclude the argument, I would be grateful for the opportunity to do so, so that Your Honors have the full picture."
1978.77-1172,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,887.932,893.409,Well certainly there are distinctions between a professional football league and a Chamber of Commerce?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,893.409,895.781,"There certainly are, sir."
1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.723,958.066,Has anyone shed any light on why basketball leagues and baseball leagues are not in the Act except that perhaps they didn’t lobby --
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,958.066,959.602,"No, it may very well be that."
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,988.43,994.572,"It also true, years ago football teams weren't worth anything?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,994.572,995.817,"That may be sir, that may be --"
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.817,998.482,Very well true --
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,998.482,1031.173,"But we looked at the, see if there is any legislative history that would shed any light and the government says the only legislative history it has found is some representations to Congress back when the exemption was originally adopted by the United States Chamber of Commerce glorifying the effect of non-profit associations of a businessman."
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.411,1153.483,"So you would take the same position, if the regulation had always been like it is now?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1153.483,1154.605,"I could, I could take that –"
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.605,1155.29,You would --
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1155.29,1164.077,I would because I think that regulation was indented to do something less than is now and claimed for it.
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.483,1235.672,"Well, how long is the statute been interpreted and applied as the government is seeking to interpret and apply it?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1235.672,1238.044,"Only since 1929, Your Honors."
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.044,1240.153,Only since 1929?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1240.153,1244.669,But the first sixty years which I think might be a lot closer to the original --
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.669,1264.122,"Well, let's assume from the very outset that it had interrupted and applied the law this way and the revenue code had gone through all the changes that it has gone through since then and the statute was never amended."
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1264.122,1269.58,I would say that under circumstances we would have the different case but we do -- this is not the same case here.
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.559,1291.837,Well may be that if the Commissioner could have applied it the way -- from the outset the way he now wants to apply it that just at 1929 he changed his mind and you had a good many cases where government officials have changed their mind and both interpretations have been within the statute.
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1291.837,1307.955,"It would strike me that if in fact the Commissioner did change his mind there should been logical reason for the change of mind and they should have been something in either the judicial precedents or in the review of the congressional intent, which would indicate that’s what should have been done."
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.955,1319.019,"Well I know, but if he has power to issue regulations, he has power to issue regulations and his regulation reflects one view of the statute, doesn’t it?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1319.019,1326.824,"But on the other hand that, yes its true, it reflects his view of the statue, but unless that view is reasonable."
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.691,1369.894,The Commissioner obviously never acquiesced --
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1369.894,1371.863,"He did not acquiesce, that is correct."
1978.77-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.863,1377.584,And so in every other Circuit he was still applying the law the way he read it?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1377.584,1384.16,It may very well being that he was applying the law that way but as I say I do not know of any specific cases.
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1527.59,1529.964,Wasn’t that involved in the Dairy Queen case?
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1529.964,1530.755,I beg your pardon sir.
1978.77-1172,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1530.755,1537.654,"Wasn’t that involved in the Dairy Queen case in the Second Circuit, I mean court – wasn't that point in there?"
1978.77-1172,0,35917,myron_p_gordon,,1537.654,1539.484,I don’t think so sir.
1978.77-1172,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.557,1606.715,"Very well, Mr. Smith?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1606.715,1609.767,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1626.442,1631.952,Mr. Smith you will comment on the form of the regulation prior to the 1929?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1631.952,1634.826,Yes I shall.
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.074,1678.225,You are not going to answer Mr. Justice Blackmun's question right now.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1678.225,1678.846,I will be happy to --
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.846,1686.552,"Well, I want to ask you a question but if you are going to ask -- answer his, I was not going to ask you mine, if you are not going to answer his now, I will ask mine."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1686.552,1689.443,I will answer his and then I will turn to you.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.862,1790.786,How about professional football?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1790.786,1794.614,Professional footballs leagues came in 1966.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1794.614,1794.932,Why?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1794.932,1798.812,I can address that separately.
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1799.827,1813.213,"Before you do Mr. Smith, certainly your footnote four is a blind footnote with respect to the pre 1928 regulations."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1813.213,1818.877,"Well, but we have another footnote, nine."
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1818.877,1830.8,"You nearly recite the earlier regulations are and just giving their title, but without pointing out the seemingly opposing analysis on those prior regulations?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1830.8,1847.808,"Well, the old regulations Mr. Justice Blackmun or the history of the regulations are discussed in detail in the Produce Exchange Dealers case, which is the old Second circuit case of Judge Swan which the Court of Appeals relied on in this case."
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1848.47,1851.61,"I will discuss in detail in your brief, I take it not."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1851.61,1896.595,"Not in the same detail no, but I think the point simply is that Commissioner in 1929 construed this -- changed his mind as Mr. Justice White put it and that is that intent of Congress as we set forth in our brief is that this statute came in the 1913 at the behest of United States Chamber of Commerce emphasizing the quasi public civic nature of these broad based organizations, organizations that are supposed to benefit a board spectrum of the business community and in 1929 the commissioner recognized that was the intent of the statute."
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1911.64,1913.175,There is nothing particularly wrong with this.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1928.974,1934.26,As we do and if we haven’t done so in detail I regret it.
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1934.26,1940.794,"I certainly was hung with your footnote 4, [Attempt to Laughter] it's brought to your embarrassing attention I would say."
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.794,1955.51,"Mr. Smith Congress takes a position that Chamber of Commerce is exempt because they are great for the country, then why wouldn’t General Motors be exempt when it was said that what was good for General Motors was good for the country?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1955.51,1965.169,Because Mr. Justice Marshal it's engaged in a business as the regulation says of regular business of kind ordinarily carried on for profit.
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1969.047,1972.894,Your next answer would be why football?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1972.894,1978.105,"Well, I think Mr. Gordon touched on it in part."
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1998.047,1999.798,Any suggestion to Football league?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1999.798,2001.723,Yes.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.723,2003.711,Name some?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2003.711,2008.24,You know the American league I would think – I’m talking about you baseball leagues and things like that.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2008.24,2010.337,They have been given --

1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.107,2017.334,"They are not the constitutional case under the with the Fifth Amendment, the equal protection component of the First Amendment."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2017.334,2018.853,I suppose so although --
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.853,2023.43,Not after (Inaudible) gone there?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2023.43,2024.602,[Attempt to Laughter] the shape of the ball --
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2024.602,2027.727,Now you are telling me that even though baseball leagues are not --
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2027.727,2030.069,No baseballs leagues have enjoyed the exemption.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2030.442,2032.236,"I know, just a minute Mr. Smith."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2032.236,2033.374,I am sorry.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2033.374,2039.07,"That's – that – nevertheless they added football league especially, why?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2039.07,2062.116,"The added football league specially it’s my understanding because the national football league operates a pension plan or the football league and it was, there was some concern expressed as to whether the pension plan constituted an inurnment for the benefit of the members and that might be disqualified under that basis."
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2076.643,2080.842,Don’t baseball leagues operate pension funds for baseball players?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2080.842,2083.737,I am not aware that baseball leagues do.
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2094.914,2099.737,"Under this regulation it would make no difference whether they do or do not have a pension plan, would it?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2099.737,2116.76,"Well the pension plan, you know it might be considered to be an inurnment for-- no that’s not so."
1978.77-1172,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2116.76,2124.285,But certainly a broad disclaimer whether or not they operate a pension plan?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2124.285,2126.197,"Well, that’s right."
1978.77-1172,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2138.908,2145.755,The football leagues operate for the beneficent purposes you described that are performed by Chambers of Commerce or to --
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2145.755,2150.722,"Well, they do in the sense that I think it was germane in this case."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.904,2176.569,Well in 1966 it didn’t include the American Football League?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2176.569,2178.577,"No, but that was a separate league as I understand."
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.577,2182.616,"Well if it so easy, why don’t we have a baseball team?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2182.616,2183.909,Discord.
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.909,2186.36,"No, no the District of Columbia."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2188.29,2195.977,"Oh, I am not saying that it’s entirely -- I am not saying that it’s very simple and I would like to turn actually to this case in a way --"
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2195.977,2198.183,It’s feels a monopoly isn't it?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2198.183,2199.332,"Well, it’s -- you know."
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.332,2201.591,Was it worse than --?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2201.591,2202.593,Well.
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2202.593,2207.118,"Even with a monopoly we can get a team I imagine, if we paid enough."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2207.118,2248.389,"I suppose that’s so, but I think the point of all this is, is that if Congress wants to legislate specifically with respect to professional football leagues, whether or not they administer a pension fund, that really doesn’t help the petitioner in this case, because I think that this case turns on the validity of the provision in the regulation that the activities of a C6 organization should be directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business and the Court of Appeals held in this case and I think quiet properly that this organization was not directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.091,2272.869,"Mr. Smith, if you finish out that third sentence in the regulation, after the words more lines of business, you go on to the language as distinguished from the performance of particular services for individual persons, which I take it is what is not permitted in exemption."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2278.84,2284.57,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the cases that we discuss in our brief cite some examples."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.844,2344.382,And you say that the Muffler Dealers Association here falls under the head of performance of particular services for individual --
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2344.382,2346.925,"Well, I would have to answer that question in two parts."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.071,2361.973,"Well, is that a two-part test?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2371.566,2376.558,One can read the regulation the way you suggested Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.558,2378.425,It's quiet difficult to read it otherwise?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2378.425,2383.875,"Well, but the courts have uniformly read at the other way as an existence of two different texts."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.565,2406.179,"What reason do those courts give for the inclusion of the words as distinguished from, if they are correct in their reasoning?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2406.179,2421.103,"Well, I think that, what those courts have said is essentially the – well I think the courts have read that sentence to provide for a positive requirement and also incorporating a negative requirement."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.597,2474.476,Then that’s another two part test really.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2478.281,2479.45,I supposed that’s right.
1978.77-1172,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2517.623,2531.53,"Couldn’t we talk on this record Mr. Smith, what would happened if one of these dealers decided to leave the Midas franchise and take of one of their competing franchises, could he still remain a member of this organization?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2531.53,2546.896,"On paper, yes, in the sense that what happened in this particular case was the corporation, the tax payers original bylaws provided that you had to be a Midas franchisee to be a member, they then dropped that more or less as a cosmetic."
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2578.389,2580.07,"Well, you would drop yourself as a member."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2588.065,2599.0,Well it’s possible I suppose one could continue to be a member in order to receive the benefit of what the competition was making.
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.0,2601.928,There would be no reason to continue to pay dues?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2601.928,2608.235,"Unless you felt there was some need to get some intelligence from the Midas operation, yes."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.235,2616.066,Mr. Smith you have said the whole purpose of this organization was to improve the competitive position of the members vis-à-vis other muffler dealers.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2622.109,2623.268,Well I don’t -- yeah.
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.268,2630.412,And what is there in the record that supports your view of the relationship?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2641.904,2655.967,Well I think that the -- the part of the facts that I was referring to are set forth in our briefed at --
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.967,2672.938,"I thought your argument was quite different that you in fact interpolated the word entire into the regulation and said that it must not only be directed to improving business conditions in one line of business, but it must improve business conditions in the entire line of business and you then defined the business to be muffler dealer."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2672.938,2674.102,"Muffler, I think you know it does --"
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.102,2678.155,"In other words, you pretty much adopt the reasoning of Judge Kylie’s dissent of the Seventh Circuit?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2678.155,2679.225,"Exactly, exactly."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.417,2686.411,It's only a fragment.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2686.411,2715.287,"Bottling soda is a line of business, but getting back to your question Mr. Justice Stevens, I think that the principle point -- the principle fact is that this association paid 50% of the course of a market study in order to maintain and strengthen the position of Midas in the muffler replacement business."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.149,2734.259,The market study and the --
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2734.259,2755.702,"And it was also, one other thing was that it setup a kind of monitoring of pipe prices in order to assure that it receives the lowest price for pipes prices from Midas International in order to make sure that it could, I suppose do its work at prices lower than the competition."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.702,2767.724,"There are a number trade associations that represent maybe 60%, 70% of an industry, they don’t have 100% membership because some of them emphasize certain aspects of the business, are they generally granted the exemption or not?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2769.967,2784.67,"Oh I don’t think you have to have a 100% requirement, but I think this case is in our view a blatant case because it essentially excludes by undisputed estimation 79% of the industry."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.67,2793.686,"What if everything they did would be beneficial to people in the muffler industry, but they happen to have their membership comprised just of the franchise dealers from Midas."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2811.415,2831.899,"I would think it probably would be, because, and I think the answer simply is that it's difficult for the service to administer a statute where you know you would say well this organization although it's not broad base, really provides direct and indirect benefits to the industry as a whole, while this one which is not broad based is pretty narrow."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.789,2852.309,Mr. Smith --
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2852.309,2854.921,And not have to rely on kind of the indirect benefit.
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.921,2863.927,"Mr. Smith, what if you had a Ford Dealers Association, would that be denied the exemption because it excluded the Chevrolet dealers?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2863.927,2867.983,"You had a Ford Dealers' exemption, yes it would be and the service has so ruled."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.983,2870.15,So it has to be an automobile –
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2870.15,2884.464,"You have to be automobile dealers, simply because -- in fact, there are all sorts cases involving Ford dealers that can federate for purposes of joint advertising and things like that."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2884.464,2894.192,"But can for instance, Chrysler dealers or American Motor Dealers Association have quite different common problems than Chevrolet dealers?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2894.192,2910.001,"They may well have different common problems and there maybe an advantage for them to get together and to discuss them, but the C6 exemption is limited to those whose activities are directed across at least a line of business."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2910.001,2915.025,Well I am surprised you haven't excluded automobile association because they don’t include the railroads.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2915.025,2934.439,"Well, I mean, of course, there are gradations of categorization and one could say I suppose there ought to be, you know if you carry that to an extreme – there ought to be single trade association for business generally, but the service has wisely refrained from taking that position."
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2934.439,2937.303,This is even more on third question.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2946.747,2948.436,There was no conflict.
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2948.436,2951.711,Well you said --
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2951.711,2968.498,"We don’t like to trouble, in fact quite frankly Mr. Justice Franklin the acquiescence of this case was a big deal of concern to us only because an appropriate question to Mr. Gordan earlier, there was very little money involved in this case."
1978.77-1172,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2977.457,2980.935,If it had gone the other way would you will here petitioning for cert?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2980.935,2989.953,"I doubt it very much, but the point is we do think that the Second Circuit’s decision is correct and that the Seventh Circuit’s decision is incorrect."
1978.77-1172,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.953,2992.565,Is it (Inaudible) non-acquiescence in the Seventh Circuit?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2992.565,3004.343,"Yes in 1968 and the industry is on, in fact, in our acquiescence we pointed out that there were about 13 pending applications presenting this issue."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3051.1,3063.213,Am I not correct that you do grant the exemption to segments of an industry without being the whole industry that are arranged to bargain with the union for example?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3063.213,3081.326,"There is a ruling that is discussed in both briefs that says that but it's not, but it’s the segment, but if it’s a broad base of an industry would for example the power tool manufacturers or whatever rather than --"
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.326,3086.216,"Let say only 40% of the market gets together to do the bargaining with the union, that still would be exempt?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3086.216,3090.238,I think that would be all right assuming that the organization opens its doors to --
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.238,3094.007,"Well, here the doors are open as far as I understand the record, but nobody wants to come in."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3096.803,3114.526,"Well I think that really, if you permit me blinks in reality because while they change their bylaws they never made any attempt to solicit non-Midas dealers and I think Mr. Gordon would agree that they had no intention of doing that."
1978.77-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.542,3129.943,Do you feel they should have had affirmative action policy?[Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3129.943,3135.014,Well maybe in ten years we could see the results of all of those and the Court continues to hold the case I suppose.
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.014,3139.961,May be the line there but I have to confess I don’t see in terms of what they do in the business community?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3144.312,3151.702,Well they are significantly different because as Judge Kaufman said in short the bulk of the industries is excluded.
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.1,3157.378,"Well, the bulk of the industry doesn’t participate, but what you look it as quarter of an industry or half of an industry for example."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3174.934,3186.896,"Well I think the difference is simply is that this organization is pretty much of, you know in a way of an adjunct of Midas in the sense that it's designed to boost the competitive --"
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.896,3189.622,"But its purpose is it to bargain with Midas, not to --"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3189.622,3195.857,"Well that’s, but that’s also, but you know I mean, that’s true, that’s part of its activities as well."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3200.493,3206.141,We have farm groups that bargain with the farmers I mean you know milk dealers bargain with farmers over milk price.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3206.141,3221.049,"But I think the bargaining aspect of it is not necessarily controlling because I think as the Second Circuit said in the footnote towards the end of its opinion, in pressing this argument the association knows the similarities between itself and labor unions which are granted an exemption under 501 (c)(5)."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.153,3260.832,"Well it’s a big difference alright, but what does it have to do with collecting taxes, that what I don’t see."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3265.11,3268.272,Policy in this area is always difficult.
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3349.856,3353.63,Well now how could Congress speak beyond the way it’s spoken?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3362.285,3364.033,I suppose Congress could speak I mean --
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.033,3365.172,Isn't that the question?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3365.172,3365.821,That is the question.
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3365.821,3367.303,"That’s the precise question, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3367.303,3368.801,"Congress, sir, yes that it true."
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3368.801,3377.341,"And, of course, the petitioner says Congress has spoken by excepting business leagues from taxation and that his client is a business league?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3377.341,3378.713,It’s hard to imagine that.
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3389.207,3391.562,I was saying Midas Muffler Dealer’s Association Inc.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3391.562,3395.574,"Well it wouldn’t have to go, it wouldn’t have to go into such crass detail."
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3414.656,3416.996,"Definitely but here it hasn’t been, it’s quite general."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3416.996,3426.471,"It’s been quite general, but yet since, for the last 50 years the regulations have filled that gap and we think quite properly so."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3427.401,3431.039,What if the regulations fill the gap for the baseball league?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3431.039,3432.511,What if the regulation filled --
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.511,3436.158,How did the regulation fill the gap to allow the exemption for the baseball leagues?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3436.158,3448.128,They did – the regulations did and my understanding is that the activities of a baseball league are directed to the improvement of business conditions across a line of business of baseball activity.
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3466.955,3470.329,"But definitely baseball does have its own pension program, the league runs it."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3470.329,3471.695,"It does, it does."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.646,3481.727,"Well it hasn’t here, I think everybody agrees with that."
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3481.727,3482.202,Right.
1978.77-1172,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3495.417,3500.532,Can you tell us that under the football language they’ve included baseball if I understood you correctly?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3500.532,3505.572,"No, if I said that I didn’t mean to say that."
1978.77-1172,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3536.679,3540.417,The only thing (Inaudible)
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3540.417,3543.378,"The shape of the ball is different, that is true. [Attempt to Laughter]"
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3543.378,3552.715,"Well, in any event the amendment by Congress which included football league did operate to deprive you of your noscitur a sociis?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3552.715,3561.142,"No I didn’t think – no Mr. Justice Stewart I don’t think does deprive us of that, because I think that you know, I think that just has to put aside."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3562.661,3565.136,Well if you put it aside then is still have the argument.
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3565.136,3576.565,"No I'm saying, I think that professional football is so different than everything else that precedes, that our argument noscitur a sociis still applies to the first three phases of that paragraph."
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.565,3578.967,If you forget about the football league.
1978.77-1172,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3578.967,3590.671,"Mr. Smith isn't really all that’s at stake in this case is that if your are right these associations have to be careful at the year end and adjust their dues periodically and avoid getting any income, isn't that all at stake here?"
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3590.671,3595.386,"Of course and if they have done that I suppose we wouldn’t be here, but --"
1978.77-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3595.386,3597.937,Litigating over an awful trivial issue?
1978.77-1172,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3597.937,3621.104,"I think it is – you know it is not one of the humdingers of the court’s term, but nevertheless I think that you know we do have here a situation where income does expenditures and the case has to be decided accordingly."
1978.77-1172,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.104,3625.477,Do you have anything further Mr. Gordon?
1978.77-1172,2,35917,myron_p_gordon,,3625.477,3638.983,"No, I would only add one thing if Your Honors please and that is that there is no basis whatsoever for the argument made by Mr. Smith that this organization was formed to enhance the Midas program in any way."
1978.77-1172,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.752,3677.483,Thank you gentlemen.
