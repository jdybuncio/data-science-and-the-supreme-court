2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.48,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1109, McKinney versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,5.48,15.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State seeks to put James McKinney to death even though he's never once had a sentencing proceeding that complies with current law."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,125.84,132.68,"Well, what -- what about Clemons? Because Clemons is a precedent of this Court that says that the appellate court can do reweighing."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,134.68,137.16,So we're on question 2. And --
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,137.16,137.64,Yes.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,137.64,141.48,"-- and with respect to question 2, Clemons is not an Eddings case at all."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,153.48,153.72,Right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,165.64,184.0,"Because what the Arizona Supreme Court task had to deal with here was a full-blown reweighing of everything, mitigating and aggravating circumstances, whereas subtracting one element is very different. And, indeed, we know this from Clemons itself, Justice Kavanaugh, because the very end of Clemons actually brackets this case."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,207.48,215.68,"That's a lot of the argument that Justice Blackmun raised in dissent in Clemons, of course, that the appellate court wasn't well suited to do this, that this was really a mistake."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,215.68,216.24,Correct.
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.96,250.52,Mr. Katyal --
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,250.52,251.36,Let me give you a --
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,251.36,258.2,"-- the -- the court below only reached your first issue, whether this was a new proceeding or not."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,267.28,267.56,We --
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.56,277.8,"You -- you have presumed that it would have to do Ring, but my colleague, Justice Kavanaugh, has raised a question of why not."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,320.72,322.36,"Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you have to here."
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,329.12,329.96,"Well, that's your argument."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,334.0,338.76,"Well, I think the appellate court here has pronounced on question 1 and said effect --"
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.76,341.6,"No, if we disavow it over that pronouncement."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,377.52,378.76,"So, Justice Sotomayor --"
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,378.76,380.64,"And we -- that -- that's your argument, right?"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,380.64,381.32,Absolutely.
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.84,383.28,That it was a new proceeding.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,388.92,392.72,"If you want to rule for us on question 1, we're obviously not going to be opposed to that."
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,419.52,424.04,But they decided the question on a narrow ground that this was not a new procedure.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,435.44,437.32,"I'm not sure that they left it open, Your Honor."
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,443.6,450.88,"Well, at what stage of the -- of the direct appeal was there an error according to the Ninth Circuit?"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,450.88,458.92,The -- there was an error -- if we're talking about -- there was an error both at the trial court and at the Arizona Supreme Court.
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.92,461.84,But the Arizona Supreme Court conducted de novo review --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,461.84,462.28,Correct.
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,462.28,469.44,-- was it not? So wasn't the error identified by the Ninth Circuit an error committed by the Arizona Supreme Court?
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,469.44,470.04,And more.
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,498.16,498.92,All right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,533.36,538.08,"If there were no trial court error on Eddings, we wouldn't be here. Our position is --"
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,538.08,539.08,What if there was -- all right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,551.44,557.0,And I don't think this Court's precedents allow the appellate court to fix the trial court error.
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.76,601.88,"Why -- maybe I must have the facts wrong, but -- maybe."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,641.76,643.04,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.04,646.04,"You're wrong about the causal, says the Ninth Circuit."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,668.68,683.96,"Because, in Eddings cases and in particularly Caldwell, this Court has said the trial court has to confront all this in the first place. At page 331, for example, you said: Whatever intangibles a jury might consider in its sentencing determination, few can be gleaned from an appellate record."
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.72,690.96,"Well, in Arizona, the sentencer is the appellate court."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,695.52,697.36,And what this Court's decisions --
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.36,698.04,Can't do that --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,698.04,705.4,"-- from Eddings on have said, no, you've got to remand to the trial court for a determination and not to the appellate court."
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.28,706.6,Okay.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,707.12,714.8,"And, Justice Breyer, in Arizona, State versus Bible says appellate courts can't take evidence and can't assess that kind of stuff."
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.16,716.56,All right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,744.4,744.56,So --
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.56,745.8,-- and that's not what's at issue.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,747.2,747.6,So our --
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.6,748.24,Can they say that?
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,748.24,749.48,-- position on question 1 --
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.48,749.56,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,749.56,754.64,"-- is that they've conducted a brand new sentencing proceeding and, therefore, current law applies."
2019.18-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.96,757.24,"Well, Ring would make you say that."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,757.24,765.6,"And they haven't really gotten into, except for just saying, oh, there's no Ring violation, what the possible violations are. Our brief at pages 30 to 34 does outline that --"
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,765.6,766.28,"Counsel, why --"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,766.28,775.12,"-- and says, you know, the weighing and the mitigating circumstance and the taking of an aggravating circumstance without a jury determination, any of those are separate Ring problems."
2019.18-1109,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,775.12,788.84,"So, on question 1, why would Ring apply? I mean, I guess the -- the issue is, is the defendant getting a kind of windfall if Ring applies? The error here has nothing to do with Ring."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,806.32,835.36,"We -- we don't think that there's a windfall here, and I'll explain why, but, if you do, that would just push you in the direction of question 2, in which you don't have that feature. But, with respect to a windfall, I don't think that exists here. All our argument is, is that the State is conducting a brand new proceeding, and that new proceeding has to comply with current law. So we're not trying -- trying to use the flaw, the Eddings flaw, to reopen old grievances and say, oh, there was this problem in the trial or that problem in the trial."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,851.64,852.76,You're requiring --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,852.76,854.2,-- but with what happened later.
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,854.2,862.92,-- you're requiring a new jury sentencing 28 years after the murders and after the victims' families have been through this for three decades.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,889.0,893.2,"Justice Kavanaugh, I think in many of the Eddings cases you've done exactly that."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,925.6,927.12,"Well, that was true in Clemons, correct?"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,927.12,927.52,Correct.
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,931.16,931.2,I know.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,931.2,932.56,"And, indeed, they bracketed that."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,932.56,941.52,"But the big point of the dissent in Clemons was, look, this is something a fact finder should do, the jury -- the fact finder, the trial court should do, which is hear all the evidence and do that weighing."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,941.52,941.52,Right.
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,941.52,945.16,"And that seems quite similar, and I still take your point, but quite similar."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,945.16,945.32,Right.
2019.18-1109,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.0,994.56,But the problem --
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,994.56,999.12,"Why are you really -- why are you not asking for a windfall? Indeed, maybe a double windfall."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1031.96,1038.16,So it's a limited correction to -- because the Ninth Circuit's invalidated this -- this sentence.
2019.18-1109,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1067.24,1071.16,"Well, but, I mean, there the ineffective assistance of counsel can have all kinds of effects."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1096.96,1099.12,I -- I couldn't disagree more profoundly with that.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1126.08,1126.84,Mr. Katyal --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1126.84,1127.72,-- in 2016.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1130.76,1139.84,"At the risk of a formalistic question, normally, states are the definers of their own procedures, their own state law."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1161.4,1163.24,"So, Justice Gorsuch, two big answers here."
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1168.36,1173.52,"But let's -- let's just say we are, okay? Let -- let -- stick with my hypothetical if you don't mind."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1173.52,1173.56,Sure.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1188.76,1189.48,I -- I accept --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1189.48,1189.88,-- of finality.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1189.88,1204.4,"-- that there could be a federal rule of decision for vindicating some federal constitutional principle, but what would be that federal constitutional principle? And wouldn't, whatever it is -- you're going to say due process or -- I -- I'm looking forward to that."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1217.36,1224.36,I think this Court has said that the -- that -- that it is purely a federal question and hasn't deferred in all of these different cases.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1224.36,1227.96,"Is it federal common law? I mean, I'm -- what's your source of law?"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1227.96,1230.84,I think -- it's Article III in the Supremacy Clause because --
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1230.84,1232.96,"Well, the Supremacy Clause vindicates --"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1232.96,1233.6,"Exactly, but --"
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1233.6,1233.72,-- other --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1233.72,1234.48,"Right, but if I could --"
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1234.48,1235.08,-- federal laws.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1235.08,1235.44,Right.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1235.44,1237.56,And so I'm -- I'm still waiting for what that other federal law is.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1237.56,1256.28,"It is that, if you allow state-by-state definitions of finality, allow them to define around the problem, then you have, for example, Batson problems and a return to the Linkletter world where Justice Harlan was so worried about the idea that you could just pick and choose when a state could apply current law and when they could say, oh, no, it's much more --"
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1256.28,1256.48,Right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1258.84,1261.72,"So we -- you know, we don't have a beef really with the standard of review."
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1274.4,1274.92,"Well, they say --"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1274.92,1275.32,-- this is a final --
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1275.32,1277.6,-- it's an independent procedure and that that's different --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1277.6,1278.24,Citing --
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1278.24,1280.72,"-- in Arizona, and it's kind of an unusual procedure."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1280.72,1281.36,"No, no, no."
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1289.04,1289.32,All right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1289.72,1290.64,Michigan versus Long.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1290.64,1292.36,Just suppose I disagree with you on that for a moment.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1292.36,1292.72,Uh-huh.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1292.72,1298.2,"You still want to win, right? So what standard of review would you have this Court apply in these circumstances?"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1298.2,1298.8,"Well, we would say --"
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1298.8,1300.84,Something stronger than rational basis review?
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1300.84,1307.48,We -- we would say that it doesn't -- that there is no reason for it to be deferential because you are talking about federal constitutional commands.
2019.18-1109,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1313.68,1313.88,Right.
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1313.88,1316.4,"-- whatever it is, here, this is met."
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1322.52,1323.24,Mr. Katyal --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1323.24,1323.88,-- weighing the --
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1323.88,1336.6,"-- in a lot of your -- your argument, you've talked -- you've talked about ineffective assistance examples, Batson examples, but not every violation of federal law cuts across the entire proceeding, as ineffective assistance or Batson."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1336.6,1337.08,Correct.
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1337.08,1340.08,Do you have a line to draw between those that do and those that don't?
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1340.08,1351.32,"Our -- our line, Mr. Chief Justice, is -- is, if the new proceeding violates current law, in that circumstance and in that circumstance only is there a constitutional -- our argument is limited to that."
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1351.92,1363.16,So there's no difference between sort of a surgical mistake that could be corrected and an entirely comprehensive mistake that infects the whole proceeding?
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1363.16,1363.36,No.
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1382.32,1389.72,"Well, but somewhere between ministerial and entirely comprehensive, there are things that are discrete and focused --"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1389.72,1390.04,Yes.
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1390.04,1401.0,"-- that suggest that a -- the -- the new -- new proceeding, to give you the benefit of that, is not one that can't be -- is one that can be cured relatively easily."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1401.0,1411.88,"Right, and our point, the line is -- and this is what Burrell and other cases say -- if the new proceeding requires an exercise of discretion, then current law applies to that new proceeding."
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1422.24,1422.64,Can I --
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1422.64,1424.24,-- of what happened in 1996.
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1424.24,1434.8,"So the part of Clemons that you say may still be good law, suppose that the appellate reweighing occurred not on direct review but on state habeas in the state supreme court."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1437.08,1441.84,So we don't think anything turns on the label state habeas or direct review or anything.
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1446.48,1453.48,"Could -- could they do that, though, the Clemons reweighing, in -- in the state habeas proceeding?"
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1453.48,1459.32,"If -- if they did the same thing here but called it collateral or habeas, it would make no difference whatsoever because, ultimately --"
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1459.32,1461.04,"So I think your answer is no, they couldn't do that."
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1461.04,1462.12,It's ultimately a substantive test.
2019.18-1109,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1462.12,1465.24,And why -- why not? Why can't a state do it in that fashion?
2019.18-1109,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1465.24,1470.64,Because then you'd give the state the power to relabel something collateral and evade Batson and things like that.
2019.18-1109,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.2,1495.92,"Thank you, counsel. General Skinner."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1495.92,1504.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I believe there's actually only one path forward here for Petitioner."
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1628.68,1659.44,"So, if the Court had done this proceeding -- it says it's not a reopening of the judgment, but, if it had done this proceeding and changed its mind and said, you know, it wasn't causally connected and we were following our old rule, but it was fairly powerful evidence and we think he shouldn't be subjected to death, could they, unless they reopen the judgment, have modified the judgment?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1659.44,1668.24,"They can -- they can modify the judgment in the same manner that a 2255 court can modify a judgment, which, you know, even in --"
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1668.24,1672.6,"How? You have to open it to modify it, don't you? You have to undo it to change it."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1676.72,1697.76,"There are -- Petitioner cites, for example, the Burrell case out of the Second Circuit, and that's an example where this Court has recognized that even in the context of a direct appeal, where you are making a change and it's the only change that can be made, and, here, there's only two sentences available, we believe that if the Arizona Supreme Court had decided that the mitigation was sufficiently substantial --"
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1697.76,1723.76,"But it -- it used a well-known exception in the law, a ministerial exception, and defined ministerial as being -- since I wrote it, I know what I said -- it defined ministerial as being with no discretion. You know, you enter the wrong date or you accidentally enter the wrong amount. If you had no choice but to enter X as opposed to Y, that's ministerial."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1731.0,1742.68,The 2255 context has cases that discuss -- a 2255 court is tasked with correcting a sentence and may well correct a sentence in connection with a collateral proceeding.
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1742.68,1744.56,"But that supersedes the old one, right?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1744.56,1746.0,We agree that it would supersede.
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1747.36,1747.6,All right.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1764.8,1772.72,That -- that standard would change 2255 proceedings into direct proceedings for purposes of retroactivity.
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1796.8,1809.4,"Could you go to my other question? It'll be my last of you. Assuming that we say that this was a reopening of the appellate procedure, do you lose automatically?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1809.4,1813.6,"To the extent that this is a reopening of the direct appeal, we believe --"
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1813.6,1814.52,Of the direct appeal.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1814.52,1828.24,"Of the direct appeal, then we would be back on direct appeal, and the Court would be overturning the State's conclusion about the nature of the proceedings, but that would place us into the realm of what this Court discussed potentially in Jimenez."
2019.18-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1841.96,1855.08,"But -- but, General Skinner, the Ninth Circuit found that the Arizona Supreme Court erred on direct review of the trial court judgment."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1897.96,1906.64,"Two examples that come to mind, Justice Ginsburg, of where a collateral proceeding can resolve a constitutional violation."
2019.18-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1935.0,1948.68,"I don't understand how it's collateral when the Ninth Circuit said you erred not in a collateral proceeding, you erred in direct review, so do direct review over."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,1948.68,1962.92,"So they didn't say do direct review over, but my point was that the Ninth Circuit, in engaging in harmless error analysis, is itself attempting to resolve a constitutional violation in a collateral proceeding. The Ninth Circuit is sitting in habeas."
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1972.44,1982.6,"Well, just on the same line, General, I mean, yes, it's a federal habeas proceeding, but federal habeas courts only have authority over state direct proceedings."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2010.88,2013.36,So there's a couple responses to that.
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2046.04,2048.0,"The Ninth Circuit allowed that, right?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2048.0,2049.72,"The Ninth Circuit allowed that, exactly, in Styers."
2019.18-1109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2062.88,2065.92,"Well, you're -- you've mentioned the language of the writ several times."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2072.64,2091.8,"Indeed it was in Styers. Petitioner returned to the District of Arizona and said you said these words in your conditional writ -- the exact words here, I might add -- and that was inadequate to satisfy the writ, and so I need to have an unconditional writ granted. And that is exactly -- if there is a concern that the Ninth Circuit demanded --"
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2091.8,2092.76,But just -- sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2095.52,2096.92,"Correct, and it was affirmed."
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2096.92,2100.84,And the Ninth Circuit said that it was not a violation of the conditional writ?
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2100.84,2101.76,Correct.
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2124.24,2140.08,"Sorry, so are you arguing that we should DIG this case, that we granted cert when we shouldn't have, that they should have done what they did in Styers and gone back to the Ninth Circuit to find out if there was a violation first and that we shouldn't be deciding that ourselves?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2140.08,2143.96,The Court certainly is in a position to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2176.08,2195.04,"When -- when you say that the proceedings were collateral, and putting aside the question of whether that gets you out of the obligation to apply new rules of constitutional law, is the labeling collateral, does that make a difference in terms of what the State Supreme Court actually does?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2195.04,2198.68,"It does, Your Honor. The -- there are two chief categories of differences."
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2217.64,2227.88,That may be -- I think you're answering a question I didn't ask. Assume that this had gone back to the state appeals court on direct review.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2239.72,2264.76,"I think -- I think I'm trying to get at that, which is, on direct, the Court would look through and has in multiple cases, in the Styers case, in the consolidated opinion here, will reject an aggravator and will go through and -- and make differences in terms of what is the aggravation and mitigation coming out of the trial court. But, on the second time around, it's been very clear in Styers and in the Hedlund opinion and here, there is no revisiting of the aggravation and mitigation."
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2266.04,2270.96,But I guess I'm -- I'm asking you to do it the second time around both ways.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2292.32,2294.04,I -- we don't have an example of that.
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2314.92,2348.04,"I guess the intent of my question is to suggest that the -- the correction -- the -- the analysis by which you say, okay, we have to correct the error and now that we correct the error, we have to decide whether that does or does not mean that we need to change the sentence, that you would -- you just have to do that either way. And the label is not what makes a difference, that you're essentially redoing what the direct -- what the state supreme court did on direct with the error corrected."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2348.04,2357.52,"So I -- I'm trying to get at the idea that in -- in a first direct independent review, there is much more done --"
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2357.52,2357.84,I know.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2357.84,2358.08,I -- I -- I --
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2358.08,2359.8,But the question is not the first one.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2359.8,2359.8,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2359.8,2364.44,The question is what happens after the Ninth Circuit says go correct the error.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2385.44,2396.92,"If the court had -- if the court were to engage in the type of specific correction that occurred here and they said that it was really indirect, it's possible they would do that."
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2435.4,2435.64,Could --
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2435.64,2437.36,-- including going to the aggravators --
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2437.36,2459.68,"-- could I ask, I think, maybe the same question? But if this had come up on -- to this -- this Court on direct, we'd said what the Ninth Circuit said, Eddings error, and sent it back to the Arizona Supreme Court, would that remand proceeding at the Arizona Supreme Court have looked different, I think, from the collateral proceeding that occurred here?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2459.68,2459.92,I --
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2459.92,2461.36,I think that's getting at the question as well.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2461.36,2461.48,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2462.68,2463.0,Same answer?
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2463.0,2463.4,It's a hard one.
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2472.6,2474.04,But why -- why would that be?
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2474.04,2474.04,Why?
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2474.04,2478.64,"I mean, usually, when we say go correct your error, we just mean go correct that error."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2480.92,2503.08,"I think it partly stems from the idea that there would have never been a -- it's possible that they would have done a more narrow analysis, but just because of how many steps Arizona has put in place as safeguards in the death penalty context, an independent review the first time around will address issues not even raised. If a defendant stands -- counsel stands up and says there are no sentencing issues, there will still be an analysis."
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2525.56,2530.56,"Still back at Clemons, I'm trying to figure this out."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2604.92,2606.36,That --
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2606.36,2607.4,You see where I'm going?
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2607.4,2612.84,I see where you're -- it begins with the question of whether the new rule that's announced applies.
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.24,2614.4,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2634.48,2637.56,"If Ring and Hurst apply to this case, we do not dispute --"
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2637.56,2638.08,All right.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2638.76,2639.76,-- that we don't have reasonable parameters --
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.76,2646.0,"-- but why in heavens name wouldn't they? I mean, of course, that's going to be the next thing I'd ask."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2690.76,2699.2,"A critical component here is the idea of what the Ninth Circuit identified, what the Ninth Circuit asked Arizona to do."
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2726.68,2729.08,And that's still true if it's Gideon v. Wainwright?
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2729.08,2730.28,There may be --
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.28,2730.56,"Ahh, I see --"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2730.56,2731.68,There is an exception to the --
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.68,2732.44,-- you're a little pushed there.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2732.44,2733.16,-- there's a -- there's --
2019.18-1109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.16,2738.52,"Well, I suppose it depends on the underlying determination whether those new rules are retroactive or not."
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.52,2738.96,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.96,2751.48,"In the one circumstance, you -- you would be evading the rule against -- or the -- your friend would be evading the rule against retroactivity, and in the other situation, I assume the State would not."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2751.48,2761.4,"Yeah, to the -- yes. Going back to the Gideon versus Wainwright example, there is an exception to the modern retroactivity framework for certain rules that may be so essential."
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.64,2770.88,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2770.88,2775.12,It may be that that is insufficient to satisfy the court that granted the habeas writ.
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.12,2775.36,All right.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2799.4,2800.8,"Well, 100 percent."
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.8,2801.32,So that's why you --
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2801.32,2801.64,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2802.0,2802.36,All right.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2802.36,2804.76,-- like going to Ring. Ring is not retroactive.
2019.18-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.36,2817.0,Uh-huh.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2817.0,2825.2,That -- any of those issues are properly before other courts and don't allow this Court to second-guess the nature of Arizona's proceedings.
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2825.2,2825.68,I guess --
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2825.68,2826.4,I think that --
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2826.4,2843.56,"-- General Skinner, the real question that Justice Breyer is asking is, call it reopening, call it redoing, call it whatever you want, but you're correcting what happened on direct appeal, and we -- and -- and -- and you're doing it now."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2857.36,2879.28,"I -- going back to the harmless error, had the Ninth Circuit remanded to the Arizona Supreme Court for harmless error analysis, it is not obvious to me at all that that would be an inadequate resolution of a non-structural constitutional violation and that you couldn't engage in a collateral harmless error analysis and -- and thereby correct the problem."
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2880.56,2904.48,"Well, possible, but maybe the reason that you're going to the harmless error case instead of your own case is that, in your own case, the error had to do with the fundamental question of sentencing, which is weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and coming up with the right sentence. And that you're having to do again because the initial inquiry had a constitutional defect."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2926.8,2930.76,It would apply to any new proceeding that is part of a direct review process.
2019.18-1109,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2945.28,2949.8,"Yes, but it's a reanalysis of an analysis that was done in the direct proceeding."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2955.84,2969.0,"I -- I -- the -- any -- the -- as this Court noted in Wall, any collateral proceeding is going to invariably entail a reexamination of something that occurred in a direct proceeding."
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2969.0,2971.48,"On the -- on the harm -- keep going, I'm sorry."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,2971.48,2990.12,"So -- and then crucially here, once -- our position is once a case is final on direct review, as this was 23 years ago, the touchstone for how you would undo that finality is to vacate the sentence. The Ninth Circuit in the District of Arizona knew exactly how to tell us that we had to vacate the sentence --"
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2990.12,3004.64,"On -- on the harmless error point, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question, I think you were saying that harmless error could have been done by the Ninth Circuit on habeas, and so, too, a state habeas court could do the harmless error analysis. Is that correct so far?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3004.64,3005.08,Yes.
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3005.08,3006.0,Okay.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3020.0,3028.72,"I think it is different to the extent that we are providing additional process to the defendant, and in -- in particular, but I think as a matter of type."
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3030.4,3032.04,"It's very similar, I think, is what you're arguing."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3032.04,3032.56,Yes.
2019.18-1109,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3035.44,3037.76,"In -- in Clemons, they -- they're analyzed back to back."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3037.76,3038.0,Yes.
2019.18-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.8,3045.92,May --
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3045.92,3046.48,"I'm sorry, could --"
2019.18-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3046.48,3058.72,"-- may I ask you a question about the -- the -- the error wasn't saying we won't count this mitigator, because there was no causal connection."
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3100.92,3101.28,Yes.
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3121.48,3134.24,Could -- you resisted Justice Kavanaugh a little bit when he was trying to equate the harmless error to this. And I think you started to say this was something more than harmless error review.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3135.56,3151.6,"My argument was that it was -- this is -- we believe this gives more process than harmless error review, but that, as a type, this is very similar to harmless error, and to the extent that harmless error is an available correction --"
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3151.6,3153.84,So what's the more process?
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3153.84,3154.32,The --
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3154.32,3156.8,"What's your definition of ""more process""?"
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3156.8,3177.4,"The more process is not analyzing -- as a part of harmless error, not analyzing what would an imaginary person have -- have done -- what would an imaginary set of judges or a jury done if this evidence had been considered but, instead, allow briefing and say we're going to now look at the evidence and make our determination."
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3177.4,3178.28,And that's what happened.
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3185.28,3186.56,In an original appeal --
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3186.56,3187.36,In a direct --
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3187.36,3187.96,Yeah.
2019.18-1109,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3230.8,3235.0,How would the process have differed for the issue that was identified as an error?
2019.18-1109,1,63204,oramel_h_skinner,,3235.0,3264.64,"If you focus down all the way on the consideration of the mitigation, there is a consideration of the mitigation in the same manner as the first time around, but that's zooming in past all the rest of the independent review and acknowledging that when you get down, that means we fixed it. We went back and looked at the thing that was identified as a problem, conducted the analysis without a causal nexus, and corrected the identified problem that the Ninth Circuit had said occurred in the Arizona Supreme Court. It's an appellate court correcting an appellate error on a built record."
