1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,38.74,43.657,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.359,142.802,You're going to tell us what those circumstances are?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,142.802,144.441,That's right.
1974.73-1742,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.408,365.085,Attainment date.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,365.085,367.24,-- of national standards.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.132,464.115,Is that to be made on a hearing?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,464.115,464.794,Exactly.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.938,474.741,Made on the record.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,474.741,479.713,"Made on the record, subject to adjudicative proceedings of the EPA."
1974.73-1742,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,479.713,480.898,That is postponement?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,480.898,486.377,That is for postponement and it subject to judicial review.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.167,890.167,Those approvals were on the assumption that limited variances would take the state or any stationary source beyond the attainment date.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,890.167,898.436,"Well, we'd not interfere with either attainment of those standards or maintenance of them after the attainment date."
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.071,915.756,Postponement of this -- of the -- under the state plan not a postponement of the attainment date such as 110 (f) which still permit.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,915.756,923.659,"Well, 110 (f) would permit the postponement of the applicability of a requirement of a state plan to a source."
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.364,947.303,"But 110 (f) I take it, would if you go to the 110 (f) procedures permit the state to postpone compliance beyond the attainment date --"
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,947.303,948.758,As to particular sources.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.758,949.571,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,949.571,952.15,It doesn't postpone the attainment date itself.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.15,965.719,"But your -- the agency's interpretation would not -- unless you comply with 110 (f), you couldn't go beyond the attainment date."
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,965.719,972.481,"Well, the original interpretation was not limited to the period prior to attainment."
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.684,986.508,-- carried it beyond the attainment date.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,986.508,989.167,That's right because it wasn't interfering with --
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.167,993.239,"Well, but then you change your mind because of the ports."
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,993.239,1000.245,"Well, I'll get to that, there was a change."
1974.73-1742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1513.775,1519.544,Does the Government show a preference for the First Circuit to the Ninth Circuit's?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1519.544,1529.171,"Well, we show a preference for EPA's original interpretation which is to root this flexibility in the explicit revision procedures of the Act."
1974.73-1742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1544.765,1545.643,But what about the Ninth?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1545.643,1551.701,"Well, as between the Ninth and the Fifth or the First, we prefer the Ninth."
1974.73-1742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.664,1563.231,I can see you preferred the Fifth to the First?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1563.231,1567.529,"No, the First to the Fifth given that choice."
1974.73-1742,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.529,1568.848,This is when you don't like --
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1568.848,1569.107,We don't like that at all.
1974.73-1742,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1569.107,1569.99,-- that means you're here?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1569.99,1572.515,That's right.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.48,1599.998,"Mr. Norton, just assume like you know are also now as well as any time whether the revision could extend beyond the attainment date."
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1599.998,1602.438,"Well, I'm not going to -- yes, play very rapid."
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.848,1612.913,That's not going to be -- I take it prospectively your position.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1612.913,1619.346,"Well, the agency hasn't formally reacted to the Ninth Circuit --"
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.346,1624.305,"Well, you're going to have to agree with some one court or the other --"
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1624.305,1624.958,But we --
1974.73-1742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1624.958,1627.606,"Just to wait on the agency pretty much, don't you?"
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1627.606,1628.502,Yes.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.021,1653.748,And the --
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1653.748,1654.679,Foreshadow the result --
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.679,1659.325,And it doesn't cover the post-attainment period that it shouldn't cover the pre-attainment either.
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1659.325,1661.489,"No, no."
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.489,1662.164,What?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1662.164,1668.88,We would very agree with the First Circuit that you can distinguish between the pre-attainment and the post-attainment.
1974.73-1742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.88,1671.052,But it isn't the same rationale then?
1974.73-1742,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1671.052,1676.588,"No, it's not to say rational, the same result."
1974.73-1742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1775.19,1778.009,Very well Mr. Norton.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,1783.289,1785.359,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.826,2299.702,"It's your position now, it wasn't always."
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2299.702,2306.79,"No, that's always been our position, unless you're referring to the statement before Congress that I made."
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2319.153,2326.326,We believe that its time that those were too lax and was also made in the context when we really had and looked at the law closely.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.326,2329.876,"And what forms of agreement during that time, at the time of --?"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2329.876,2331.736,That's right.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.544,2335.194,Four others are not?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2335.194,2338.397,"Well, four others have not."
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2689.26,2692.025,We stay it or does the Fifth Circuit stay it?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2692.025,2695.5,"Fifth Circuit refuse, denied a request for stay and of course --"
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2695.5,2698.651,Fifth Circuit denied the stay and do we do anything --
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2698.651,2699.38,Yes.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2744.914,2764.211,"So, we think that although we suggest that one alternative for how to deal with these variances are brief, perhaps an equally go to a better alternative is simply to make to affirm the lower court's ruling which would have prospective effect and leave the variances as they were called before in place."
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.211,2772.728,"So, you would enjoin the agency from acting in accordance with its -- with a contra review for the future?"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2772.728,2784.22,"For the future, we would have the agency under order to not to approve any such state variance and to order --"
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.22,2786.938,Except the postponement?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2786.938,2801.654,"Well, yes such a procedure would go through the postponement procedure that disapproval of the state variance law would leave only the procedural postponement to go through."
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.191,2837.628,EPA is not in compliance with Fifth Circuit rule?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2837.628,2848.228,"EPA -- well, they disapprove all state variance statutes in compliance with the First, Second, Fifth and Eighth."
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2877.908,2883.315,"Mr. Ayres, the complaint here, the court is filed --"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2883.315,2883.786,Pardon me?
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2883.786,2885.762,The original complaint.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2885.762,2887.036,Is it before the court?
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.036,2888.017,"Yes, no."
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2893.289,2897.493,This is the case which went directly to the Court of Appeals rather than to the District Court.
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.101,2905.449,Is this?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2905.449,2908.392,I think it's in there.
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.392,2910.609,You went from the agency to the Court of Appeals?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2910.609,2911.247,Yes.
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2918.071,2919.949,Is it the report?
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2923.207,2926.843,Petition for review.
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.936,2930.815,"Well, it would be in the record --"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2930.815,2931.252,Yes.
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.168,2943.364,"Noted, but it's not incorporated?"
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2945.094,2949.358,Are all of these things are here with the clerk?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2949.358,2951.027,I believe they are.
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2952.125,2953.163,We will you check and see?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2953.163,2954.309,We will check now.
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.309,2958.043,Thank you.
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2958.043,2972.371,The -- my brother Marshall's question raises one in my mind if it's going back to threshold of the matter of your -- the standing of your client's in this case.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2980.159,2982.487,"Well, we don't think there's any question of it."
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.648,2985.484,It was?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2985.484,2987.292,"Yes, and the court --"
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.292,2988.312,"Doesn't even mention of it, do they?"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2988.312,2995.596,"Well, it does mention, and so -- and since that is question that goes to jurisdiction, it must be presumed to decide in our favor, yes."
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2995.596,2998.873,But -- and it's not mention in the briefs here.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2998.873,3000.213,"No, it's not mentioned in the briefs here."
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.881,3017.501,I'm thinking of our decision in the Sierra Club case and so on -- what is your -- the injury to your clients in fact?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3017.501,3032.399,"Well, the injury in fact, Your Honors, that the petitioners here are a national organization with members in Georgia, Georgia organization, and two, Georgia resident."
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.547,3067.499,Or we have National Resources -- National Resources Defense Council Inc. at Allen and you get Allen includes two individual --
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3067.499,3067.867,Yes.

1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3075.416,3080.215,"Those are -- they are both residents of Georgia, yes."
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.215,3082.401,And Save is a Georgia --
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3082.401,3086.458,It's a Georgia non-profit organization.
1974.73-1742,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3086.458,3096.62,Do the two individuals live in the outsource that has sought a variance?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3096.62,3103.963,They live in areas where abatement actions had been undertaken.
1974.73-1742,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3108.795,3111.89,If that could shed light on this.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3111.89,3116.932,"I don't believe it does, no."
1974.73-1742,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3149.282,3152.784,Does the record show that number of members in Georgia?M
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3152.784,3155.007,"I believe it does, yes."
1974.73-1742,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3170.646,3174.03,"I gather you have some 16,000 members?"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3174.03,3178.635,"Approximately, yes."
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3178.635,3181.39,"It was briefed you say, was it at issue that the Government --"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3181.39,3187.244,"Well, it was not raised in the briefs some -- in chief on the case."
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3193.977,3194.943,"On both sides, so it --"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3194.943,3195.422,On both sides.
1974.73-1742,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3195.422,3196.919,-- it's an adversary briefing.
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3196.919,3199.674,"Yes, it was."
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.674,3205.489,"What's the statutory language, any interested first?"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3205.489,3226.047,"The statute -- the section suit undergoes to the proper court, that is to say, it says of suit to review the administrator's action and approving specific state implementation plan shall be filed in the appropriate circuit."
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3226.047,3229.394,"But doesn't it say by any interest, isn't the language any --"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3229.394,3230.113,There is a --

1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.81,3315.64,We'll just address to the statutory question as to what Congress intended -- the parties might -- who the parties might be or was -- did you address the constitutional question?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3315.64,3335.807,We addressed both the issue of the attributes in the parties and the requirements of the statute and the general requirements this Court has enunciated with respect to standing in general.
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3335.807,3339.43,Would your petition show standing?

1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3343.316,3346.455,Does it show anything about standing?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3346.455,3347.837,"No, it doesn't allege anything about standing."
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3347.837,3353.446,"But where do we get the standing process, the factual basis for the stand?"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3353.446,3356.19,"Well, I think there are two ways of answering that."
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3362.275,3371.514,"Did note two with that my question, I mean where in the record is the material we can use to find out whether or not your client have standard --"

1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3385.883,3386.266,Oh!
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3389.099,3391.021,"Yes, there are affidavits in there."
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3391.021,3394.06,Are they acceptable evidence that we could consider?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3394.06,3403.692,"Well, there's a difficult -- I think they are, but there's a difficult problem here and that this case arose before the Court of Appeals was not before a court that was really equipped to take evidence."
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3403.692,3408.201,"-- do we have a case, a controversy without that standing."
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3408.201,3410.337,"Well, I think there's no question that there is a case of controversy."
1974.73-1742,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3410.337,3419.077,You say for example that these organizations are in there because some of their members in Georgia will breathe that air.

1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3428.365,3431.489,"Well, the Ninth Circuit held that it didn't."
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3431.489,3438.738,The Ninth Circuit -- that decision with respect to standing is still on petition for rehearing in the Ninth Circuit.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.738,3440.904,"Well, I understand that nevertheless --"

1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.905,3453.809,Your members as individuals could sue?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3453.809,3454.508,Yes.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.508,3456.173,But not the organization?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3456.173,3473.468,"We held that an organization could only sue if the organization was injured in a way identical without of the members, and we believe that is wrong under a long line of your cases, and that's why we sought petition for rehearing."
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.137,3489.125,But you think there's no question of the standing of a resident of Georgia for example to attack the adequacy of the Georgia --
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3489.125,3490.011,I think there's not.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.958,3496.105,"Any resident, not just your members, but --"

1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3510.835,3512.031,"That's right, their parties --"
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.031,3512.658,Independent.

1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3520.474,3560.563,"Mr. Ayres, take a look at 63 (a) if you have it there of the Government's petition which sets forth that some of the statutory language, and -- I can't keep all these sections straight, but was subparagraph capital B that begins about the middle of 63 (a), “any determination made person to this paragraph shall be subject to judicial review by United States Court of Appeals for the circuit which include State upon filing in such court within 30 days of such decision of a petition by any interested person.”"
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3565.434,3565.776,No.
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3574.294,3582.12,And what is the Section then that authorizes review of this administrator's action which you sought to have a review in the Fifth Circuit?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3582.12,3591.783,"That is Section 307 of the Act, which is Section 1857h-5."
1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3591.783,3598.133,Did you know where it is in the Government's brief or your brief?
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3598.133,3600.327,I'm not sure that it is.
1974.73-1742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3600.327,3601.493,In that proceeding?

1974.73-1742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3604.475,3605.184,Oh!
1974.73-1742,1,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3611.284,3622.077,"This -- the issue of that Section is briefed in the briefing that was done the court below in standing, so it would be clear from that I think."
