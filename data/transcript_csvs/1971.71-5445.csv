1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.779,"-- next in number 71-5445, Shadwick against City of Tampa."
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,30.605,33.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-5445,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,55.592,62.71,"Mr. Rezneck, let me know at the start, has Mr. Shadwick ever been tried and convicted?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,62.71,64.571,No sir.
1971.71-5445,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,64.571,67.411,"Well, do we have a final judgment here then?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,67.411,69.646,I believe that you do.
1971.71-5445,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,84.901,86.661,"Well, it is a final judgment under federal statute --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,86.661,89.106,"Well, I believe that it is."
1971.71-5445,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.686,169.811,"Was that passed upon specifically in Camara, Mr. Rezneck?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,169.811,170.708,That particular issue?
1971.71-5445,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.708,170.944,Yes.
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,170.944,190.908,"I do not believe that it was raised and that issue was litigated as to whether it was a final judgment or not, but since that I suppose would be deemed a jurisdictional matter for this Court, I think the fact that this Court went on to decide the case, does decide the jurisdictional issue, at least by implication."
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,291.978,299.194,"Tell me Mr. Rezneck, are these clerks permitted some times as substitute for the judge as an a acting judge?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,299.194,300.884,"No, I don't believe so."
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.321,306.26,Only in the judge?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,306.26,307.003,Yes.
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.003,322.749,"Because I know in my own state, local police magistrates, clerks could by statute, exercise judicial powers I believe of the police judges in certain instances when the police judge himself was absent, that's not so in --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,322.749,329.471,"No as I understand the Florida law, the only judicial function which is confided to the clerk is the issue on certain arrest warrant."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,338.981,342.973,"That's by virtue of the limitation that the Florida legislature imposed, is it not?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,342.973,343.805,"Yes, that’s correct."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,343.805,347.978,"In other words, they gave a limited quasi judicial power to the clerk?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,347.978,349.872,"Yes, that is precisely, yeah, right."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,349.872,355.383,How is that very much different from what's done in the federal system?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,355.383,371.716,"Well, I think it is very much different because the arrest warrant powers lodged in only -- first of all it must be lodged in a judicial officer in the federal system and that means either a federal judge or a United States magistrate, those are the only officers who would constitute the judicial officers for purpose."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,371.716,375.182,"How about the commissioner, when we had the commissioners?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,375.182,377.429,"Well, the commissioners were judicial officers at that time."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,378.603,384.533,Was there a time when the United States commissioners were not required to be lawyers?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,384.533,388.883,They were not required to be lawyers until the United States Magistrates Act was passed in 1968.
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.883,403.998,"So, until 1968, would you say that the posture of a United States commissioner was very different from that of the clerk exercising these functions in this case?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,403.998,407.604,"Yes, I would say that it was because he was clearly a judicial officer."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,421.62,425.895,"But to whom is the clerk of court responsible, Mr. Rezneck?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,425.895,430.306,"Well, I think that it is not at all clear from the Florida statutory structure."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,479.266,487.518,You don't think this clerk is responsible solely to judicial authority when he is performing quasi judicial duties?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,487.518,496.779,"Well, what I meant was that, in terms of his jobs, the appointed power, his responsibilities also run to the clerk who appointed him."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,533.304,536.857,"Well, is there anything that says he is not neutral?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,536.857,538.671,Is anything that says he is not neutral?
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.581,543.003,Is there anything to say that he is not detached?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,544.997,562.009,"No, we are not alleging that he is connected with the Police Department, but we do not think that this case ought to turn on an inquiry into whether a particular clerk or deputy clerk is impartial or neutral or detached or capable as an individual of having those qualities."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,580.112,587.888,"Yeah, but the Florida statute has any limitation on the ability of a magistrate?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,587.888,590.356,"Well, the magistrate is purely a judicial officer."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,590.356,593.588,"Yeah, but they don't say what he has to be?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,593.588,594.021,Well --
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,594.021,596.947,"It doesn't say he has to be detached, does it?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,596.947,598.772,"No, but I think that the assumption would be taxed on the inference --"
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,598.772,602.074,What does the Florida statute say about magistrates?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,602.074,605.126,"It doesn't deal with the point of detachment in those words, but I --"
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,605.126,606.946,"(Voice Overlap) any state, I ever heard."
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,606.946,614.156,"No I think the inference of detachment and neutrality arises from the fact, that he is clearly a judicial officer."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.6,624.563,Well how long the clerk has?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,624.563,625.192,Pardon me?
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.192,625.946,How long does the clerk --
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,625.946,629.017,The clerk is under – is a civil service employee.
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,641.358,648.652,"Well, I still don't see the tie-in between him acting as a magistrate and acting as a clerk?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,648.652,654.806,"But his primary duties are, clerical duties and they are the usual duties that one would associate with a clerical job."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,657.201,663.454,"Suppose the law says that, deputy clerk of any country may also act as magistrate?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,663.454,678.117,"In effect that's what Florida has done here, that's what the Florida Supreme Court giving him the title of magistrate, without giving him any of the status of the judge, without changing his essential status from that of a clerical officer --"
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,678.117,681.566,You keep saying the status of a judge.
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,683.447,686.629,"They do not have the name of judges, they do not have the title of judges, but --"
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,686.629,688.713,And they don't have the authority of judges?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,688.713,691.627,"Well, I think that they exercise judicial authority."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,696.398,697.954,Is that true in Florida?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,697.954,702.681,"Yes, the magistrates, such as the municipal court judges have a four-year term."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,704.544,708.055,But no qualification is required?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,708.055,711.024,"In a Tampa, they have to be members of bar."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,711.024,711.854,Magistrates?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,711.854,713.873,"Yes, municipal court judges."
1971.71-5445,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,713.873,715.05,Sitting at bench.
1971.71-5445,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,715.05,722.093,"Does Florida law require the court magistrates with authority to the issue warrants, must be lawyers?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,722.093,739.604,"No, under a new constitution which is going to go and which has been approved in Florida, and that will become effective several years from now, all judges with the exception of county judges and counties of small population below a specified limit will have to be members of the bar."
1971.71-5445,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,739.604,745.583,Who issues warrants in felony cases in Florida or does it vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,745.583,767.977,"Under the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedures as I understand them, either a felony or a misdemeanor warrant, may be executed, may be issued by one who is defined as a committing magistrate under the rules and committing magistrates include all the judges and magistrates of the courts authority down to including the municipal court judges and the justices of the peace."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.889,842.313,Mr. Rezneck for Fourth Amendment purposes if a police officer had left over the facts here and thought that there was probable cause to arrest and went out and arrested without a warrant at all.
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,847.925,850.835,"Well, I think that would involve the question what --"
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.835,854.406,Let's suppose -- assume for the moment that there was clearly probable cause.
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,854.406,857.016,"Yes, He could not do under Florida law."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.016,858.099,How about the Fourth Amendment?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,858.099,870.573,"Yes, well I think, that would require the decision by this Court which I don't leave has been made ever as to what the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment are with respect to municipal ordinances."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.336,895.035,"Well, that was the common law, what about the general proposition of the police being able to arrest without a warrant, without a probable cause?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,895.035,906.09,"I think that there is a legislative authority in some situations certainly, and I know it has been exercised here in the District of Columbia to give the police the authority to arrest on probable cause for certain misdemeanors."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.09,908.073,And then what about the states?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,908.073,912.702,"I assume that there are similar statutes in the state, and I think that will allow --"
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.702,914.613,Would you say to that's unconstitutional?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,914.613,925.867,"No, I don't think so, I think that there would be a power in the legislature to define a reason to resemble search procedure to that extent, but I would point out we're not dealing with that here because Florida has the authority to do that."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.867,933.232,"Now, it's purported to say that a clerk can determine probable cause and authorize an arrest?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,933.232,938.283,"Yes, but it requires a warrant, in other words, this is an arrest warrant which is required under the state law."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.283,951.205,"But you would say, Florida could authorize the police authority -- the legislature could authorize police themselves to determine probable cause and make an arrest?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,951.205,963.824,"For this kind of offense, I'm not sure that I would want to see that because I don't think that we're dealing with this kind of offense that you have the sort of necessity that might justify that practice."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.824,966.77,"For a more serious misdemeanor, for a felony it would --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,966.77,976.261,"Well for a felony, I think it's clear under the common law and under the Fourth Amendment which incorporate the common-law rule that a police officer can arrest on probable cause without a warrant."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.261,980.908,"But he may not do for, do so for a less serious municipal offense?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,980.908,983.427,"Well, certainly a common-law he could not."
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.491,1015.932,"But the Florida court here has said that under Florida law that the clerk is sufficiently independent to perform his function as a matter of Florida law, I gather?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1015.932,1017.027,Well I think that --
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.027,1018.208,In your opinion anyway --
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1018.208,1021.635,-- that is a conclusion drawn by the Florida Supreme Court.
1971.71-5445,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.207,1046.128,There is nothing in the statute that indicates that he isn't neither or that the Florida Supreme court is wrong and as a matter of judicial judgment investing at this Court with some independence?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1046.128,1057.777,"Well, I think that you have your supervening federal question it seems to me under the Fourth Amendment as to who is a neutral and detached warrant for Fourth Amendment purposes and that's a federal question."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1085.814,1093.658,"Well, tell me again then, what is the source of his authority to the issuing the warrant, from what does it derive?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1093.658,1110.541,"From the statutes of Florida, one statute of general applicability which gives clerks of the municipal court the authority to issue warrants in municipal ordinances cases and then from two specific statutes applicable in Tampa which are part of the Tampa City Charter."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1110.541,1116.67,"Isn't kind of legislative decision that these are proper officers, as Mr. Justice White suggested?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1116.67,1119.84,"Alright, absolutely we are dealing with a legislative act here."
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1188.971,1203.146,"You say Mr. Rezeck you're not, of course you're not relying on the title and the label of clerk, but you're rather relying on the nature of this man's job and duties and position."
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1203.146,1204.719,Yes.
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.719,1207.286,"Where does that appear in the record, I looked for it and I --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1207.286,1207.556,Well --
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1207.556,1228.208,"I gather that what you say is correct that this is the only -- that his authority to issue arrest warrants for violations of municipal ordinances is the only power, the only duty he has in his job, is to perform any task that have traditionally been considered judicial tasks."
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1233.032,1234.496,It's not in the record before you.
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1247.599,1253.693,What is he -- does he file papers and keep track of them or send in the courtroom and act as bailiff or --
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1253.693,1254.583,Some of them do that.
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.583,1255.66,What does he do?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1255.66,1268.853,"He receives fines, for example, and gives receipts for fines in traffic cases, he prepares the dockets and the records, he issues the commitment, once a judge has ordered as opposed to sentence on seomone the deputy clerk makes out the commitment --"
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1268.853,1273.601,"Equivalent of a clerk’s office in any court, in this court or any court?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1273.601,1279.83,Yes and more specifically I would say in any police court or any municipal court in the country that you’ll find --
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.83,1283.687,"Track of fines paid, and disbursements and --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1283.687,1285.94,(Inaudible) if the case is continued --
1971.71-5445,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1285.94,1288.358,(Voice Overlap) payroll for the court?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1288.358,1288.917,that I don't know.
1971.71-5445,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1293.537,1296.478,Does he issue subpoenas?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1296.478,1300.989,"Yes, he’s, I believe, the power to issue to subpoenas."
1971.71-5445,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.989,1327.942,"Mr. Rezneck, if Florida by legislation could authorize a policeman to arrest, if there were in fact probable cause in this situation without a warrant and if in fact there is a probable cause in this case, do you have really a Fourth Amendment point, simply because the policeman has taken a warrant issued by a clerk, that made a finding of probable cause?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1327.942,1340.705,"Well, I think that you do because I think that's Florida has utilized the arrest warrant procedure here and it has made a determination that it's not proper for a policeman to arrest simply on a probable cause for offenses not committed in their presence."
1971.71-5445,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.253,1342.502,That’s a State Law point?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1342.502,1342.932,Yes.
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1410.353,1420.772,"Mr. Rezneck, how would you categorize the power to issue a warrant, a subpoena rather as distinguished from a warrant?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1420.772,1434.724,"I think that that would be wholly ministerial power that would not be classified as a judicial power, because you do not have the elements of discretion and judgment that enter into the warrant decision."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1443.871,1455.341,"But then when we’ve considered the traditional language of a subpoena, it usually has the arcade form of briefing."
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1479.089,1480.056,No I don't dismiss it.
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1582.899,1593.567,"Mr. Rezneck, if this is the part of statute, I'm looking at your brief at page 3, and that third line after -- and where it took and may issue a warrant --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1593.567,1593.869,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1593.869,1600.617,"-- that were -- if that had been there and may on a finding of probable cause issue a warrant, what would your position be?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1600.617,1602.129,As far as the clerk is concerned?
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1602.129,1602.633,Yes.
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1605.794,1615.626,Our position would be exactly the same because the Florida courts have read in a requirement and I think this case does it that the clerk must find probable cause.
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1634.736,1655.523,"And I take it, your position be the same if the statute said only that the clerk may exercise the powers of the local magistrate insofar as he may administer an oath, take an affidavit so forth and issue of warrant, what would you think of that?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1655.523,1658.242,"I think he could administer the oaths, I think --"
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1658.242,1667.261,"No, but if the statute said that the clerk may exercise the powers of the local magistrate and he suspects?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1667.261,1669.963,"Then I don't think it will be any different, I think it will be the same case."
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1669.963,1671.095,It'd still be here?
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1671.095,1684.346,"Yes, that they would be confining to the clerk a judicial determination, the probable cause without giving in any of the status or qualifications of an independent judicial officer, that they could not do that."
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1684.346,1694.181,"You mean, they have at least to go to so far as to say, the clerk in the absence of the magistrate may perform the functions of the magistrate?"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1694.181,1701.463,"Well, if the functions of the magistrate is extended to issuing arrest warrants or search warrants, I would say the clerk could not do that, could not be given that power and --"
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1701.463,1704.876,He couldn't he be designated an acting magistrate in absence of the --
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1704.876,1715.963,"Not without more -- not if he remained simply a clerk and was not given any additional status, any additional protections in office, that would simply be changed --"
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1715.963,1719.552,"(Voice Overlap) earlier, that’s right then that whole system in New Jersey."
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1719.552,1720.003,"Well, New Jersey is one of the --"
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1720.003,1721.567,(Voice Overlap)
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1721.567,1728.414,"New Jersey is one of the few states, I might say that does authorize its clerical personnel to issue arrest warrants."
1971.71-5445,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1732.422,1738.832,"New Jersey still goes as far as it used to, doesn’t it, to permit the clerk to actually to function as the magistrate in the absence --"
1971.71-5445,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1738.832,1746.999,"Yes, I believe they do, but of course the New Jersey statute with respect to the warrant procedures those quite far in number of respects."
1971.71-5445,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.303,1812.964,"I think you have consumed it all, but we'll see what the situation is Mr. Rezneck."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,1814.065,1820.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.918,1858.217,But the offense --
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,1858.217,1872.707,"The offense was under the ordinance called generally careless driving while drinking which is a phrase I use, but more specifically careless driving while his ability to drive is impaired by the use of alcohol or a drug."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1898.7,1904.564,In Tampa do you have to get a -- as a policeman do you have to get a warrant to issue a parking ticket?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,1904.564,1907.793,"No sir, that is one of distinguishing features."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.42,2023.269,What is there in Tampa?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2028.048,2041.531,"Then what he does, is he picks him back up and they call the paddywagon, Your Honor, and they take him down and they put him in drunk tank for approximately four hours if he is unable to manipulate himself what-so-ever."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.531,2044.881,"Well I know, that's not at issue here at all, is it?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2044.881,2045.518,No Sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2045.518,2049.062,Where do you get to decide on he would go on and keep on driving?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2049.062,2060.329,"Well, because appellant has argued and in his brief says, that we should give this man summons rather than arrest him on the street, because by arresting him on the street, what your are doing, the appellant says --"
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.329,2068.556,"I thought appellant’s position was that you couldn't get that warrant, unless you got it from a judicial officer."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2068.556,2071.452,"Yes sir, that is his issue."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.402,2089.224,Then why don't you give the summons when he gets out of tank?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2089.224,2090.362,Why can you not?
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2090.362,2091.453,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2091.453,2111.24,"Well sir, because once you physically place a person under custody, when a police office takes that man and puts him into custody that technically is an arrest, even though he doesn't say “You are under arrest” or if the man doesn't understand it."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.996,2117.202,"If I understand you correctly, this man was put in the tank --"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2117.202,2118.986,"No sir, I'm not saying that this particular man is put --"
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2118.986,2122.135,But didn't you say any drunken driver is put in the tank?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2122.135,2128.222,"I'm saying if he's so inebriated that he can't control himself, he's put in a drunk tank, if he is not, he is not put in the tank."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.222,2140.301,"If he is, and he's put in a tank, you say you go get a warrant from the deputy clerk and arrest him after that, right?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2140.301,2142.224,"No Sir, I'm saying --"
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2142.224,2146.824,"Well, you couldn't go, get the arrest warrant, while the man is laying on the street, do you?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2149.352,2151.128,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.721,2166.583,And then he never gets a warrant after that?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2166.583,2175.876,"No, Your Honor but he does, right up a complaint where he puts down the various factors that he has observed."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.257,2186.914,"Well, then the point is that what we're talking about is where it's not into policeman's presence, is that what we're talking about in this case?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2186.914,2191.001,I'm not saying that in this case because in this case we don't know from the record what it is.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2205.567,2211.877,"Well, restoring my Brother Marshal's questions, you know, what kind of cases is this applicable?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2240.139,2251.353,What you're saying is true unless the man is incarcerated post bail.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.243,2284.526,And there was no warrant at all?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2284.526,2286.995,"No, there was no warrant for that at all no sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.268,2294.444,Or as an original arrest --
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2294.444,2296.732,Or as an original arrest if it was not in officer's presence.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2296.732,2302.546,"Right , right."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2302.546,2307.876,"Incidentally, who's the marshal under, what officer is that, marshal?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2307.876,2309.862,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2309.862,2311.738,Is he a police officer --
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2311.738,2317.152,"168.04 which is the general statute, I think that you're referring to is two separable parts."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2327.545,2328.585,"Yeah, but who is the marshal now?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2328.585,2333.79,Now in Tampa we do not have a marshal.
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2340.031,2342.297,Well is a marshal a policeman wherever they have a marshal?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2342.297,2351.771,Yes sir but the general law which provides that runs throughout for all the municipalities of the state of Florida whether they be in a population of say 200 people.
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2358.864,2369.639,"Well, this statute then means that not only the clerk, but in the absence of the clerk and the mayor, then the police officer may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person complaining, is that right?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2369.639,2373.068,Yes sir that is true under the general law.
1971.71-5445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.111,2405.8,"But the clerk issued one here, didn't he?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2405.8,2407.733,But that's it.
1971.71-5445,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.872,2503.772,"That wouldn't affect the applicability of the statute to the other parts of Florida, would it?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2503.772,2512.43,"No sir, it would not but I felt in justice this should be pointed out to the Court and brought to the Court's attention that Tampa is moving in this direction and the clerks --"
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.43,2515.832,Do you mean abolished or renamed?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2515.832,2516.313,They will be certainly --
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.313,2520.201,Where I come from I have municipal court there.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2523.732,2524.33,No sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.624,2531.24,That's right?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2531.24,2531.7,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2706.754,2717.896,"Mr. Rezneck, if I were to be in this connection, do you agree with Mr. Rezneck that we have a final judgment in this case under 1257 of Title 28?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2717.896,2718.899,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2718.899,2719.616,You think you do?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2719.616,2720.267,I do.
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2720.267,2728.756,And you do so on the ground that this common-law writ of certiorari haven't followed a -- equates with a writ of prohibition or something of this kind?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2728.756,2738.601,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that would be sufficient to bring it up and the cause determined by Supreme Court of Florida in particular dealing with the issues that it would be classified as a final judgment."
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2738.601,2742.307,And that Mr. Shadwick may be acquitted in this case?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2742.307,2745.006,"Right, he could be, he could be."
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2764.588,2771.208,"Well, suppose it were motion to suppress evidence made in advance of trial, what happens in your system?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2774.838,2794.672,"Yes, the State of Florida -- the essential requirements of law, if the defendant feels that court has not performed within the essential requirements of law, he has a right to common-law writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court, from there he can take it to the District Court of Appeals and then to Supreme Court of Florida."
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2794.672,2801.206,Is this a handy state way to avoid our usual barrier of the finality of judgments?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2801.206,2802.447,"Yes sir, it is."
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2807.583,2811.42,I'll confess that I I for one am bothered by this issue in your case.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2814.222,2819.44,"Yes sir, I understand."
1971.71-5445,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2838.255,2839.344,Mr. Bee suppose --
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2839.344,2839.76,"Yes, sir --"
1971.71-5445,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.76,2853.375,"Mr. Shadwick didn't wanted to file a special writ of certiorari and had simply gone to -- gone to trial, would he at sometime during the trial proceedings have had an opportunity to raise the validity of the warrant as a part of those proceedings?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2853.375,2854.501,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.526,2897.586,Mr. Bee we're assuming that an attack is made on the search warrant in Florida.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2909.321,2921.34,I believe normal approach of attacking validity of a search warrant in an affidavit is that if the motion is filed and the judge denies --
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.34,2930.924,"In my hypothetical he is using the exact same proceeding he used in this case, is that possible, in Florida?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2930.924,2937.019,"I would – Your Honor that's a hard question to answer, but I think, I think it would be and the reason I say I think --"
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2937.019,2949.803,"Well, my question is if we rule with the petitioner in this case, then every preliminary motion, in any criminal case comes right straight up here, before the man is ever brought to trial?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2949.803,2962.323,"It could possibly very well do that way by common-law writ of certiorari if the appellant claims that the essential requirements of law have not been followed, then he can go by writ of certiorari and own up to this --"
1971.71-5445,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.323,2965.66,Like my brother Blackmun I got the problems too.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2965.66,2967.47,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.47,2985.892,"This is however an independent action, as I understand it under Florida law, equivalent or roughly similar at least to action for a declaratory judgment and an injection or for a pre-trail habeas corpus which is I think historically well known --"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2985.892,2987.44,Are you talking about the writ of certiorari?
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.44,2988.609,Yes.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2988.609,2988.853,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.853,2992.881,"And the final judgment and an independent action, isn't it?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,2992.881,2994.984,I wouldn't call it a final and independent.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3000.07,3004.411,"It's not part -- it's not part of the criminal prosecution, it's independent action --"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3004.411,3004.979,That's correct --
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3004.979,3008.897,Independently to test a provision under the law.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3008.897,3012.238,"Yes Your Honor, it's independent action."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.238,3016.706,"Equivalent as I say, at least similar to an action for a declaratory judgment, or an injunction."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3016.706,3018.533,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.533,3023.249,"Or for equivalent, in other ways to a pretrial habeas corpus?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3023.249,3028.668,It's another avenue of approach outside of the avenue of appeal and by error.
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3028.668,3031.393,You have declaratory judgment procedure in Florida?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3031.393,3032.731,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-5445,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3032.731,3035.742,Could this issue have been tested there?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3035.742,3040.012,"I believe not, I believe that would be more in the civil field."
1971.71-5445,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.384,3059.14,"Mr. Bee, was there a seizure as a result of the seizure of evidence, as a result of the arrest in this case?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3059.14,3063.309,"No, Your Honor, there is no question of seizure in this case to my knowledge."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3063.309,3072.961,"Well, does that mean Mr. Bee that if you lose up here, what you will do is go to the clerk's boss and get a new arrest warrant and start this prosecution all over again?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3072.961,3074.786,Would I go get another warrant for it?
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3074.786,3080.999,"If you lose here, on the ground of this arrest was invalid, then what you'd do with the case?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3080.999,3083.637,"Well, Your Honor, I would certainly not prosecute it."
1971.71-5445,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3088.301,3092.55,But you could -- the issue is whether you could?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3092.55,3094.392,What -- we could continue prosecution?
1971.71-5445,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3094.392,3094.981,Yes.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3094.981,3096.009,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3096.009,3104.046,"Just go to the magistrate now and get the same arrest warrant issued by the magistrate, wouldn't you, and arrest this man all over again."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3104.046,3104.715,"No, sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.715,3106.18,Why not?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3106.18,3107.348,We wouldn't rearrest him.
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3115.921,3117.962,Was he on bail or something?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3117.962,3120.66,"Yes, sir, originally he was out on bail as I understand."
1971.71-5445,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3120.66,3127.142,"Well, so the determination of this issue up here will have virtually nothing to do with his trial on the merits?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3127.142,3129.623,"Not on the merits, no sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3151.609,3168.002,"But if Mr. Rezneck should prevail here and this Court should simply hold that the matter of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, Florida could not constitutionally confer this power upon a deputy clerk."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3188.224,3192.868,"I am not, Your Honor, I am not sure that I follow exactly your question --"
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3192.868,3204.852,"All that's at issue here before us is the validity of Florida's law that confers upon this person, the power to issue an arrest warrant?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3204.852,3205.846,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3205.846,3239.809,"And if we hold that Mr. Rezneck is correct, and Florida acted unconstitutionally in conferring this power upon Deputy Clerk, it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the petitioner committed this offense and has nothing whatsoever to do with these trial, has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not he cannot -- after this Court's decision, be validly arrested under a warrant issue by a magistrate unless there is a statute limitations problem."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3239.809,3244.593,"It would have nothing to do with his trial, no sir, whatsoever this is true."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3244.593,3248.448,Nor with his guilt not with anything or is there any evidence that might come into that trial -- anything else.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3248.448,3250.32,That's true.
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3250.693,3271.602,"So why wouldn't you answer to my brother's White -- Rehnquist questions, yes we would go ahead presumably and have this man arrested and rearrested, if this arrest was invalid, have him rearrested and go to trial."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3276.461,3290.397,"Well, yes, of course we would proceed with the prosecution but not if this particular warrant type of situation is held unconstitutional, then we -- certainly wouldn't come back and use that same type of warrant to go out and arrest --"
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3290.397,3292.617,"No, but you would go before a judge and get a warrant."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3292.617,3301.814,"Yes sir, yes sir, it's correct."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3411.601,3417.168,"Well, could the legislature do that with the prosecuting attorney and all of his deputies?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3417.168,3417.555,"No, sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3417.555,3430.472,"Just saying, we know that they are his normal duties or be -- or the prosecute cases but we are going to give him this little sliver of judicial power and allow him to issue arrest warrants and even search warrants, could you do that?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3430.472,3431.462,"No, sir."
1971.71-5445,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.462,3432.294,Why not?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3432.294,3434.888,My answer to that is simply this.
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3471.728,3472.579,Or a policeman.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3472.579,3473.746,Or a policeman does not --
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3473.746,3481.285,"Well, if you -- new statute, you told me earlier in the absence of the judge and mayor or the mayor and the clerk, lets the policeman issued the warrant."
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3481.285,3483.121,"No, sir, we do not have that system."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3483.121,3484.308,But the statute says so.
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3484.308,3488.565,"Yes, sir, the statute says that, but the Special Acts do not in the city of Tampa."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3494.212,3498.97,"You mean in Tampa, if the mayor and clerk are absent then no one can issue it?"
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3498.97,3500.989,"No, we have many clerks."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3502.688,3504.654,What many clerks of the court?
1971.71-5445,1,24961,gerald_h_bee,,3504.654,3506.613,"There are many Deputy Clerks, yes, sir, Your Honor."
1971.71-5445,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3590.422,3591.562,"Thank you, Mr. Bee."
1971.71-5445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3599.463,3604.417,"Would you tell me, Mr. Rezneck, if you win a (Inaudible) victory for your client if you prevail?"
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3604.417,3610.401,"I think that's for the state of Florida, for the city of Tampa to decide, Your Honor, as to where they want to proceed from here."
1971.71-5445,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3610.401,3617.735,"Well, I know, -- if you win, what's to prevent them just from getting a proper arrest warrant?"
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3617.735,3620.545,"Well I think that's a decision that they will have to make, but --"
1971.71-5445,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3620.545,3623.361,But does not prevent them making it because you win.
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3623.361,3624.292,I believe that's correct.
1971.71-5445,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.292,3629.795,"We have got to assume if it's irrelevant at all, but they will do so, isn't that true?"
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3629.795,3632.298,I don't think we can assume one way or another.
1971.71-5445,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3632.298,3634.051,"They have the power, they have the power."
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3634.051,3639.584,I believe that they do provided that they comply with constitutional standards in how they do it.
1971.71-5445,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3671.429,3673.592,Was that a Federal Court of the state?
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3673.592,3685.555,"State, straight from a state court, yes and my understanding is that is the test in this Court for appellate jurisdiction under 1257 (2) and we would submit that we have met that."
1971.71-5445,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3731.694,3742.159,"Of course, in Mills, didn't the Court say that the ruling on the demur was for all practical purposes, a determination of a litigation that a remand was just going to result in a formality?"
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3742.159,3763.991,"The issues being raised by the defendant, I would suggest, that was respect to this particular issue that's before the Court here, and and with the constitutionality of Florida arrest procedure that there is nothing further to be done, there is nothing more to be said on that point and a further proceeding would not illuminate that point at all, and I would l think that that would meet the point that the Court was getting at in Mills, unless there is nothing further to be raise on that particular point."
1971.71-5445,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3763.991,3769.705,"But in Mills, they are talking about the merits and I think for to be on merits, where the merits were criminal prosecution not an abstract --"
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3769.705,3773.547,"Yes Your Honor, I understand there is that distinction but I do think that in terms of the issue --"
1971.71-5445,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3773.547,3783.835,"Mr. Rezneck, suppose in this case, when you filed your action they go and got a warrant from the Chief Judge of the Court, would you be here?"
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3783.835,3785.04,And had rearrested?
1971.71-5445,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3785.04,3786.451,Yes sir.
1971.71-5445,2,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,3786.451,3789.074,I would suppose that we would not be here then.
1971.71-5445,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3844.778,3846.352,"Thank you, Mr. Rezneck, thank you, Mr. Bee."
