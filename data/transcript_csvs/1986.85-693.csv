1986.85-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,40.558,"Do you pronounce your name ""Stare-ing""?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,40.558,41.993,"""Starring""."
1986.85-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,41.993,43.027,"""Starring"", okay."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,47.481,49.731,I'm not sure how they got there.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,309.333,312.618,"Mr. Staring, straighten out a couple of details for me."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,318.356,330.616,"There are none in this case, but there are other cross-claims in other cases not before the Court, not this identical case."
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,331.382,333.734,And it has nothing to do with this accident?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,333.734,337.536,"Yes, they arise from this accident."
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,337.536,338.036,I see.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,338.036,338.536,Yes.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,338.536,345.007,Is there a choice of law clause in the contracts between your client and Cheng Shin?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,345.007,348.91,We have no knowledge of that.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.91,352.029,Thank you.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,352.029,353.445,The record shows nothing as to it.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,458.132,463.017,Would you be making the same argument if the original Plaintiff had not settled?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,463.017,467.321,Yes.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,482.497,483.88,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,483.88,490.603,"But had it done so, we would be making the same argument."
1986.85-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.844,663.332,"Mr. Staring, do you concede that it was foreseeable that the valves would reach California?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,663.332,667.134,"No, I do not concede that it was foreseeable."
1986.85-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,671.669,679.774,"You argue that foreseeability alone is not enough, anyway."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,679.774,685.845,"--Yes, we argue that foreseeability alone is not enough."
1986.85-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,697.653,701.021,"By that what do you mean, that that should be the test?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,701.021,710.961,"No, but that that should not be the test and that that is the very most, the very most which could be shown by the record here."
1986.85-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.961,715.53,"You may as well give that away, because the California court found foreseeability."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,717.649,724.803,I don't ask this Court to review the facts as found by the California court.
1986.85-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.803,725.853,And they found foreseeability.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,725.853,726.921,On whatever record.
1986.85-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.921,727.488,Right.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,727.488,728.855,I don't know whether they found it.
1986.85-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,743.764,750.886,Do you think there has to be a different test for a component manufacturer than the primary manufacturer?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,750.886,757.274,I do not think that there's any different principle which applies.
1986.85-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.785,915.372,Where do you want to end the fog?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,941.339,952.695,--I wouldn't draw the distinction just on the basis of whether it was an ultimate manufacturer or an exporter.
1986.85-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.303,1032.48,"If I understand you, I have to be the one who sends the thing into the market."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1043.002,1045.621,"No, Justice Scalia, I do not contend that."
1986.85-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.986,1071.836,"Well, now you're getting foggy."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1093.018,1100.422,I must beg off any response on criminal law.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.477,1116.964,"Well, does the record show what percentage of Cheng Shin's... is that the name, Cheng Shin?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1116.964,1117.747,Cheng Shin.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.747,1120.849,Cheng Shin's valves are purchased from your client?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1120.849,1122.701,It does not show it.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.701,1129.355,So that it does show that Cheng Shin bought from other suppliers?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1129.355,1129.672,Yes.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.672,1135.259,So your client just supplied part of the demand--
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1135.259,1136.126,That's right.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.126,1137.128,--for that particular company?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1137.128,1137.595,That's right.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.595,1145.132,And so some of his valves might have gone to California and perhaps none of them did?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1145.132,1145.732,Exactly.
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.772,1156.689,"We do know there were quite a few, don't we?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1161.41,1164.778,"--We don't know that from this record, no."
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.778,1165.428,Not their valves.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1165.428,1166.897,Beg your pardon?
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.897,1168.564,There were that many tires sold.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1168.564,1170.016,"Tires, I think."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.016,1172.818,And didn't they all have your client's valves?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1172.818,1174.068,"No, we don't know the number of valves."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.068,1175.42,Wouldn't your client know that?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1175.42,1183.657,"No, because the component manufacturer puts his valves in inventory, he ships them to the ultimate manufacturer, they go through his inventory."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.073,1187.692,He must have some idea what's going to happen to those.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1194.096,1209.188,"I think that the realistic situation in an industrial situation of this sort is a little different, and that there are more likely to be supply contracts and shipments from one country to another under supply contracts, rather than door to door salesmen."
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1209.188,1216.211,"Well, doesn't the record show an investigation and finding of your valves in California?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1216.211,1234.673,The record contains affidavits in which a lawyer in Sacramento has said that he identified quite a number of our valves on tires in California.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1234.673,1236.875,Is that improper material in the record?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1236.875,1238.608,"Yes, we think so."
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1251.032,1259.555,"I'm not sure about great reliance, but does the record show the presence of your valves in the state of California?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1259.555,1268.577,The record shows that valves identified as ours have been found in the state of California in the year 1983.
1986.85-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1272.298,1272.865,That's my impression.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1272.865,1273.831,"That's right, 1983."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.926,1294.061,"Well, if you find the registered agent today you could serve him today, couldn't you?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1297.346,1307.702,"--Well, that is not, however, at the heart of the stream of commerce doctrine as we understand it."
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.054,1342.589,"Well, your client at least knew that Cheng Shin's tires were being sold in the United States?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1342.589,1346.207,--The record shows that we were told that at some time.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.207,1352.445,"Yes, and the only thing... and you knew that there's a chance then that some of your valves would get to California."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1361.301,1377.66,"It must be taken... yes, it must be taken that we had a mere... an awareness of a mere likelihood, and that is all, a mere likelihood at most that some valve of ours might find its way to California."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.951,1388.251,Unlikely?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1399.759,1401.628,"Well, the evidence of that--"
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.628,1407.162,Wasn't there a sampling of one county and about half of the valves there came from your client?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1407.162,1411.816,"--There was an affidavit showing, as I said, that in 1983--"
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.816,1412.599,I understand.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1412.599,1419.689,"--there were a number of valves found which were identified as Asahi's, tentatively by the way."
1986.85-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.045,1458.63,"Well, I don't see where you'd get out on a lack of jurisdiction."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1476.342,1479.961,"I agree with you, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.083,1495.32,"Well, don't you have a right to test... supposing you think this affidavit is foggy or you think it doesn't say as much as you think it ought to."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1498.022,1500.224,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1986.85-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.224,1502.641,And did you choose to avail yourself in this case?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1502.641,1503.343,And we did not do it.
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1521.388,1528.541,"But Mr. Staring, isn't the fogginess partly due to the fact that the affidavit of Asahi's president is perhaps not as detailed as it might have been?"
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1543.701,1546.086,"No, I think, Justice Stevens, that you're correct."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.584,1594.784,"Well, let me ask you this question."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1619.616,1624.603,"I think there would not, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.603,1625.953,So there doesn't have to be fogginess.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1629.59,1632.792,"If you have that situation, yes."
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.344,1654.122,So that would be the same if your client knew that they supplied 100 percent of the requirements of the tire manufacturer and they knew that every tire that that manufacturer sent into California had your valve in it?
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1660.193,1667.763,"--If I may repeat it to be sure I understand it, this is that we have knowledge we supply all the valves to Cheng Shin--"
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.763,1668.247,Yes.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1668.247,1671.632,--and we have knowledge that they ship their tires with our valves into California.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.632,1674.501,And that every tire that they ship to California has your valve in it.
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1674.501,1675.036,All right.
1986.85-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.022,1685.474,"Well, that's the same question, though, that Justice Stevens asked you."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1685.474,1691.212,But there is another... I do not concede there is jurisdiction because we have to look at other possibilities.
1986.85-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.42,1733.372,"Well, maybe that's a defense on the merits, that you just did exactly perform your contract."
1986.85-693,0,26020,graydon_s_staring,,1743.68,1761.141,"The difficulty as a practical matter with that, Justice Stevens, is that you don't know what the ultimate manufacturer is going to do or how he's going to do it, what products he's going to put it into and what products he's going to say it should be used on, a bicycle or a high speed motorcycle."
1986.85-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.428,1792.594,"Thank you, Mr. Staring."
1986.85-693,1,39474,ronald_r_haven,,1794.228,1797.915,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, members of the Court:"
1986.85-693,2,26020,graydon_s_staring,,3443.201,3447.789,"Just a few seconds of it, if I may make one final observation."
1986.85-693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.28,3487.264,"Thank you, Mr. Staring."
