1979.78-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.193,We will hear arguments next in National Labor Relations Board v. Yeshiva University and a consolidated case.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,64.675,68.342,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.539,129.744,"It could be both, couldn't it?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,129.744,135.429,"They could be both, and that is why I said merely."
1979.78-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.513,145.539,Right.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,145.539,176.025,"Yeshiva University is a private educational institution chartered by the State of New York, facilities located on four campuses in New York City, has approximately 2,500 full and part-time students that attend schools involved in this proceeding, and those schools have approximately 209 full-time and 150 part-time faculty members."
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.723,315.356,"Mr. Come, does it vary somewhat among the schools?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,315.356,329.487,"It does vary to some extent, but in general this is the picture and the picture that the Board found is typical of most other universities and colleges."
1979.78-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.487,336.627,"When you say ""their own curriculum,"" you mean the curriculum that the faculty teaches the students, I take it?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,336.627,340.202,That is correct.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.027,387.497,"That is, each faculty member with respect to his own course and his own students?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,387.497,387.887,That is correct.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.887,389.848,But that alone didn't make them managerial.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,389.848,391.054,That did not.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.513,592.098,"Of course, the real difficulty in this case is more fundamental, isn't it, Mr. Come?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,613.317,615.096,That presents a --
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,615.096,618.185,"I mean that is the difficult problem, the fundamental problem."
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,618.185,620.408,"Well, that presents a problem."
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.4,654.067,"Well, originally a college, as the Latin word implies, collegium, was a collection of scholars who went to Oxford or Cambridge or Bologna or Heidelberg or Paris and scholars then came -- students then came to learn from them and the faculty were the university, they were the college, that was it."
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,654.067,656.145,There is no question about that.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,671.539,675.983,"One way, upwards or downwards, but I agree that it has come a long way."
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,675.983,679.636,-- is the error of the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.092,725.691,"We may both agree that the present-day university is not like Kings College in Cambridge originally was, but can't we also agree that Yeshiva University is not like General Motors either?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,725.691,728.315,It is not like General Motors.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.597,729.837,Or Chrysler.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,729.837,735.086,Or Chrysler -- I'm not so sure that that is so good.
1979.78-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,754.064,756.346,They give them the title of supervisor.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,757.73,763.935,"Well, it helps but the title, of course, is not necessarily decisive."
1979.78-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,763.935,774.577,"Mr. Come, in an industrial setting do they let them have a voice in the selection of their supervisors?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,774.577,789.966,"Well, I would say that it is not unusual to at least get recommendations."
1979.78-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.244,828.664,"When Congress passed this legislation, do you think they gave any thought one way or the other as to whether faculty members of a college were to be included Is there any evidence that Congress thought about it at all?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,828.664,833.286,"Well, certainly at the time they passed the Wagner Act, probably not."
1979.78-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,851.183,860.129,But then aren't you asking us to decide what Congress would have thought about it if they had given it any thought one way or the other?
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,860.129,868.562,"Well, that is not an unfamiliar problem in statutory interpretation that this Court has to face."
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.884,961.218,"The first assertion of jurisdiction had to do with people who were concededly employees, janitors and the like, wasn't it?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,961.218,963.877,"I believe that is right, librarians and maintenance --"
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,963.877,964.958,"The Cornell case, in other words."
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,964.958,966.304,The Cornell case.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,967.507,968.627,It did not have to do with faculty.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,968.627,976.398,"No, it did not have to do with faculty."
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.398,981.119,"Since I have already interrupted you, in this case does the bargaining unit include department heads?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,981.119,989.248,The bargaining unit did include department heads.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.214,1015.407,That would still be open?
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1015.407,1016.23,That is correct.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.372,1025.675,"The bargaining unit did not include deans, did it?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1025.675,1027.223,It did not include deans.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1035.141,1040.308,"Well, deans generally are elected by their colleagues, aren't they?"
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1040.308,1040.852,They are --
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1040.852,1041.791,Or I suppose they are appointed by the --
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1041.791,1044.907,They are appointed by the president.
1979.78-857,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1044.907,1046.733,On the recommendation of the faculty.
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1046.733,1047.54,Yes.
1979.78-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.54,1058.168,"Mr. Come, one thing that struck me about the Court of Appeals opinion was the frequency with which it noted that the administration simply went along with the faculty."
1979.78-857,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1065.376,1091.125,"Well, we submit that the fact that the administration chooses to accord great deference and respect to the judgment of its faculty does not indicate that the faculty is acting as management representatives when they give their advice."
1979.78-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1149.844,1151.849,Mr. Shechtman.
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1151.849,1154.372,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-857,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.068,1256.889,Did both of those cases involve what are now referred to in the briefs as mature universities?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1256.889,1257.813,I would believe so.
1979.78-857,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1268.93,1270.517,And they weren't proprietary or --
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1270.517,1271.308,"No, they are not."
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.564,1284.371,"Mr. Shechtman, I take it that the Board thought it critical to find that the faculty operated in its own interests rather than that of the employer?"
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1284.371,1287.549,I think that is the single critical inquiry here.
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.549,1288.85,"You were about to get to that, I suppose?"
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1288.85,1290.091,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.091,1302.217,"Could you tell me, give me an example that you can find in this record of this faculty operating in its own interest rather than of the employer."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1302.217,1311.202,"I think in answer to that question, it requires a distinction between their influence rather than their authority and --"
1979.78-857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.202,1318.372,Is there some place I can read in the record the evidence to support the Board's conclusion that the faculty operated in its --
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1318.372,1322.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.682,1324.284,Do you in your brief give record cites in that?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1324.284,1329.683,"Yes, Your Honor, in the last point in our brief we make repeated references thereto."
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.015,1365.43,"Well, that isn't quite responsive to my question."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1373.627,1375.355,I think they are in the interests of --
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.355,1377.199,I take it that is the critical point.
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1377.199,1381.666,"I believe so, and it is in the interest of the pursuit of their own professional excellence."
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.866,1396.271,"But you wouldn't say that it was not the interest of the university, would you?"
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1396.271,1396.411,No.
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.581,1411.863,"But if the university hires somebody to make recommendations to it, isn't the faculty charged with making recommendations in the interests of the university?"
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1420.383,1429.977,"It would be true with the lawyer, doctor or faculty member, with any professional who must make a decision about how to treat a patient, who to appeal a case, how to teach a course."
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.152,1444.564,"I am not interested in lawyers or doctors, I am interested in these professors."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1457.906,1458.122,I think --
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.122,1470.15,"Surely, I can't believe that there is evidence in this record that these committees are free to disregard in making the recommendations, are expected to disregard the interests of the university."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1470.15,1471.524,I am not suggesting that.
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.886,1480.565,That is a completely different point.
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1480.565,1481.271,I understand.
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.271,1486.661,"Well, let's stick to the point we are talking about, whether they act in their interests or that of the university --"
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1486.661,1487.569,They would act --
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.569,1490.276,-- which is the critical question.
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1490.276,1493.091,"If they possess the authority, Your Honor, I must respectfully differ."
1979.78-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.409,1504.677,They make recommendations.
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1525.028,1525.982,I am not saying that at all.
1979.78-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1586.277,1590.421,Does the record show who has authority to engage professions?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1590.421,1591.739,"Only the president, Your Honor."
1979.78-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1591.739,1592.575,Only the president?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1592.575,1602.823,"That is correct, with an independent review by the vice president for academic affairs after interviewing by the dean and often in some cases at least with some origination from the faculty."
1979.78-857,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1602.823,1612.286,Is there any evidence in the record to suggest that the president has ever hired anyone without the approval of the faculty committee?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1612.286,1621.952,There is evidence in the record to show that certain faculty or faculty committees have not considered or acted on each person appointed by the president.
1979.78-857,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1621.952,1623.653,What about granting tenure?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1623.653,1626.13,The tenure decision is made by the Board of Trustees.
1979.78-857,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1626.13,1628.941,Only on the recommendation of the faculty?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1628.941,1645.829,There are cases in the record here that show that certain faculty who were recommended for tenure were never considered by the Board of Trustees or the president because the dean refused to pass up the recommendation under his own choice.
1979.78-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.829,1660.705,"Well, certainly in making tenure recommendations, the university must have some standards and expects the faculty to live up to the university standards rather than to serve the faculty's own parochial interests."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1660.705,1661.578,The standards that the faculty --
1979.78-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.578,1663.019,Is that right or not?
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1663.019,1674.275,"That is correct, but the faculty's interest in those cases would be really again within precisely their professional expertise and competence, not in the expertise of managerial and --"
1979.78-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.275,1686.001,"Furthermore, even if the faculty doesn't have authority and even if the president has the final authority, that is true in the industrial establishment, foremen and admitted supervisors often don't have final authority."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1689.98,1704.039,"That is correct here, but the authority here is instead based on again an understanding of the professional identity and the protection they are afforded, the coverage under the act they are afforded as professional employees."
1979.78-857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.27,1748.93,"Your time is expired, Mr. Shechtman."
1979.78-857,1,40470,ronald_h_shechtman,,1748.93,1756.906,Thank you.
1979.78-857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.906,1758.733,Mr. Frankel.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1758.733,1762.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.84,1989.848,"On the other hand, Mr. Frankel, I wouldn't suppose that the university would so regularly follow faculty recommendations if it thought the faculty was acting contrary to the interests of the university."
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1989.848,2009.779,"Mr. Justice, I think that is right but, of course, one of the central issues -- and now we are told it is the central issue on which there is disagreement between the two sides -- is whether the faculty at Yeshiva or at similar universities does not act in the interests of the university."
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.779,2013.752,The Board concluded that the faculty operated in its own interest.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2013.752,2018.638,"Yes, it did, Your Honor, and it concluded that without --"
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.638,2020.386,"And you don't agree with that, do you?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2020.386,2022.073,"No, I very seriously disagree with it."
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.073,2033.378,"If you did, I take it if you were right, the Board would conclude otherwise, its bottom line would be different."
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2033.378,2042.029,"I think if the Board explained to us exactly what it meant, we might know better how to change its mind."
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.029,2055.775,"But if the Board agreed with you that the faculty does indeed act on behalf of the university, it would not hold the faculty to be employees rather than managers?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2055.775,2058.295,"I would hope so, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2407.001,2420.478,"Mr. Frankel, before you do, the Board did make that finding about this university and the Court of Appeals didn't agree, isn't that right?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2420.478,2424.287,"Your Honor, it is right that the Board said those words."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.806,2436.089,It said those words?
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2436.089,2436.853,Yes.
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.853,2443.261,"And if you will let me call it a finding just for a moment, I will go ahead."
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2468.836,2483.623,"Your Honor, I think the decision of the Court of Appeals merits the respect that its inherent cogency and persuasiveness imports and not more."
1979.78-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.864,2538.135,"Mr. Frankel, didn't this Court in Pittsburgh Steamship Company say that we don't sit in the same posture in reviewing the Board's findings as the Court of Appeals does, that we must give certain deference to the Court of Appeals and that one Court of Appeals might find one way and one might find another and each might be upheld by this Court?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2538.135,2543.811,"Your Honor, that is possible, depending on the nature of the case."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.976,2575.409,"Well, isn't that what Universal Camera stands for to some extent at least."
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2575.409,2575.994,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2575.994,2578.068,-- and what cases since then have said?
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2578.068,2579.269,"I think so, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.269,2590.578,"Didn't Universal Camera say unless we can fit it into one of two exceptions of the Universal Camera principle, we can't go beyond that?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2590.578,2591.092,That's right.
1979.78-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.092,2592.295,And that includes --
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2592.295,2597.505,But what I am saying is that this isn't a Universal Camera case.
1979.78-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2663.789,2678.602,"Are you saying, Mr. Frankel, that this is a matter of whether the court simply drew different legal conclusions from the findings of fact of the Board, different --"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2678.602,2678.924,Yes --
1979.78-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.924,2681.352,-- different legal conclusions from the Board?
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2681.352,2695.942,This is where the court made a different decision on a question of law from facts which as they come to this Court are undisputed.
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2711.523,2716.685,Can I just get that a little more precisely because I am interested in what is fact and what is law here.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2727.382,2727.954,"Your Honor, I would say that --"
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2727.954,2735.105,Because they squarely say we find that the faculty's own interest was served on page 68a that you called our attention to.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2735.105,2747.139,"I would say that the Board there is giving a conclusion which, however you try to characterize it, has no basis in the record."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2757.773,2758.078,I see.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2758.078,2776.06,"-- in order to define supervisory and they are saying these people are not supervisors under 211 because although they do these various things that are the kinds of things supervisors do, they do them in their own interests somehow and not in the interests of the employer."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.418,2836.686,"Suppose they made a recommendation on the salaries to be paid to starting professors, would that be in their interest or in the university's interest?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2836.686,2846.926,"Insofar as they were not themselves starting professors, which by definition they would not be, then I think it would be in the university's interest."
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2846.926,2851.071,I suppose the starting professor's salary level would have an impact on their own though.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2851.071,2852.891,This would affect their interests.
1979.78-857,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2852.891,2853.086,Yes.
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2853.086,2877.253,"There is no question at some point when the chairman of the manufacturing company makes a recommendation to the board that they go into a certain line of endeavor that he thinks is going to be very profitable, and he has stock options that will not be diminished in his view by that course of action, he is furthering his own interests as well."
1979.78-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2954.694,2964.255,"Mr. Frankel, going back to the University of Bologna, about a thousand years ago, would it be fair to say that what was good for the faculty was good for the university and vice versa?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2967.433,2976.904,"I think in general that -- it is prior to this act, of course, but I would say in general that would have been true."
1979.78-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2993.307,2997.14,"Well, that is consistent with the idea that the university is the faculty, isn't it?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,2997.14,2999.381,"It is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-857,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.381,3028.293,"Mr. Frankel, isn't it possible that the Board could correctly reach one result with respect to Columbia University and another result with respect to a law school which is the seventh proprietary school in a large metropolitan area where each faculty member simply comes in and bargains with the president over what his salary is going to do, and there aren't any faculty committees to recommend anything?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3028.293,3044.619,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is possible and I would suggest that this record illustrates in a couple of ways the kind of spectrum -- which is not my word but that of the National Educational Association in its amicus brief -- alone which faculties fall."
1979.78-857,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3117.641,3141.606,"Mr. Frankel, in our review of what the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit did in this case, does the statement in Universal Camera have any application, whether on the record as a whole as substantial evidence as to support agency findings on the question which Congress has placed in the keeping of the Courts of Appeal?"
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3153.398,3166.188,"It has relevance, Mr. Justice Brennan, to this degree -- which I must answer somewhat hypothetically -- insofar as these words that Mr. Justice White and I conversed about, in their own interests."
1979.78-857,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3220.641,3229.42,"Well, what I was thinking wasn't whether the Court of Appeals had misapplied Universal Camera."
1979.78-857,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3251.98,3272.618,"Well, I have frankly, Mr. Justice Brennan, tended to think the answer is probably no, because I don't think that the Court of Appeals overturned agency fact finding in the sense that I understand Universal Camera to be concerned with."
1979.78-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3542.066,3553.644,"Mr. Come, you have about two minutes left."
1979.78-857,3,37058,norton_j_come,,3553.644,3564.987,I would like to address myself to this concept in the interest of the university.
1979.78-857,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.612,3577.801,I suppose you would say that was a finding of fact for the Board or not?
1979.78-857,3,37058,norton_j_come,,3577.801,3593.093,That is a legal conclusion by the Board which means not that the faculty is necessarily opposed to the interests of the university but --
1979.78-857,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3593.093,3603.538,"But in a Court of Appeals reviewing the Board's conclusion that the faculty acts in its own interests rather than the university, would that be a finding subject to the substantial evidence test?"
1979.78-857,3,37058,norton_j_come,,3603.538,3611.693,"No, I think that the Court of Appeals misconceived the legal significance of that term."
1979.78-857,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.692,3709.33,"Are you saying, Mr. Come, that what is good for the faculty is good for the university and vice versa, the question that I tossed to Mr. Frankel?"
1979.78-857,3,37058,norton_j_come,,3709.33,3711.854,"Well, it may not be always."
1979.78-857,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3715.227,3718.029,"If it doubled their salaries, it might not be."
1979.78-857,3,37058,norton_j_come,,3718.134,3719.576,"Well, it might not be or --"
1979.78-857,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3719.576,3722.113,Or it might be.
1979.78-857,3,37058,norton_j_come,,3722.113,3742.713,Let us assume you have a language department that decides that it would be the strongest department and the professors there and the students would get the best benefit from giving tenure to a professor of Greek.
1979.78-857,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3816.901,3817.525,"Thank you, gentlemen."
