1966.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.548,"Number 42, Switzerland Cheese Association, Incorporated et al., petitioners versus E. Horne's Market, Incorporated."
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,31.976,37.718,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,364.336,393.724,"Well, in reality, does this case involve anything more than the question as to whether this Court is going to review and perhaps overrule a decision of the United States District Court on a motion for summary judgment that the case is not right for summary disposition that there is a genuine issue, a fact which the Court wants to try out."
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,396.144,397.975,"May it please, Your Honor."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,418.036,419.437,"Well, I am not asking you that."
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,488.048,490.452,"Your Honor, I'm afraid I have to disagree."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,490.452,492.591,Why?
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,492.591,505.738,The question involved here as far as we are concerned is a question of law to which in our original motion for summary judgment we raised a legal proposition.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,528.974,530.413,But that means -- that assumes --
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,530.413,532.091,That's not a question of fact.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,532.091,543.374,"Well, it's not question -- I don't mean to call it a question of law because that assumes that in this particular case, there is a deceptive use of a trademark."
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,543.374,543.906,Right.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,543.906,582.88,"Now, it's quite -- the Court -- the District Court wrote no opinion made no findings than after most of the summary judgments as I understand the law whether it's quite possible that the District Court thought that that was not satisfied on the basis of the affidavits that the respondents use of its mark, otherwise deceptive, and that they wouldn't have a full trial and just because you propose an issue of law in the District Court it does not follow, does it, that the District Court had to decide that issue of law?"
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,582.88,586.254,The District Court conceded that it was a matter of law.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,586.254,590.615,Rather that -- it wrote no opinion and made no findings.
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,590.615,590.862,Sorry?
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,590.862,592.878,It wrote no opinion and made no findings.
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,604.682,605.455,Correct.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,605.455,618.099,"Now, do you know of any other -- of any case on the books other than the decision of Judge Frank I think is and the Second Circuit?"
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,618.099,628.811,"Oh, yes, the leading case is Federal Glass Company v. Loshin which has been dealt with at great length in our brief that the Circuit Judge Learned Hand."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,639.661,639.808,"Well, we're not trying --"
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,639.808,649.826,"And the judge said, it denies it and then he had said as a matter of law you are not entitled to your remedy to your injunction and that's exactly is the present case."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,649.956,665.82,Was there a ruling to the effect that assume that the issue of this trademark is deceptive by the respondent and you are not entitled to relief?
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,665.82,671.772,I think there was a ruling that I am not entitled to relief as a matter of law.
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,671.898,674.934,"Well, you're not entitled to relief, that's clear, isn't it?"
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,681.571,685.837,"Well, we say it isn't abstract because we have a statute and the treaty."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,685.837,687.592,But the Court don't have to agree with you.
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,695.665,696.816,Right but it didn't --
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,696.816,703.89,But you didn't move after -- did you or did you not after the denial of the motion for summary judgment.
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,709.8,713.327,"No, Your Honor but we construed this as a final judgment."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,713.327,714.011,Sir?
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,714.011,721.964,We construed this order which denied the permanent injunction as a final judgment and if I may explain to you I --
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,721.964,726.154,"As far as I am concerned, there's a very real question on that."
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,726.154,736.424,"Now, Your Honor, my question -- why we go to the trouble of petitioning for a writ instead of going back to the District Court in trying the case."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,790.097,796.879,That it seems to me that what you're seeking is something that may be unknown to our system of law.
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,796.879,797.341,"No, Your Honor."
1966.42,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,797.341,819.836,That is to say I don't see how a court can give you an injunction except in terms of a fact of -- facts of particular cases and it seems to me that what the District Court did here was may have been to say that I am not satisfied as to the facts of this particular case and you got to go to the trial.
1966.42,0,21641,david_toren,,846.872,855.595,"Your Honor, as far as I am concerned the language of the statute is so plain and clear it permits for one interpretation only."
1966.42,1,26803,harold_e_cole,,2107.977,2117.406,Mr. Chief Justice and this Honorable Court.
1966.42,2,21641,david_toren,,3364.72,3367.765,Mr. Chief Justice may I request some additional time?
1966.42,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3367.765,3367.981,No.
1966.42,2,21641,david_toren,,3374.593,3376.519,Thank you.
