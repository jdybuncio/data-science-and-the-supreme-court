1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.588,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 71-5103, Morrissey and Booher against Brewer."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,22.766,26.95,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,27.38,51.236,"Before you proceed, counsel, let me mention one other factor that Mr. Justice Marshall is unavoidably absent this morning but he will participate in the cases to be heard today on the basis of the files, records, briefs and the recording of the oral argument."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,51.236,51.785,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.636,259.571,"Mr. Brittin, I -- as I understand the record, the parole officer had talked to Morrissey, he -- had he not?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,259.571,270.207,"I believe you are correct, Your Honor, that he had talked to Morrissey in jail at the time he had been arrested after the -- the parole agent got the warrant for his arrest for parole violation."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.207,277.397,"And as I understand respondent's contention, Morrissey pretty well admitted the charges against him."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,277.397,291.468,"You are correct in saying that it is respondent's contention, if I understand his contention -- actually I don't wish to speak for him but I do believe that he contends that Morrissey admitted at that time that he violated the conditions of this parole."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.708,315.818,How about the automobile?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,315.818,317.438,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,317.438,317.482,How about the automobile?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,317.482,318.684,The automobile?
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.681,326.264,Was that -- was that in violation or not?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,326.264,335.271,I don't think that the parole agreement specifically required or prohibited him from doing that but I think that -- that act was probably in violation of his parole.
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.271,336.881,So he admitted that one act anyway.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,336.881,338.527,"He admitted the act, that's right, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.092,347.7,So there's no dispute about the facts on that particular --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,347.7,349.029,About the automobile?
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.289,356.093,And it was just a question of -- of whether or not that should amount to a violation of the parole.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,356.093,357.207,That's right and whether or not that --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.207,360.96,But even if -- that even if there was a violation of whether the parole should be revoked.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,360.96,362.532,That's right.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,435.908,436.324,Do you incurred --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,436.324,436.671,It is not alleged --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,436.671,440.504,"-- the automobile purchase in that category, Mr. Brittin?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,440.504,443.623,I don't believe the -- the purchase of an automobile --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.623,446.479,With -- in under a false name?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,446.479,452.269,"I don't believe that that would be -- that would necessarily constitute a crime, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,452.269,452.493,Would it --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,452.493,453.315,Certainly deception --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,453.315,462.251,-- would it constitute -- I thought you would -- indicated to Justice White that that would be a basis for revoking parole.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,462.251,474.307,"I -- I think I indicated to him that -- that if proven, that fact would constitute an act which might form the basis of a revocation of parole."
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,475.036,480.316,"If it's admitted, if it's admitted then why do you need proof?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,488.104,518.246,"I think there's a great difference, Your Honor, because the only evidence in this record and I think the only evidence that there is at all whether inside or outside of the record is with respect to what the statements that the -- that the parolee made to his parole agent while he was in custody, and I don't believe that -- that the board of parole or anyone else should rely solely upon those statements when submitted to the board of parole in written form to -- as a basis for a parole revocation."
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,564.635,572.784,"That statement at least with respect to Morrissey appears on page 65 of the appendix, does it not?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,572.784,573.286,"I think that is correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.286,575.916,Is that what you're talking about?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,578.773,579.091,There is.
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.131,582.15,Page 100?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,586.26,586.352,In fact the --
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.352,588.337,-- both of these petitioners signed?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,588.337,591.813,In fact the one at page 100 is a form of parole agreement --
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,591.813,591.97,Right.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,591.97,593.951,-- that was submitted to the District Court.
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,614.375,618.955,And this is the -- presumably what each one of these petitioners --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,618.955,620.205,"Presumably, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.205,628.51,-- signed and then I suppose with respect to individual parolees that other conditions maybe added that are -- been all about.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,628.51,632.307,"I've -- I've -- you may be correct, Your Honor, except that I do not know that any condition --"
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.307,632.579,Record that he's talking about.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,632.579,635.596,-- (Voice Overlap) conditions were added in either of these cases.
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.596,635.709,And he --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.709,648.292,Do you -- do you think that the parole officer's conversation was that these parolees gave -- at least established a probable cause to believe that a violation had occurred?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,648.292,654.023,I think that they may well have established probable cause to --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.023,661.728,"Well, then -- are you -- you don't object to the fact that if having found out what he found out, the parole officer could arrest them and detain them."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,661.728,664.019,"No, I don't object to that, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.019,672.155,And so that arrest and detention pending a hearing would be satisfactory as far as you are concerned.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,672.155,675.036,"So far as I'm concerned in this case, Your Honor, that would be satisfactory."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.621,683.304,Well let's just assume --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,683.304,683.546,-- years.
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.546,695.093,"-- I'm not saying this is -- this kind of a case, but let's just assume that there was no need because of the admissions of a series of events, acts and you call them technical violations if you want to."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,707.442,711.429,Assuming that facts have been established and I would maintain that those facts should be established --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.429,712.026,That's all right.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,712.026,712.598,-- by hearing.
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.556,725.67,"Well, you wouldn't if -- I suppose if you've got a man, a probationer, for example, before a court had -- in the court and the judge said, ""Did you do these things?"""
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,727.671,732.677,"No, I wouldn't object to that and I wouldn't -- I don't think I would object to it if the parole board would call the parolee --"
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.677,732.725,Yes.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,732.725,749.043,-- and -- and give him a hearing what you're talking about when you're talking about probation or being before the Court is what I'm talking about a parolee being before the parole board and having a chance to admit or deny the allegations to -- to present evidence on his own behalf --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.043,752.924,But this will be after -- after he'd been arrested and --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,752.924,753.449,After he had been --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.449,753.665,-- and incarcerated.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,753.665,760.011,-- arrested and -- and incarcerated and if that time is a reasonable time that I -- is not what I'm talking about in this case.
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.011,777.142,"So if the parole board -- if he is returned to jail and then the parole board calls him before them and he has an opportunity to say yes or no or to say whatever he wants to, that's enough."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,777.142,785.059,If he has an opportunity to admit or deny the allegations to confront and cross-examine the witnesses who've kept -- who may offer evidence in his --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.059,786.995,That is -- that is if he denies them.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,786.995,788.153,If he denies them.
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,806.345,815.753,"Mr. Brittin, did the parole board hear after your client had been returned to prison, interview him with respect to the alleged parole violation?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,815.753,819.527,"I think that they did interview him and that word is very critical, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.012,829.181,How would you distinguish between what was done and what you think ought to have been done in the way of a hearing?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,829.181,835.779,"Very frankly, Your Honor, I was unaware until the respondents filed their brief herein that there was any such interview at all."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.488,838.859,In your brief?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,838.859,841.087,-- that is in the respondent's brief.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.944,877.418,"Well, how long after the -- the arrest on parole violation was this interview process held?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,877.418,877.616,From --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.616,878.251,Do I correctly --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,878.251,878.37,-- respondents --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,878.37,880.97,-- remember that it was about 29 or 30 days something?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,880.97,886.215,"From respondent's brief, I -- I know that it was not more than two months after the revocation."
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,914.88,921.043,So where do you think he should be between the time he is arrested for the parole violation and the time of the hearing?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,924.398,937.489,I think if he is -- if there's evidence that his presence in society as any other person that as a parolee would be dangerous to society that he -- I do not object to his incarceration.
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.489,943.559,"Well, you said if he -- you said he -- he could be arrested that there's probable cause to believe that he had violated his parole."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,950.09,955.075,"No, I -- I -- the point I was trying to make, Your Honor, is that if this person was a dangerous person, I -- I think --"
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.075,955.144,Well --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,955.144,959.766,-- that he should be incarcerated pending the -- if there's probable cause to believe (Voice Overlap) --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.766,965.094,Unless there's some finding that he's dangerous he must be -- he has to be released after bail.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,965.094,968.101,"No, I don't -- I really don't think that's important."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.101,971.984,"Well, he was rather held in the city jail and in some jails --"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,971.984,972.122,Well --
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.122,974.316,(Voice Overlap) in prison?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,974.316,977.613,I think that the hearing should be held within a short time.
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.263,1011.972,"You're not intending here that he's entitled to counsel at this hearing, are you?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1011.972,1031.875,"I think that once it is determined that a petitioner is entitled to a hearing, prior to revocation of his parole and considering the -- the substantial interest he has in his continued liberty, that there is authority for this Court to hold that he is entitled to counsel at such a hearing."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.875,1037.115,"Well, you point in -- in this proceeding that he is -- he was entitled to counsel as well as to a hearing?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1037.115,1044.348,"The issues in this case are -- are, by the record, limited to the right to hearing and do not include the question of the right to counsel."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1150.808,1159.867,"Mr. Brittin, would you contend that a hearing is also required when the parole board sits to make a determination as to whether parole should be granted or not?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1159.867,1161.217,"No, I would not, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.217,1171.776,Isn't that an equally important stage in the criminal proceeding or doesn't that equally affect the substantial rights of the defendant?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1171.776,1176.773,It does -- I'm -- you're correct that it does affect his interest.
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.14,1210.297,The question is --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1210.297,1211.372,After --
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.372,1224.185,"-- conduct consists of factual matters, and I suppose it's conceivable a board might be misinformed, shouldn't be -- shouldn't he be entitled to cross-examine at least factual witnesses at that stage on his conduct, if you're right?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1224.185,1254.096,"I suppose an argument can be made that if the board of parole denies a parole when considering whether or not to -- to give a parole, denies it on the basis of allegations of fact concerning his conduct an argument could be made that he should be entitled to appear before the board as a matter of fact -- as a matter of practise, most -- as I understand, most prisoners at the time they are being considered for parole do appear before a board."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.309,1304.339,"Is the parole officers or the board which the revocation is based on page 65, is that -- is that the report?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1304.339,1314.495,"That is the report with respect to petitioner Morrissey and the report with respect to petitioner Booher is at page 106, I believe."
1971.71-5103,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.495,1314.743,All right.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1315.32,1331.156,"When he have -- had the interview that you've described at the institution, does this record show that he then admitted that he had bought the car under a false name?"

1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.231,1338.602,All we know about that comes from your brother's brief on the other side.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1339.975,1346.789,"Nothing in the record in the District Court, the Court of Appeals or in this case concerning that alleged hearing."
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1346.789,1386.673,"Assuming now that at that interview, the facts stated at the top of page 68 that he admitted that he bought the 1960 Chevrolet and so forth and registered it under a false name and having in mind that in one of the conditions of his parole as that he would neither own nor operate an automobile and other vehicles without the consent of the chief parole officer, would you think that would be grounds for making the decision without hearing any further from him after his admission?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1386.673,1401.764,"Well, I think that -- that the board of parole should after his admission that he in fact purchased an automobile under assumed name, I think the Court should hear from him his explanation whatever reasons that there may be in mitigation."
1971.71-5103,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1423.902,1440.121,"Mr. Brittin, in your brief, you point out that a parole hearing has a two-fold function, the first to ascertain whether or not it was a violation and the second to determine what to be done."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1448.01,1451.462,I think that that -- that the hearing relates to that part.
1971.71-5103,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1474.514,1479.918,And the hearing to be terminated at that point under your submission here today.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1479.918,1488.141,I believe that's correct that the hearing could be terminated once the board of parole has heard from the parolee.
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.401,1524.24,"There is -- there is an overlap which you suggest, however, is it there, because the -- you could show that the -- well, for example, one of the conditions of the parole agreement was that these petitioners not leave the county."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1524.24,1524.814,That's right.
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1524.814,1541.524,"And if you can show in a factual hearing, yes, he did leave the county but do -- you could further show that he left because his mother was dying, and he tried to reach his parole officer and it was a weekend and he couldn't reach his parole officer so in that emergency he left and he returned promptly --"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1541.524,1541.706,I believe that --
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1541.706,1553.383,"-- that would show a fact -- that would show a violation of the parole but the -- it would also show mitigating circumstances that would presumably affect the parole board's decision upon whether or not to revoke the parole, does it not?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1553.383,1554.352,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.359,1641.515,And to argue mitigating circumstances?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1641.515,1645.352,And to argue mitigating circumstances in the event that he does admit the fact.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.462,1698.498,You say --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1698.498,1699.096,-- based upon that conviction.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.096,1702.179,-- you say he's going to be in custody while he is waiting for that trial.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1704.431,1704.496,Well --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1704.496,1704.821,-- could be applied?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1704.821,1706.615,"-- in that -- I believe you're correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1716.566,1744.913,"I understand your arguments that it's a -- perhaps a technical violation to leave the county in order to get a job under the circumstances of Booher's case, but as to Morrissey where he bought the car under a false name and he entered in the contracts in which he signed the names of other persons to purchase furniture and various things, you wouldn't really call those technical violations, would you?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1744.913,1746.64,They may -- they are certainly not --
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.64,1748.829,One is either fraud or forgery.
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1748.829,1750.478,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1760.689,1766.287,What is the practice in Iowa when a parole agent is on vacation?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1768.794,1770.692,It's a matter of saying that there's only one in county.
1971.71-5103,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1806.962,1809.388,What is the county's procedure then?
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1809.388,1810.817,"I don't -- I can't think of it, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1817.324,1831.681,"You're not making any claim in this case that the parole agreement itself is so impossibly vague as to not really said any ascertainable standards, are you?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1831.681,1832.243,"You know, Your Honor, we have --"
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.243,1832.406,Referring to paragraph 6 (Voice Overlap) --
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1832.406,1833.769,-- not made that argument here.
1971.71-5103,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.14,1849.241,"I will avoid questionable associates, keep reasonable hours, avoid all places of questionable reputation, it would be pretty -- that'd be rather subjective as to whether or not he violated those provisions or not."
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1849.241,1861.704,I think that a very good argument could be made that -- that this -- this type of thing they're talking about is another reason why a hearing may be -- may be critical prior to revocation of this parole.
1971.71-5103,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.803,1875.124,"Well, if -- even if parts of it were, there's nothing vague about the majority of the provisions, is there?"
1971.71-5103,0,44105,w_don_brittin_jr,,1875.124,1876.402,"No, I -- I think that's correct, Your Honor."

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,1902.356,1906.743,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-5103,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1985.539,1987.527,"But that's internally inconsistent, isn't it?"

1971.71-5103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.989,2036.479,Is this a statutory matter?
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2036.479,2040.261,"It is not -- it is not a statutory requirement that they received, Your Honor."

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2052.375,2059.271,"The practice is, as we've stated in our brief, is to provide a post-revocation hearing."

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2078.871,2082.232,I think what happened in this case is substantially the practice.

1971.71-5103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.004,2499.02,"Never mind, that's all right."
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2499.02,2499.479,Okay.
1971.71-5103,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2575.913,2604.535,"But isn't there -- isn't there a great deal of difference including a psychological difference and -- when alone and perhaps a burden of proof difference as to whether or not the hearing is held prior to the decision of the parole board to revoke parole as contrasted with the hearing after that fate, I call plea, after the board has decided to revoke parole, then there's a very great burden, is there not, on the parolee to -- to convince the board to undo what it's done?"
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2616.607,2628.917,"Your Honor, I think if the situation was one where the parolee steadfastly denied the allegations alleged that that psychological difference might come -- might come into practice."
1971.71-5103,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2628.917,2630.04,And how about burden of proof?

1971.71-5103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.711,2758.271,"In a violation, it means failure."

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2826.023,2827.335,"That's correct, Your Honor."

1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2878.859,2879.205,That's it.
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2879.205,2879.678,-- warrant for arrest.
1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2879.678,2882.845,So automatically then he's picked up on that and --

1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2918.136,2923.079,-- and then what's -- what's the procedure then which leads to an order of revocation?
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2923.079,2935.346,The procedure then is that the board of parole on just really on the basis of the information contained therein and on any past records of the individual vote individually -- usually --
1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2935.346,2937.338,Wouldn't they be by telephone or mail?
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2937.338,2938.251,"Normally, it's by mail."
1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2948.553,2953.285,"And until that procedure has been completed, the parolee is not picked up."
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2953.285,2954.56,"Well, he may be in jail."

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2978.749,2980.828,That comes through the local authorities.

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2991.969,2992.66,That is correct.

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,2993.679,2994.157,That is correct.
1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2994.157,2996.933,"Now, that parole officer decided he'd committed violations."

1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2997.58,3004.633,"Now, then how -- what was the procedure which led up to Booher's going to the county jail?"
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3004.633,3027.575,"The parole officer, with -- usually it's a matter of informing the chief parole officer in Des Moines who supervises the whole operation of the information available to him and that he wished a warrant issued to pick up petitioner Booher because he was in the process of filing a reported violation on him --"
1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3027.575,3030.553,"Now -- now, the warrant is an administrative warrant?"

1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3038.592,3047.22,"Yes, yes, which picks up or arrests petitioner Booher and incarcerates him in a local jail."
1971.71-5103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3048.02,3049.049,Then they start the process --

1971.71-5103,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3341.741,3343.123,Bearing out what you've learned in -- in your brief.
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3343.123,3347.116,"Yes, bearing out the general procedure not that these two individuals specifically had one."
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.116,3351.447,"Mr. Seuferer, I'm looking at page 67 of the appendix now."
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3369.72,3370.524,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.524,3377.245,-- that's followed in turn by a recital of previous violations and his parole history.
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3389.571,3395.402,I think it's -- it's substantially typical in terms of -- of what they've covered.
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3434.332,3456.182,"Now, you've said in response to some questions from the bench that before the warrant, the violation, parole violation warrant is served in the arrest made, there is some local magistrate or officer, a neutral officer who issues that magistrate, just who is that?"
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3456.182,3456.303,Your Honor that's --
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.303,3458.31,The municipal judge or what kind of an officer?
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3458.31,3461.353,"No, I -- I'm not -- Your Honor, I'm not really sure who issues that warrant."
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3466.382,3470.128,But it's a local -- it's a person in the locality where the agent and the --
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3470.128,3470.234,I think --
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.234,3470.383,-- violator.
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3470.383,3471.787,-- that is usually the situation.
1971.71-5103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3488.008,3489.154,"This is just, in all practice --"
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3489.154,3489.52,It's a procedure thing.
1971.71-5103,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.52,3500.192,"-- for -- for all intents and purposes it's a case of a parole desk police officer determining that the facts of such, that there's probable cause to arrest and arresting."
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3500.192,3501.167,"In essence that's correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3501.246,3511.385,And I thought it's down under 247.9 of your code which makes a parolee subject to anytime to be taken into custody.
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3511.385,3513.027,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3513.027,3548.051,Would it administratively be feasible if the process that's covered in this report of the parole officer be presented to that local magistrate or whatever other officer may be involved on the warrant and have him at least make a preliminary determination and give the parolee an opportunity to answer to the specific charges before the revocation -- before the arrest was made?
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3548.051,3550.691,If your question is would that be administratively possible --
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3550.691,3550.79,Yes.
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3550.79,3553.112,"-- I think it probably would, Your Honor, as to what --"
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3553.112,3558.746,Remember in Hyser against Reed that was what was ordered with respect to the federal system that within --
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3558.746,3559.122,That's correct.
1971.71-5103,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3559.122,3575.776,"-- within a reasonable time, after the determination of a probable violation, the parolee must be given an opportunity to be heard to show why he should not be arrested and returned to the federal institution."
1971.71-5103,1,35170,lawrence_s_seuferer,,3575.776,3576.488,"That's correct, Your Honor."
