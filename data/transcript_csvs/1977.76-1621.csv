1977.76-1621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.197,"We will hear arguments next in 76-1621, McAdams against McSurely."
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,69.339,72.693,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.282,118.046,"Mr. Easterbrook, I do not know whether you were in Court yesterday night when my brother Brennan asked counsel to the proceeding case how the appeal came from the District Court to the Court of Appeals."
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,126.289,127.755,It was your Honor.
1977.76-1621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.6,140.602,They equated it to a kind of double jeopardy?
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,140.602,158.037,"They equated it – they essentially followed the analysis of this Court followed in Abney, that is that since the speech or debate clause creates a right not to be questioned in any other place, and since the process of discovery in trial is the kind of questioning that the speech or debate clause forbids, if it applies here."
1977.76-1621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.929,177.251,We are not bound of course by the party’s stipulations or agreements on a jurisdictional platform?
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,177.251,181.211,"No, of course not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but we think it does follow from Abney."
1977.76-1621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,181.211,189.176,"Under that ration -- the Abney rationale, could we consider any kind of immunity claim other than one predicated squarely on the speech and debate clause?"
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,189.176,195.978,"Probably not, Your Honor, not at this stage and indeed that was the basis of our appeal."
1977.76-1621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,240.046,244.817,Would you say again what the First District Court litigation was?
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,244.817,249.379,The three-judge District Court litigation concerned the constitutionality of the Kentucky Sedition Statute.
1977.76-1621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.379,250.411,And held it as unconstitutional --
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,250.411,252.952,And held it was unconstitutional --
1977.76-1621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.952,257.86,"As an auxiliary to that, it entered the sequestration order, custody order?"
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,257.86,261.082,"It entered an order, it entered a custody order."
1977.76-1621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.515,278.602,Whose attempt?
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,278.602,282.367,The attempt by the senate subcommittee to subpoena the documents.
1977.76-1621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.753,316.924,"But what happened in this case happened during the life of the custody order, did it not?"
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,316.924,326.911,"Well, the complaint that was originally filed by respondents challenged not only the fact that Brick looked at the documents and took copies of them back to Washington."
1977.76-1621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,349.317,356.325,"In this time spectrum, will you pinpoint just when it was that Mr. Brick and his colleagues came into possession?"
1977.76-1621,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,356.325,365.922,Mr. Brick came into possession of the 234 copies in the fall of 1967 and they were immediately taken back to Washington.
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2007.27,2012.573,Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1977.76-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.313,2091.164,"Do you agree Mr. Stavis that all we have here is the question of whether there is speech and debate clause immunity, assuming that the plaintiff complaint stated a claim for relief?"
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2091.164,2095.11,That is the only question that the government presented in its petition.
1977.76-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.11,2099.253,We do not pass that on whether the complaint stated a claim for relief?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2099.253,2101.393,Well that is assumed.
1977.76-1621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2272.492,2277.625,"That act specifically means what, what are you referring to?"
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2277.625,2287.909,"Well, I am talking about the taking of these papers, the reading of all of these papers, the bringing of them to Washington which is the heart of what this complaint is about."
1977.76-1621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.909,2291.531,"Well, is it not the -- what is the first act, what is the initial?"
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2291.531,2295.594,The initial act was the receipt of the papers.
1977.76-1621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.594,2296.924,Receiving them from the state authority.
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2296.924,2333.262,"Well, actually we are going down pipe flow, taking the papers from the state officials, inspecting all the papers that had been seized, doing this and bring them back to Washington knowing that plaintiffs had gone to Court to obtain a return of their papers and the Court had agreed that they were entitled to the return of their papers and had given the safekeeping order only to give the respond of the defendant there namely the Prosecuting Attorney an opportunity to appeal if he chose."
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.262,2349.205,"Mr. Stavis are you conceding when you emphasize the critical effect that if Senator McCullen had caused a subpoena to be served on Ratcliffe, the custodian of the papers and pursuant to that subpoena, they had been turned over to Brick and Brick had made 234 copies and taken it back, you would have no case?"
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2349.205,2351.388,"Well, I am not really sure of that --"
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.388,2354.147,But you said it was a critical thing?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2354.147,2380.191,"I know that Eastland against Servicemen is an important argument for the suggestions that you are making Mr. Justice Stevens because there the Court held in effect that when the government, when the committee issues a subpoena that that is a process that the Court will not interfere with at least in a suit against the Senator."
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.191,2385.932,But it did not say anything about what it could do about refusing to turn the documents over and resisting a contempt citation?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2385.932,2400.425,That is correct nor did it say anything as to what could be done to prevent Ratcliffe from turning over the documents by a suit against Ratcliffe which is essentially what we did after Ratcliffe was served with a subpoena.
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.664,2432.404,But the case that I am hypothesizing is the one in which perhaps you did not find out about the subpoena because the Senator just signed a subpoena and Brick took it down to Ratcliffe and said turnover the documents and be done so.
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2435.562,2443.433,"I am not so sure where it had been done in a manner, so that we were kept unaware of it."
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.716,2455.971,But then you are making up to a position that the subpoena is critical?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2455.971,2458.719,"No I am not sir, if I may suggest."
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.704,2495.019,"First of all we are just concerned here with the liability of the Senator and his aides, not with what could have been done by way of (Voice Overlap) and as you know sometimes committees proceed by subpoena, sometimes they write a formal letter."
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2506.216,2509.156,That might not be very much different from a subpoena.
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.878,2519.689,If you know about it?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2519.689,2520.852,If you know about it.
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.995,2584.789,So your submission must be that unless you are going to talk about -- unless you are talking about a committee hearing or a subpoena just to investigation generally in the field just is not an essential part of the legislative process?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2584.789,2586.479,That is right.
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.479,2596.401,Because you must say that just field investigators must obey the law whether it is the law of trespass or it is the law of the constitution?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2596.401,2608.388,That is correct and that comes out of the recognition of this Court from the beginning that you have to circumscribe the space in the back room.
1977.76-1621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.388,2613.617,It is like the FBI doing whatever the prosecutors asked him to do?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2613.617,2616.543,Same problem.
1977.76-1621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.447,2652.244,Do you distinguish all between Senator McCullen in here and the aides?
1977.76-1621,1,36744,morton_stavis,,2652.244,2655.887,"Not at all, not since the Gravel Case."
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3908.675,3911.883,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1621,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.897,3929.956,You mean investigative authority that is within the --
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3929.956,3932.273,Within the power of Article 1.
1977.76-1621,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3932.273,3933.918,"Well, that is within the speech or debate."
1977.76-1621,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3933.918,3935.352,Within the immunity of the speech or debate clause.
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3935.352,3937.616,We think the two are the same.
1977.76-1621,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3937.616,3939.956,But his argument was the --
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3939.956,3954.195,Let me start with the premise that this Court started with in Servicemen’s Fund which is that Congress must have the power to investigate or it would be unable intelligently to pass legislation.
1977.76-1621,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3975.714,3984.187,"Do you understand Mr. Stavis as challenging, his saying that there is no investigatory power?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3984.187,3988.69,Mr. Stavis seems to contend I think that there is no informal investigatory power.
1977.76-1621,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4088.232,4101.24,"Would you think if materials are subpoenaed and the person does not respond, he is entitled to litigate whether Congress may secure the documents or not?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4101.24,4109.022,"Mr. Justice White, the Court has held that in response to a contempt citation, he can litigate whether that was within the authority of Congress."
1977.76-1621,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4109.022,4114.978,The Court sit on that sort of proceeding?
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4114.978,4115.992,Yes Your Honor they do --
1977.76-1621,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4115.992,4119.39,You must suggest to Congress that perhaps some of the subpoenas are good and some are not?
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4119.39,4133.711,"Yes, In much the same way, some of Congress’ statutes are good and some are not as this Court sits deciding whether statutes that are passed were constitutional within their power, but that does not mean that the process of getting to the statute is defective in any way."
1977.76-1621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4133.711,4146.947,"If you are right as I understand it, whenever somebody did not comply with the subpoena, the congressional committee could just send some police officers with a guns and break into the house and get the information?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4146.947,4147.93,I have two answers to that.
1977.76-1621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4175.279,4178.644,"You mean just illegally, not just by force?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4178.644,4182.011,"Illegally or by force, but I am willing to accept by force here."
1977.76-1621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4183.58,4185.229,And you are willing to accept illegally?
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4185.229,4198.484,"Yes, but our response is that the remedy lies in Congress’ discipline of its own members and in the public’s discipline of Congress rather than in discipline by the judicial branch of Congress’ errors."
1977.76-1621,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4253.563,4262.884,"If we were to hold and conclude that there was not Fourth Amendment violation here, what would be the consequence on the case?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4262.884,4279.194,"Mr. Chief Justice if there were no Fourth Amendment violation, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the complaint dismissed although we have not raised that issue which was the subject of Judge Wilkie’s opinion."
1977.76-1621,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4279.194,4286.292,"If we should disagree with your principle argument, what issue if any would remain for us to address?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4286.292,4295.954,"Mr. Justice Powell, we have raised a subsidiary argument about vicarious liability that we believe you can accept without addressing our principle argument."
1977.76-1621,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4300.678,4302.033,I am not suggesting you go into it.
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4303.713,4305.315,We have not waived it.
1977.76-1621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4313.747,4317.62,"So you are not pressing the position of the four and the Court of Appeals, the five?"
1977.76-1621,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,4317.62,4319.166,We are not.
