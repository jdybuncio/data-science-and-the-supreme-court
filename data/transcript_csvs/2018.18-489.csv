2018.18-489,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.235,6.53,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-489, Taggart versus Lorenzen. Mr. Geyser."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,6.53,18.46,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the Ninth Circuit below, a creditor's subjective good faith belief categorically precludes any liability for discharge violations under the code."
2018.18-489,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,98.225,108.3,"But in this case, isn't it the case -- isn't it true that the state court and the bankruptcy court held that Taggart had returned to the fray --"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,108.3,108.74,They --
2018.18-489,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,108.74,114.605,-- and that would -- therefore there would not have been a -- a violation of the discharge?
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,114.605,117.25,"If those courts were correct, but they were wrong."
2018.18-489,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,130.79,145.71,"But isn't it -- what is -- well, what is the justification for holding somebody in contempt for doing something that two state courts have held was not a violation?"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,145.71,146.91,"Well, first, Your Honor --"
2018.18-489,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,146.91,149.71,Even -- even if those courts turned out to be wrong.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,149.71,176.535,"Well, even if they -- they turn out to be wrong, but I think the -- the justification is first, that the fact that someone says that's something's permissible doesn't mean that it doesn't violate the code and that it doesn't impose real costs on the protected class. The -- Section 105 doesn't have any exception for a good faith error or for reasonable error, and the fact that a court might agree, even -- perhaps unreasonably, that that particular act was permitted doesn't make it so."
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.24,208.44,There's a sort of reverse problem.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,282.825,285.04,"Well, I -- I -- I hope not, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,285.04,285.48,But assuming --
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,285.48,285.62,I can --
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,285.62,285.74,-- it is --
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,285.74,286.02,-- try to --
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,286.02,290.09,-- assuming I think that the policy grounds are not as compelling as you think.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,290.09,290.51,Sure.
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.06,303.345,Then -- then how -- how do I square the belief that this requires more discretion than either of you are --
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,303.345,304.425,Well --
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,304.425,306.735,-- are positing or -- or want?
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,306.735,312.705,"Well, let -- let me make our position very clear, because our position actually embraces the Court's discretion under Section 105."
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.48,355.19,The problem with that --
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,355.19,355.67,-- provision of the code.
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,355.67,358.42,-- is you're -- you're -- you're putting into the code something that's not required.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,358.42,358.91,"Oh, but --"
2018.18-489,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.91,368.85,"That you're basically telling debtors, if you think you're not covered, you can't do what the code permits you to do; you have to go for that safe harbor to be safe."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,368.85,370.99,"Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor."
2018.18-489,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,389.51,403.57,"Okay, but in those cases -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm still struggling with this for a slightly different reason -- not only may a -- a creditor go to a state court to seek clarification in most issues."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,421.74,422.1,Well --
2018.18-489,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,422.1,423.69,So how do we account for that?
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,423.69,444.8,"Well, I -- I think this is how you account for that, Justice Gorsuch: If a -- if a creditor goes to, say, court and seeks a pure declaratory judgment, they're saying all I want to know is does this debt fall within the discharge, then that would put them on the same footing as Rule 4007. But that's not what most creditors do, and it's not what the Respondents did here. They affirmatively sought to collect the discharged debt."
2018.18-489,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,444.8,444.9,Right.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,456.685,461.61,"Well, no, the -- the error is that they -- they violated the discharge by affirmatively seeking to collect a discharged debt."
2018.18-489,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,461.61,461.7,Right.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,464.88,471.16,"If -- if they had done that as -- as opposed to trying to actually collect, then there'd be -- be both legal and practical differences."
2018.18-489,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,480.44,489.035,"Can't you do that at the same time? You go into the court and say here's the debt that I have, I want to collect it, but first I want to make sure that I -- I can do it."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,501.95,506.35,"Well, I -- I don't think it is more efficient, and half of that would be problematic and half of it wouldn't."
2018.18-489,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,522.28,522.99,"Well, maybe they do."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,532.74,534.19,"Well, that -- that's not what happened here."
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,553.63,584.75,"To back up a minute, the statute says that the order operates as an injunction, and the traditional rules of contempt for injunctions suggests that a reasonable, good faith belief that you weren't violating the order is sufficient. So why shouldn't that just follow squarely from the text referring to operates like an injunction, the traditional rules of injunctions, therefore, your --"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,584.75,584.87,Well --
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,584.87,588.5,-- position of strict liability or something close to it doesn't work?
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,588.5,589.25,"Well -- well, no."
2018.18-489,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,614.79,627.8,"I -- I found McComb a very confusing case, I have to admit, because sometimes it speaks in your language and sometimes it speaks in Ms. Saharsky's language and what are we to make of that? And I think I'll add on to this."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,640.89,674.6,"Well, we -- I was a little stunned, too, Your Honor, but I think that what is clear in the bankruptcy context, the overwhelming rule from the majority of jurisdictions is the one that we've set out in our brief. It's that if you're aware of the discharge and you violate it, then you're -- you're subject to remedial order under Section 105. And if you're concerned about creating a new rule and wading into this morass, the easiest way to resolve it is to look to Section 105, which provides independent statutory authority to create any order -- and that's -- that's broad language -- that's necessary or appropriate for carrying out the code. Now, the code prohibits collection attempts."
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,702.365,717.39,"To go back to the traditional rule, which you dispute, I understand that, but the fair ground of doubt principle, a lot of lower courts have applied that. And then you think about, well, what's the purpose here? Well, the purpose is contempt, it's a severe sanction."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,743.385,745.09,"Well, I -- I think in a couple different ways."
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,751.87,755.7,"But it's been applied by a lot of lower courts up to the present, correct?"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,755.7,790.48,"But -- but they've applied it in a way that actually is consistent with our reading. Take the TiVo decision from the Federal Circuit, the en banc Federal Circuit looked at the principles both in McComb and in Molitor and they said that they specifically rejected the proposition that there is a good faith objectively reasonable defense to the actual violation of the injunction. The way -- where they incorporate the fair ground of doubt rule is they say does the injunction actually apply? So it's not a rule that says you can violate an injunction and then you're excused because you had good faith. It's saying we'll construe the injunction not to reach your conduct. So that the --"
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,790.48,792.3,Are those really two different things?
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,792.3,796.29,"Well, I -- I think they are two different things, because look at how it would play out here."
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,849.825,862.73,"You make it sound easy but there are a lot of states on an amicus brief, a real cross-section of states who say your rule would really hamper them in real world collection efforts. How do you respond to that?"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,862.73,862.82,Well --
2018.18-489,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,862.82,863.84,Are they just wrong about that?
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,863.84,870.985,"I -- I think -- I think they're wrong and I think the concerns are overstated. First, they -- they don't account for the fact that the rule, again, that we're not proposing something new."
2018.18-489,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,967.4,977.875,"Mr. -- Mr. Geyser, the strength of your rule, I would say, is in the realm of compensatory damages, but here there were punitive damages as -- as well, and what justification would there be for that?"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,977.875,982.01,"Well, the -- the -- to be clear, the punitive damages here, it was a $2,000 award."
2018.18-489,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1054.25,1080.02,"It's something they -- they have to buy a lawyer, and -- it's complicated, 4007. What -- what I want to know is the Court wrote, I guess in a case called California Artificial Stone, this is contempt. And it says contempt is a severe remedy and it should not be resorted to where there is a fair ground of doubt. Well, I understand that."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1103.375,1105.24,"Well, it -- it's not, Justice Breyer."
2018.18-489,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.05,1109.67,"That was before, wasn't it?"
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1109.67,1111.39,"No, it's -- it's the same case."
2018.18-489,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1111.39,1111.745,Oh.
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1111.745,1115.53,And if -- the -- the government teases two propositions out of that case.
2018.18-489,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.19,1122.535,"Well, but that would have to be more general."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1126.335,1127.01,They -- they do.
2018.18-489,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.815,1237.96,"Well, why not -- why not say -- well, what do you think, it says the statute, that the court can grant, ""take any action or make any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement the court orders or rules."" So why doesn't it -- but that bankruptcy judge have the power to say, well, we think in your case it does, in fact, require considerable damages, as you were on the brink there, and some other case say no, it's just compensatory damages, and some other case say half that."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1241.055,1244.885,"Well, the -- it's -- again, our position is that the court does have that discretion."
2018.18-489,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.4,1273.535,"It's not conjure up. They think, look, I'd say if the person wasn't in good faith, say that."
2018.18-489,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1283.855,1288.4,"Well, the -- their contention, though, is that the court would not have discretion."
2018.18-489,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.43,1322.205,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joshi."
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1322.205,1329.71,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I should first say the ground has somewhat shifted in this case beneath us since the time we filed our brief."
2018.18-489,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.67,1399.945,"Well, it takes into account the -- the deep policy in the Bankruptcy Code to grant relief to the honest debtor."
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1442.785,1444.86,So a -- a number of responses to that.
2018.18-489,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1473.48,1483.415,"Right, but the whole point is here is, you know, who -- who bears the risk of -- of the fact that you -- there's some doubt about whether a debt is discharged or not?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1483.415,1483.9,Right.
2018.18-489,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1483.9,1493.06,"The person who is supposed to get the fresh start or the person who can just quickly jump into the bankruptcy court and say is this dischargeable or not, and -- and to not have to worry about it?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1493.06,1495.32,So we disagree that it's that quick of a jump.
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1562.89,1585.57,"One of the difficulties, I think, for your side of the case is the decision in McComb, which is rather a hard-line view of civil contempt. It seems to me that one possible answer -- and I just want your thoughts on this -- is that McComb dealt with a situation where you had a rather contumacious party that had already disobeyed several orders."
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1590.44,1593.04,I -- I think that's exactly right.
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1609.58,1617.225,"So to the extent that they were worried about who bears the burden of risk, it may shift over time based on behavior?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1617.225,1623.195,"That is certainly true. It wouldn't be civil contempt, though, for violating the discharge injunction."
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1625.08,1625.3,Prior.
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1625.3,1635.48,"-- kinds of sanctions for other related sorts of litigation misconduct or -- or, you know, contumacious or vexatious conduct. I would also hasten to add that we embrace McComb."
2018.18-489,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1672.945,1680.535,"Could -- could you explain to me, Mr. Joshi, what the difference is between your rule and the Respondents' rule? And whether it matters?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1680.535,1681.12,Right.
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1714.52,1728.385,"Well, is it irrelevant -- I'm -- is it irrelevant? I mean, can subjective, good faith be some evidence of objective, good behavior and can subjective bad faith be some evidence of objective bad behavior?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1728.385,1730.2,"Yes, and I was about to get to that --"
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1730.2,1730.29,Okay.
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1730.55,1731.36,-- to the exception.
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1731.36,1732.43,That's all I wanted to hear you say --
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1732.43,1733.44,Thank you for raising it.
2018.18-489,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1733.44,1736.375,"-- then Justice Breyer. Oh, good."
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1737.845,1738.56,Right.
2018.18-489,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1765.03,1788.53,"So could I understand that a little bit better? Because the -- your statement in your brief confused me a little bit. But you're saying that the facts that lead to subjective good faith would also be indicators of objective reasonableness. You're not saying, as I understand it, although you do say in your brief, you say in your brief that the belief itself is relevant to objective reasonableness?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1788.53,1798.27,"So the belief might have probative evidentiary value, to the extent it is highly correlated with those facts, which will overlap in the objective analysis, so that may --"
2018.18-489,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1798.27,1801.045,As long as it's easy to apply. (Laughter.)
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1801.045,1810.575,"So, look, I'm -- I'm not going to stand in your way if you want to close the door that I have left open for the -- for the evidentiary value of subjective, good faith belief."
2018.18-489,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1835.605,1847.51,"So it -- just to be clear on this, ""reasonable, good faith belief"" is the articulation Respondent has. How would you alter that, just say ""reasonable belief""?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1847.51,1862.15,"""Reasonable belief"" might work or simply adopt the text in California Artificial Stone Paving and say where as an objective matter there's a fair ground of doubt about whether the injunction prohibits the challenged conduct, then civil contempt is unavailable. Otherwise --"
2018.18-489,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1862.15,1868.84,How is fair ground of doubt different than a reasonable belief that the discharge order did not apply to the conduct?
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1868.84,1871.35,They may well land in the same place.
2018.18-489,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1877.05,1877.14,Okay.
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1877.14,1881.645,-- are not something the courts need to or really ought to be probing.
2018.18-489,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1881.645,1886.075,So it is reasonable to conclude that the discharge order did not apply to the conduct?
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1886.075,1895.69,"I think we wouldn't have a problem with that, with that formulation. Meanwhile, Petitioner's rule, again, in -- in one of the ground shifting, if I --"
2018.18-489,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1895.69,1901.57499995,"And why not affirm under your position, rather than vacate?"
2018.18-489,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1901.57499995,1920.3,"So we think there are -- this Court's ordinary practice when announcing a new rule is to remand, especially because none of the lower courts have applied the rule we set forth here today. But there remains some -- you, of course, have jurisdiction to reach it, but we believe there remains some legal and factual issues to decide."
2018.18-489,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.94,1940.81499995,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1940.81499995,1951.64,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: We acted reasonably and in good faith. Notwithstanding that, we were held in contempt of court, which included attorneys' fees and punitive damages."
2018.18-489,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1958.88,1959.07,Do -- do you --
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1959.07,1959.79,-- where I'd like --
2018.18-489,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1959.79,1964.38,Do you think the Ninth Circuit's test needs to be modified?
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1964.38,1974.28,"I think the Court should say unreasonable good faith -- or, I'm sorry, reasonable good faith belief, and that's not exactly what the Ninth Circuit said, so we think the Court should go ahead and clarify that, yes."
2018.18-489,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1974.28,2004.19,"I'm a little curious why you haven't adopted the government's standard? I -- I -- I've sat down trying to figure out the Venn diagram of when they don't overlap. And the one -- the one scenario that comes to my mind is what if some creditor had a not well-founded, subjective belief, but he was objectively reasonable, objectively reasonable but bad faith, he didn't do any work, he didn't do any due diligence, he just filed, it turned out he was right, objectively reasonable."
2018.18-489,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2006.435,2008.78,I would have thought you'd want to protect that creditor.
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2025.65,2026.295,Sure.
2018.18-489,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2052.84,2053.45,All right.
2018.18-489,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2059.41,2068.19,"But I guess I'm wondering, assuming we were writing on a blank slate, would you disagree with the government's test, and, if so, why?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2068.19,2070.33,An objective standard would be fine by us.
2018.18-489,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2084.87,2085.02,Could you --
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2085.02,2086.41,We think the Court has left that open.
2018.18-489,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2089.39,2092.645,I think you were going to identify a few of the other cases.
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2092.645,2097.03,"Yes, I actually wanted to point the Court, I think, to four cases that we think are particularly relevant."
2018.18-489,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2175.8,2182.46,"Ms. -- Ms. Saharsky, in the universe of cases that we're talking about, we know that the discharge injunction has been violated."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2216.11,2217.6,I think that's a terrific question.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.87,2264.17,"Well, you could be --"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2264.17,2264.64,And the Court said --
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2264.64,2268.605,"-- you could be sanctioned under contempt through monetary sanction, right?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2268.605,2273.28,"If a person meets the standard from -- for contempt, they could face monetary sanctions, including --"
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.28,2273.78,So it seems to me --
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2273.78,2274.07,-- attorneys' fees.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2274.07,2287.78,"-- why can't a court say, well, okay, I'm going to fine you because of your contemptuous behavior and, you know, how much should it be? The amount of the attorneys' fees seems to be a pretty reasonable number. It doesn't mean that he's violating the American rule."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2292.315,2293.48,I agree with that.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2323.28,2323.94,"Well, one thing --"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2323.94,2324.1,And so --
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2324.1,2333.15,"-- you didn't do, which you could easily have done, is -- is get -- get a -- a ruling in the -- from the bankruptcy court whether the debt was discharged or not."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2336.305,2337.2,"Well, state --"
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2337.2,2340.165,Because -- and you guessed wrong on whether it was.
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2344.05,2347.71,"So we -- we were in state court, as -- as the Court knows from the briefs."
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2364.51,2365.87,To decide which issue?
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2365.87,2369.665,To decide whether that is a discharged debt under the bankruptcy.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.84,2381.8,"Well, the sense is it's a safe harbor."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2381.8,2395.655,"Well, but the -- a -- a couple of -- I think there are a couple of answers to that: First of all, I think there is the answer in terms of what Congress intended and then I think there's a policy answer. So in terms of what Congress intended, as we have discussed, Congress did not require advance determinations."
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.96,2480.54,"Well, it's not so much --"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2480.54,2480.81,-- can collect.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2480.81,2482.16,-- it's not so much the procedure.
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2505.925,2506.76,Right.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2516.32,2516.56,"Well, I think --"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2516.56,2516.86,-- to the policy --
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2516.86,2518.18,-- we should do what Congress wants.
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2518.18,2518.24,We're --
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2518.24,2519.74,It's just a question of what they want.
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2519.74,2520.08,Right.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.98,2548.49,"Well, yes, it does --"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2548.49,2552.87,-- the interests of the courts who are going to be burdened by these procedures in a way that Congress didn't intend.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2552.87,2575.29,"Yeah, it -- it does have some chilling effect on creditors, and it doesn't surprise me that creditors don't like that. But that chilling effect makes them -- since allowing the creditors to proceed on debts that may or may not be dischargeable, it seems to me perfectly reasonable to have them bear the risk, make -- have them make a careful choice."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2575.29,2576.52,I understand that.
2018.18-489,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2610.62,2610.81,If --
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2610.81,2611.72,It's many cases.
2018.18-489,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2611.72,2620.235,"As -- as I understand it, and tell me if I'm wrong, but in the automatic stay context, under, what is it, 362(k) or something?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2620.235,2620.81,Correct.
2018.18-489,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2620.81,2662.315,"There when -- if -- if there is a violation of the automatic stay, and there was, you know, an -- sort of an intentional act that resulted in that violation, the violator would be on the hook for any damages that resulted, irrespective of the reasonableness of his -- of -- of his beliefs. Do you understand that to work that way? And, if you do, why shouldn't we have the exact same rule in the two contexts? In other words, why shouldn't we say if you violate the automatic stay, if you violate the discharge injunction, you should be treated exactly the same way, under the same standard, with respect to the costs that you impose?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2662.315,2662.8,Right.
2018.18-489,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2781.885,2793.79,"Just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question from earlier, it sounded like you don't object to an objective standard, but you had rolled in good faith based on some of our cases; is that accurate?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2793.79,2794.42,Yes.
2018.18-489,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2843.43,2865.92,"When do you think that a reason could not be objectively -- an objective ground that could be still reasonable? Meaning, I understand your answer to Justice Gorsuch, which is that somebody doesn't do research and just says I don't want to pay, I'm just going to do this."
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2891.46,2897.59,"Well, if I'm understanding the question, you know, I think there's a -- there is a spectrum really of reasonableness."
2018.18-489,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.56,2910.09,"Well, that -- that might --"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2910.09,2910.95,"-- to your case, do you also --"
2018.18-489,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2910.95,2927.6,"-- get you up to that proceeding, but how about if the court's decision is so flawed that you decide to fight the appeal on it and don't concede that they were wrong?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2927.6,2933.98,"Well, in this case, you know, we're -- we're consistent -- our position is consistent with what the state court and the bankruptcy court did."
2018.18-489,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2974.48,2974.68,Because --
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2974.68,2975.84500005,-- deciding.
2018.18-489,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2975.84500005,2986.655,"Because your standard is slightly different or more than slightly than the Ninth Circuit's, why shouldn't we vacate rather than affirm as the Solicitor General suggests?"
2018.18-489,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2986.655,2987.25,Sure.
2018.18-489,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.37999995,3063.555,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geyser, three minutes remaining."
2018.18-489,3,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3063.555,3072.29,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, for the American rule, Congress did not think that these fees were fees as fees; they were fees as damages."
2018.18-489,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3246.005,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
