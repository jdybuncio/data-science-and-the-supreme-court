1965.487,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,45.357,"Number 487, William Malat et ux. -- et al., versus Robert A. Riddell, District Director of Internal Revenue."
1965.487,0,24875,george_t_altman,,46.4,46.413,Yes.
1965.487,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,46.413,54.821,-- you may proceed with your argument.
1965.487,0,24875,george_t_altman,,54.821,55.856,If the Court please.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1925.402,1928.918,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.26,2128.725,The -- of course the statute doesn't quite describe the definition that you as said.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2129.116,2129.352,No.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.352,2131.104,-- the properties held primarily --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2131.104,2131.217,No.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.217,2132.276,-- for the sale to customers.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2132.276,2133.03,That's right.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.504,2175.98,"And it narrowed down really, doesn't it or am I mistaken to the meaning of the word ‘primarily' in the statute?"
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2175.98,2178.026,That's -- that's right.
1965.487,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2399.397,2401.188,The issue is little different in the Agnew case.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2434.478,2434.917,Yes.
1965.487,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2434.917,2437.834,But you don't have to look the particular piece of property over the statute?
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2437.834,2438.907,Absolutely.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2498.346,2514.413,"Mr. Levin, do you take the -- on the attempt of the taxpayer as of the time of the sale or do you take the original intent even though in last sentence, he used the word ‘your burden the intent at the time of acquisition is settled to me'."
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2514.413,2519.302,"Well, Your Honor as we point out in our brief, this is -- this is not an easy question."
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2523.324,2524.043,Yes.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2524.043,2531.778,We do not think that the purpose for which was acquired is determinative nor do we think that the purpose for which was sold is solely determinative.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2700.96,2703.974,That's a total consideration that all the transaction --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2703.974,2704.676,That's right.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2704.676,2704.951,-- including --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2704.951,2705.399,If --
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2705.399,2706.44,-- including the --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2706.44,2707.161,That's right.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2707.161,2710.335,-- ones that are clearly of a capital gains nature.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2710.335,2710.583,"Well, --"
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2710.583,2712.244,And the ones that are -- they rent only?
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2712.244,2720.338,We -- we do not concede that any of the transactions were clearly of a capital gains nature.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2720.338,2722.479,I thought you said in the response to --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2722.479,2723.848,Any of these particular transactions --
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2723.848,2724.056,No.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2746.466,2748.194,You could.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2748.959,2751.563,"You could and you must under the statute, mustn't you?"
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2751.563,2751.871,Yes.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2752.836,2753.233,Yes.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2753.233,2754.6,"We agree, you must."
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2760.018,2775.414,"Oh, what I'm really asking is whether -- is there any dispute in your mind as to the major or majority whatever you want to call it trust of the Lesser business."
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2775.414,2784.143,Well -- what I'm tempting to demonstrate here is that as regular part of their business they engaged in all facets of the real estate transactions.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2839.369,2842.312,In what -- in what category does that fall?
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2842.312,2849.565,"Well, since this case did not concern that piece of property with an earlier year, apparently the statute of limitations run."
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2851.454,2855.164,I know that but do you know how it was treated by the taxpayer?
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2855.164,2855.71,Yes.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3294.996,3298.705,"Mr. Levin, we are not here really to weigh the evidence but --"
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3298.705,3298.919,No.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3298.919,3305.333,-- whether to decide whether or not the Court of Appeals and the District Court applied the correct test under the --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3305.333,3305.608,That's right.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.608,3306.387,-- statute and that --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3306.387,3309.815,I -- I turn it only because petitioner he has argued it rather extensively.
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.815,3324.974,The Court of Appeals had the ‘primary' meant -- ‘primarily' meant to a ‘substantially' and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is said that primary -- ‘primarily' means ‘predominantly' and so and then the Sixth Circuit and the Second Circuit of taking kind of a middle course.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3325.715,3327.543,"Well, I -- no I don't think they're taking the middle course."
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3336.593,3337.934,The Eighth Circuit has said that --
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3337.934,3339.363,The Eighth Circuit which by (Voice Overlap) --
1965.487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.363,3340.273,-- primarily?
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3340.273,3343.968,The Eighth Circuit has said in the case somewhat similar to this.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3478.102,3510.718,"Suppose there were incontestable finding that these people are required at all of these property or purposes of a development on the rental basis and that there came a point of time where for whatever reason, they subdivided some of it and sold it all and paid capital gains, have paid the tax on that at ordinary income rates."
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3532.637,3535.918,I -- I think you could very welcome out much differently.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3555.543,3555.886,"No, no."
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3555.934,3557.24,-- subdivided in 50-acre.
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3557.24,3557.61,Yes.
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3574.247,3576.015,"No, we don't take position."
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3658.325,3662.848,"Well, that so, how do you arrive at your result in the present case?"
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3666.629,3666.704,We -- we think that the --
1965.487,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3666.704,3668.879,What are the crucial factors?
1965.487,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3668.879,3671.2,"Well, the crucial factors, alright."
1965.487,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3783.324,3784.091,Mr. Altman.
1965.487,2,24875,george_t_altman,,3784.091,3789.269,Yes.
