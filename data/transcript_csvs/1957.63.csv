1957.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.257,"Herman A. Beilan, Petitioner, versus Board School District of Philadelphia."
1957.63,0,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,21.472,23.683,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2432.994,2439.614,"Mr. Chief Justice, and with respectful submission to Your Honors."
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2636.361,2641.564,Suppose he had asked him if he was a member of the Republican Central Committee.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2641.564,2667.452,"The Republican Central Committee, I would have thought sir that that would have nothing to do sir with the fitness or the competency of a teacher and it seems to me that there is a completely different area when you were dealing here with the sensitive area as Your Honors have said of the Public School System where the question of Communist affiliations is an important matter."
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2682.344,2698.811,"And now in -- in 1944, the date to which this question was directed, did the Republican -- did the man have any -- any less right to be a Communist in the State of Pennsylvania than he had to be a Republican?"
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2698.811,2698.91,I --
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2698.91,2709.547,And did have any less right in 1944 to participate in public elections from a Communist standpoint as they did to a Republican?
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2709.547,2718.494,"I think, sir, that the answer to that question lies again in the area of the interrogation, the --"
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2718.494,2721.923,"Well, let's -- let's get away from the area like -- like --"
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2721.923,2721.976,(Voice Overlap)
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2721.976,2724.817,-- Justice Frankfurter had been taking about.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2743.766,2746.007,"I think he would have had the same rights, sir."
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2746.007,2746.503,All right.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2746.503,2749.432,And register as a Republican or as a Communist --
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2749.432,2749.725,All right.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2749.725,2753.346,-- equally they were appropriately proper.
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2753.346,2753.727,Yes.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2766.713,2796.128,"Well, for this -- the only answer I can give you to that, sir, is that it seems to me that no matter how we cut the cable, the situation is different with reference to a -- an interrogation by a school superintendent regarding what has been conceived to be a suspect organization even though legal, if Your Honors please, as distinct from what we recognized as a straight political association."
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2804.439,2825.606,"But before we get to that, we had -- we had a case recently where the authorities considered the Progressive Party as suspect, and they -- they endeavored to interrogate a man about his activities in the Progressive Party."
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2834.644,2840.012,"I think in Sweezy, you could possibly have distinguished it -- distinguished this case."
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2850.004,2850.58,That's all right.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2851.08,2852.651,(Voice Overlap) -- [Laughter]
1957.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2852.651,2855.219,I would charge him.
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2855.219,2856.977,Approach more nearly --
1957.63,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2856.977,2860.365,"Who are the beneficiary of that remark, Mr. --"
1957.63,1,19955,c_brewster_rhoads,,2860.365,2861.797,Thank you sir.
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5359.492,5360.684,If Your Honors please.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5390.419,5398.112,"If I understand it, the 25 cases in which questions like these were put and teachers refused to answer and they were dismissed."
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5398.112,5398.66,"Right, sir."
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5402.271,5414.605,"Yes, but as to the five or six which Mr. Rhoads referred, they -- I suppose though, from my point of view, I'd imagine in the right mind, the School Board wouldn't make any (Inaudible)"
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5414.605,5416.792,I would think so Your Honor.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5424.731,5425.944,Is that your finding?
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5425.944,5426.651,"I did, sir."
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5426.651,5427.688,Why do you say that?
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5427.688,5442.602,Because I think that what they want from these teachers is the demonstration of an attitude of complacent agreement with everything the Board wants whether if the inquiry is about -- has loyalty or --
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5442.602,5442.709,I mean if --
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5442.709,5443.619,-- about the Republican Party.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5443.619,5449.051,But then it just means that you cannot very well search the concept of those who did answer.
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5449.051,5449.896,True sir.
1957.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5480.754,5487.869,"You mean the Fifth, they pleaded the Fifth Amendment before the congressional committee?"
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5487.869,5488.518,Right.
1957.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5488.518,5492.78,And then the Philadelphia Court fired them for that alone?
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5492.78,5493.447,That's right.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5493.447,5495.086,You mean the Slochower situation?
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5495.086,5496.302,That's right.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5520.792,5526.108,Your enumeration cases makes it even clearer to mean that we better decide this case.
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5526.108,5531.617,[Laughs] Otherwise Your Honors would be certain to be troubled with more petitions.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5547.863,5550.053,But I didn't say rumors.
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5561.461,5561.501,Right.
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5561.501,5585.237,"And through -- would fix -- he could've laid this worries if the facts were known because the interview, it wouldn't be true that the school is infested by communist or I might give a hypothetical case that all the teachers -- and those teachers in a school in a particular New York district are all members of the (Inaudible) organization."
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5585.237,5592.672,"And I take it, for that purpose, he makes inquiries similar to those made here."
1957.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5602.6,5604.173,"That is, if they have right."
1957.63,2,29625,john_rogers_carroll,,5608.744,5620.12,"I think sir, that your case presents perhaps a little more evidence of pertinency to a legitimate governmental interest than this one."
