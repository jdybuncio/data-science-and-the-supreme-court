1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.923,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-1231 and consolidated with 73-123, Linden Lumber Division against the Labor Board and the Labor Board against the Truck Drivers Union."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,37.501,40.962,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,94.881,97.531,You say the Court left that open.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,102.8,112.292,"Well, the Union had urge a broader position which is the equivalent of their position here and--"
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,112.292,117.257,"But it was outside the scope of the case in controversy then presented to the Court, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,117.257,128.076,"That is correct because, there, there were unfair labor practices which tended to preclude the holding of a fair election."
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,128.076,129.967,And that was the fulcrum of the decision.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,129.967,132.247,That was the fulcrum of the decision.
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,294.905,296.158,"Mr. Come, may I ask--"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,296.158,296.401,Yes.
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,296.401,306.456,"If either employer, in these circumstances, had itsil-- had itself a petition for an election, they would've been entitled to it?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,306.456,308.111,They would've been entitled to petition for--
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,308.111,324.479,"Mr. Come, I think you took-- as I remember, when Gissel was here, the Board told us that its view now was that the employer, even in circumstances like these, was entitled itself to insist upon an election."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,324.479,334.156,"Yes, but the Board also took the position that the employer was no required to petition for an election."
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.997,372.563,And what's the difference of these situations?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,372.563,403.022,"There is no-- the difference here is whether or not, at least as I understand the difference between the parties, the fact that the employer had knowledge independent of the cards that was provided by the picket line showing should be enough to make a difference in the bargaining obligation."
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,403.022,407.747,"You mean the picketing is sort of a demonstrative election, is that the idea?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,407.747,412.205,It reinforces the card showing.
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.205,415.899,"Now, has that always been the Board's position?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,415.899,416.614,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.427,510.874,"So that's when the Board went to the idea that if they wanted to refuse the cards and insist on an election, whether they file their own petition or not, they could do so without committing an unfair labor practice."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,510.874,511.605,That is correct.
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.605,519.126,"Now, when this change is now-- you are now presenting it."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,519.126,538.098,"Now, at the time of Gissel, we pointed out that the Board had abandoned the Joy-Silk Doctrine and had virtually ended up as the Court said in Gissel."
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,721.873,722.616,But--
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,722.616,722.693,Yes.
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.693,727.607,"Really, it comes down to the Board's position that he's entitled, in the absence of committing unfair labor practices."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,729.759,730.226,That is correct.
1974.73-1231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.226,731.823,Doesn't it come down to that?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,731.823,752.634,"That is correct, there is just one exception to that and that is the Snow & Sons situation where the Board says that if the employer waives his right to an election and agrees to be bound by some other means like a poll, he can't renege on that and say that “well, he still wants an election.”"
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.634,764.799,"Well, I take it you're also forced along that line to say that not only is the employer entitled to an election, but he need not file a petition."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,764.799,764.893,That is--
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.893,770.273,"If you made him file a petition, you'd be immediately back in trying to figure out when he has to file a petition."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,770.273,775.025,"That is correct, and that's the difference between the Board and the Court of Appeals."
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.312,798.13,To show good faith.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,798.13,798.987,To show good faith.
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.987,800.396,By filing a petition.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,800.396,808.014,By having the employer file his own petition or express a willingness to consent to a petition filed by--
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.014,814.517,"But that would mean getting right back, again, to figuring out when it is he has to file a petition."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,814.517,831.567,"That is right, Your Honor, and it's for that reason that the Board believes that the Court of Appeals exceeded is reviewing authority here in mandating that the Board had to adopt that-- well, they put the Board in the horns of the dilemma."
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.364,868.631,"Well, there really isn't much-- there really-- Mr. Come, there really isn't much trouble in determining when there's a card majority on the face of things anyway."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,868.631,869.807,"No, there's--"
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.807,878.029,"And if you said “well, if there's a card majority, the employer ought to at least file a petition rather than sit and wait.”"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,881.639,909.543,"Well, we believe that the statute doesn't require-- I mean, conceivably, the Board could go to that position, but we believe that this is an area that Congress left to the Board to determine what is going to be the proper accommodation here."
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.058,912.264,"Well, on the merits of the issue though."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,912.264,912.923,Yes.
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.923,917.901,Is it just a litigation avoidance rationale or what?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,917.901,924.893,"Well, I think that--"
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.893,941.014,"I mean, if there-- it doesn't appear on the face of it to be a whole lot of merit in saying that the-- that an employer, who was faced with a card majority plus a picket line by a majority of the bargaining unit, can just shrug it off and not even file a petition."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,948.023,980.061,"Well, I think the reason is that the-- well, first of all, the-- in adding Section 9 (c) (1) (b) to the statute in 1947, which is the provision that gives the employer the right to file a petition, there is no indication that Congress intended that the employer would have to file a petition to resolve his doubts."
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.546,1056.779,"Well, you're not suggesting, nevertheless, that the Board might not, for reasons dealing with the general administration of the Act, conclude “no, he must file them.”"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1063.781,1067.788,I do not think that the Board would be precluded from doing so.
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.041,1068.671,You did.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1074.236,1076.772,"Well, I think that the Board was reasonable and--"
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.772,1081.364,"If they bargained, there were a-- there was an unfair labor practice."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1081.364,1082.153,Well--
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.153,1090.976,"If he didn't bargain, he'd leave an unfair labor practice under Joy-Silk if there was a part majority or independent knowledge."
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1090.976,1112.679,"That was under the Joy-Silk rule but, having eliminated the Joy-Silk rule, we submit that it is reasonable for the Board to go the whole haul and say that “we're not going to get into the question of good faith or lack of good faith, and the filing of the petition does bear on good faith."
1974.73-1231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1134.209,1140.918,"Mr. Come, is that the mechanical difference between the employer filing the petition and the Union doing so?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1140.918,1141.993,"I believe that it is, Your Honor."
1974.73-1231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1141.993,1145.11,Except the only difference?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1145.11,1146.867,I believe that that is so.
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.382,1200.054,What was the Board doctrine in 1947?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1209.359,1211.334,"Yes, we still had the--"
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.334,1218.419,"Well, wasn't that what Congress was-- they legislated against that background, didn't they?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1218.419,1220.805,They did legislate against that background.
1974.73-1231,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1221.608,1224.128,What year was Joy-Silk?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1224.128,1235.58,"Joy-Silk was, I believe it was, after Taft-Hartley."
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.58,1238.261,"But what did it-- it didn't make a new doctrine, Joy-Silk?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1238.261,1238.784,What's that?
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.784,1240.211,Did Joy-Silk make a new doctrine or was it--
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1240.211,1241.007,No.
1974.73-1231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.007,1245.652,"Reflective of prior-- of stated law, existing law?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1245.652,1247.637,That is correct.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1247.637,1260.18,"Under what circumstances, Mr. Come, is a Union ever-- the employees ever compelled to file petition for an election?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1260.18,1262.694,Under what circumstances is a Union ever compelled?
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.694,1264.192,Yes.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1264.192,1270.876,I think that--
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1270.876,1273.254,They have the right to it.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1273.254,1275.164,They have the right.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.337,1334.661,Another way of saying it is they can't continue the picketing for more than 30 days if they do not file a petition.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1334.661,1334.82,That is--
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.82,1337.02,Isn't that the stress of the Act?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1337.02,1339.505,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1342.45,1343.095,Let me put it another way.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1343.095,1343.642,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1343.642,1347.248,Why does the Union always want the employer to petition?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1353.933,1355.25,I think that that is so.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.262,1508.319,You indicated earlier that the Board tends to discount pressures of picketing for recognition because of the bandwagon aspect.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1516.263,1521.929,"I would say that it, certainly, likely to be as much."
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1521.929,1522.842,"At least as much, was it not?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1522.842,1524.637,At least as much.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.637,1531.21,"The documentary aspect of it is very forceful psychologically, isn't it?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1531.21,1532.963,Right.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1532.963,1539.222,Has the Board ever indicated that in any affirmative way?
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1539.222,1551.24,"Well, I think they've indicated it in their statements that election is a more reliable means of ascertaining--"
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1551.24,1552.944,"So, it's a secret ballot?"
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1552.944,1553.487,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.487,1561.629,And the bandwagon aspect of either crowding people into a picket line or pressing cards on them isn't present in the balloting.
1974.73-1231,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1561.629,1569.554,And the picket line has the added problems since 8 (b) (7) has been added to the statute in 1959.
1974.73-1231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.803,1606.496,"Thank you, Mr. Come."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1607.868,1611.103,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1767.538,1771.784,"I gather, Mr. Cohen, this argument suggest that Joy-Silk were wrongly decided by the Board."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1771.784,1809.105,"No, I think that Joy-- the question really is, in Joy-Silk there were unfair labor practices, the question that's really before the Court is a gloss on the Joy-Silk Doctrine in a sense of whether where there are no unfair labor practices standing alone, the so-called Snow & Sons independent knowledge question, if in Joy-Silk there were unfair labor practices and the Board, at all times after 1947 with the exception of the renege type situation that Mr.-- which was actually Snow & Sons that Mr. Come alluded to, except for that kind of renege exception, the Board uniformly did ever issue bargaining orders where there was no unfair labor practices."
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.886,1960.721,When you say precluded it--
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1960.721,1960.867,Excuse me.
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.867,1963.83,You include interfering with it.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1963.83,1964.019,Yes.
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.019,1964.685,I am fairly--
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1964.685,1965.445,Two alternatives.
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.278,1989.458,"The interference in that sense is an affirmative act, is it not?"
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1989.458,2000.97,"It's an affirmative act of the employer that requires resort to secondary evidence because the primary evidence of the election is not available, and I think this is-- this points out another anomaly in the Union's position."
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2122.063,2126.181,"Well, your earlier argument, Mr. Cohen, suggests the Board couldn't return to good faith doubt."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2126.181,2133.8,"That's-- we said the Board-- no, what we've suggested is that the Board could not require an employer to file an election petition."
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2133.8,2136.107,That wasn't what I suggested.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2144.768,2145.487,That's our position.
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2145.487,2147.175,That's where you have to read the statute.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2147.175,2147.696,That's what we would do.
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2147.696,2158.098,"If that's so, in an instance where there were no unfair labor practices the Board, as a matter of statutory construction, I thought you were suggesting, could not return to Joy-Silk."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2158.098,2158.517,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2158.517,2159.077,Isn't that right?
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2159.077,2159.304,That's correct.
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2159.304,2160.234,The good faith test.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2160.234,2165.63,"That's correct, and I think there's-- all I'm trying to point out, Mr. Justice Brennan, was that there are some policy reasons for the Board not doing so."
1974.73-1231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2165.63,2167.117,Yes.
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2167.117,2180.13,I suppose the policy reasons would be somewhat similar to the reasons why the-- you would consider that the Board had no authority to force the Union to demand an election.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2180.13,2180.749,That's correct.
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.645,2374.801,"Mr. Cohen, right along that line, I'm-- I still am a little unclear of what-- as to what your position is with respect to the state of the law at the time of the 1947 Act."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2389.314,2401.568,"I think there were some language in cases prior to Taft-Hartley, the Dahlstrom case, other case that the Union talks about where they imply that a bargaining could-- order could issue if there were no unfair labor practices."
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.568,2405.998,"Now, you said a while ago that there's never been an instance there--"
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2405.998,2409.553,Since 1947 was my position that there has been no c--
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.553,2411.087,But were there before it?
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2411.087,2416.553,"There was no-- there were cases which had the language, but there were no case in which the Board imposed such an order."
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.553,2424.595,But if somebody asks-- if someone knowledgeable in labor law ask-- was asked could a bargaining order issue--
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2424.595,2425.801,I think that it was--
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.801,2430.491,"Absent of good faith doubt and absent of unfair labor practices, you'd say yes."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2430.491,2432.2,We're talking about the time of Taft-Hartley.
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.321,2439.36,"Well, then, you do think--"
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2439.36,2442.234,I don't think there was any Board case that came out saying so.
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.234,2448.641,Do you think that Taft-Hartley Act-- that after Taft-Hartley you would answer no?
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2448.641,2450.211,"That's correct, and I think--"
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.211,2452.983,"Now, what specific provision do you say changes the law?"
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2452.983,2454.119,What provision changed?
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.636,2460.951,Because it didn't-- it doesn't--
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2460.951,2462.802,The whole change in professional objective.
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.802,2466.093,It doesn't sound to me like the Board would agree-- the Board agreed with you.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2466.093,2466.198,Well--
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.198,2468.859,It didn't agree with you then and it doesn't apparently agree with you today.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2468.859,2473.87,"The significant fact is, since 1947, the Board recognized a change in direction."
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.602,2490.711,That isn't the way the Board described Joy-Silk to us today.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2490.711,2494.311,"Well, it's the way the Board attempted to describe Joy-Silk in Aaron Brothers."
1974.73-1231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.311,2494.713,That's right.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2494.713,2497.947,And the way it clearly described Joy-Silk when it got to Gissel.
1974.73-1231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2501.635,2508.728,"Really, Mr. Cohen, all you need to argue here is that the Board's present position is a perfectly permissible one under the existing statute."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2508.728,2509.37,That's correct.
1974.73-1231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2509.37,2509.953,Isn't it?
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2509.953,2510.831,That's correct.
1974.73-1231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.311,2512.793,You don't need--
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2512.793,2513.363,But I don't have to go s--
1974.73-1231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2513.363,2516.505,You don't need to argue it's the only required one.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2516.505,2516.815,I don't have to argue that.
1974.73-1231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2517.02,2522.907,"You have to say it's perfectly permissible under the statute, and your opponents have to say “no, it's not even permissible.”"
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2522.907,2523.026,That's correct.
1974.73-1231,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.026,2524.539,Their position is required.
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2524.539,2525.567,That's correct.
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2526.263,2536.176,"Mr. Cohen, let me read you just one sentence of the Court of Appeals opinion and see what your reaction is to that."
1974.73-1231,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,2563.783,2565.741,I think the second part of the sentence is the error.
1974.73-1231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2587.226,2588.681,Mr. Gold.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2588.681,2591.917,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2720.821,2725.315,"Mr. Gold, isn't this an argument beyond-- you didn't cross-petition, did you?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2725.315,2726.742,No.
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2726.742,2729.357,Desn't this go beyond what the Court of Appeals did?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2729.357,2729.949,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2731.287,2733.818,"Are you supporting the Court of Appeals' judgment, aren't you?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2733.818,2742.944,"Well, we're supporting the Court of Appeals' judgment understanding what the Court of Appeals' judgment is or our understanding of what the Court of Appeals' judgment is."
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.505,2888.763,"You don't think the Court of Appeals said as long as the employer files, he can escape an unfair labor practice charge?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2888.763,2898.171,"I think the Court of Appeals said that it would validate such a rule if the Board adopted it, but it did not say that the Board had to adopt it."
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.171,2912.679,"Let's assume the Board did adopt the rule that, absent other unfair labor practices, absent agreement, there's no reason to bar it as long as the-- until and unless there is a certification after an employer's request of an election."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2914.476,2914.785,Yes.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.785,2915.698,You would not.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2915.698,2916.542,Right.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.542,2917.175,You would not.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2917.175,2918.498,We would not accept that.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.498,2923.466,"And, in that sense, you are saying that you're disagreeing with the Court of Appeals."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2923.466,2931.711,"Well, the Court of Appeals said-- implied that it would but, in this c-- let me say, in this case, there were no employer petitions."
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2955.671,2957.868,I'm surprised you didn't cross-petition on this.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2957.868,2975.28,"Well, our view on why we-- quite frankly, we did not cross-petition so that we could find out the answer to the underlying question before we got to what we regard as the secondary question, the secondary question being under what circumstances an employer has a duty."
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3070.304,3086.235,"Well, aren't you converting an option into an obligation by this argument that you're making, the option that's been extended to an employer as it is extended to the workman to call for an election?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3091.018,3094.673,"Well, first of all, in practical terms, the Union doesn't have an option."
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.678,3117.468,"I'm speaking in terms of the option, the option to seek an election."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3124.92,3125.314,"Well, we don't agree with that."
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3125.314,3149.512,"But if they're not exercised-- up to now, has it not been thought clear that the Union has an option at its choice to call for an election and if the employer has an option to call for an election and that neither one is compelled to do so, is that not so?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3149.512,3162.564,"Well, I don't think that it has ever been the law that an employer has an option, it's-- it has never been the law, so far as I know that an employer has an option no matter what the circumstance is to cal for an election."
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.564,3182.148,"Well, wasn't Gissel-- the holding of the Court in Gissel regarded as a departure in the sense that it said that the option of the employer is lost in circumstances where the employer has done something to interfere with the probability of a free choice."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3184.31,3195.303,"Well, that is the essence of the Gissel holding, but it is not a departure, as we understand it, from anything that was the law starting with the day after the Wagner Act was passed."
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.303,3199.858,You didn't think Gissel-- the Gissel holding startled anyone?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3199.858,3205.084,Not in terms of the obligations that imposed on employers.
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.996,3220.166,"Bargain on what, on everything?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3220.166,3221.07,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1231,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3566.947,3569.232,But what did you say the proposed amendment was?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3569.232,3608.888,"The proposed amendment is reproduced on page 15 of our brief, the rust-colored brief, and the House proposed to amend Section 8 (a) (5) and 9 (a) which, as I've indicated, together impose a duty to represent the-- I mean, to recognize the representative designated or selected with an obligation imposed on employers to fail to bargain with a Union currently recognized by that employer or certified as such through an election under Section 9."
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3738.885,3749.211,You wouldn't think that would be satisfied by a rule that the employer could always refuse to bargain as long as sought an election?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3749.211,3760.833,"No, our view, Mr. Justice White, is that, once again, the statute addresses itself directly to that question."
1974.73-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3877.339,3886.424,"Mr. Gold, you referred to the law between 1935 and 1947 to the Dahlstrom case which enforced a Board order, I believe."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3895.624,3922.17,"I don't see how the Board could've taken another view, but I do think that if the Board had taken another view between 1935 and 1947 and if we had the same sequence of events and a 1947 determination by the Conference Committee to follow the law as it stood, that that might stand up now."
1974.73-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3951.623,3953.883,Do you think Congress froze it then in 1947?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3953.883,3958.307,"To that extent, to the extent of the outline."
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3981.233,3989.508,"Well, Mr. Gold, if the Board were to address it and were to say “nothing's convincing except the result of an election,” could they do that?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3989.508,3992.046,"That, we think, is the one option which was removed."
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3993.075,3994.916,That's what I thought.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3994.916,3996.095,Into the law.
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3996.095,3996.815,Exactly.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3996.815,4001.557,"We don't see how, in light of the pr-- the 1935-1947 law and what happened--"
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4001.557,4009.197,"So, whatever the definition of convincing evidence that the Board, as you suggest, may fashion, it can include that."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4009.197,4009.846,That's right.
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4009.846,4012.586,There's got to be some other chip types of convincing evidence.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4012.586,4013.101,That's right.
1974.73-1231,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4020.674,4021.586,Would be certification.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4021.586,4023.238,Would be certification.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4029.676,4042.625,"Mr. Gold, do you read the Gissel as-- do you think that the Court-- this Court acquiesced in the Board's abandonment of the good faith test in Gissel?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4042.625,4043.417,Your Honor--
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4043.417,4046.679,"And if we did, I take it you think we made a mistake."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4046.679,4052.252,"Well, I am perfectly convinced that you did not acquiesce.[Laughter]"
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4097.837,4099.662,What page of the original opinion is the other jump site?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4099.662,4105.175,That is 395 US at 579.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4119.081,4129.828,"But didn't the opinion, or didn't it, pretty clearly indicate that, absent unfair labor practices, the Board-- that the employer could petition for an election and not have to bargain?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4129.828,4130.479,I do not--
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4130.479,4131.187,You don't think so?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4131.187,4133.618,Believe that it did.
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4316.347,4320.433,What do you think the Court meant in the Gissel case?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4338.536,4344.559,"That was the passage I was referring to, Mr. Chief Justice, discussion-- discussing--"
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4344.559,4346.577,What do you think the Gissel Court meant by that?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4346.577,4354.48,"I say, that was the passage I was discussing a moment ago where the Court was discussing 9 (c) (1) (b)."
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4390.235,4393.199,"Well, to save time, I had read only the latter part of it."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4408.985,4409.164,"That's right, because--"
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4409.164,4412.929,"And then going on, “for an employer can insist on a secret ballot.”"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4412.929,4413.274,That is--
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4413.274,4418.144,Isn't that what is unequivocal to a holding of the Court as you could find?
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4418.144,4420.115,I don't think it's a holding.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4556.737,4572.086,"At least there's nothing in Gissel, I take it, suggesting that even if the employer has the right to file, that he has to, or that he can just sit and wait for somebody else."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4572.086,4572.716,That's right.
1974.73-1231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4572.716,4575.498,He might have the right to file without bargaining.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4575.498,4575.91,That's right.
1974.73-1231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4613.143,4614.759,"By file, you mean petition under--"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4614.759,4616.353,"Yes, petition, to file a petition."
1974.73-1231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4616.353,4618.22,Under 9 (c) (1) (b).
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4618.22,4619.634,Right.
1974.73-1231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4631.838,4631.931,"So, y--"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4631.931,4635.491,He has no affirmative obligations under Section 8 (a) (5).
1974.73-1231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4635.491,4651.598,"Even if the language from Gissel could be read as literally and as strongly and as much of a holding in that case, as had been suggested, the most it would mean that the Board can insist that the employer avail himself of 9 (c) (1) (b)."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4651.598,4652.059,That's right.
1974.73-1231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4652.059,4653.345,Not that he'd wait for the--
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4653.345,4654.892,That's right.
1974.73-1231,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4654.892,4655.054,Union to petition.
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4655.054,4665.928,"Yes, sir, and I believe that would be the most, and as I say, that is not the Board's position nor is it the position of the employer."
1974.73-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5076.483,5081.151,"Well, you say employer free choice, but the Union can petition for an election."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,5081.376,5083.56,"Well, it's employer free choice."
1974.73-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5092.199,5102.701,"Well, but you-- when you say employer free choice, you give the impression that the decision is solely in the hands of the employer but the Union, if it petitions for an election, takes the play away from the employer."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,5102.701,5105.857,"Yes, but the employer has everything to gain by that play."
1974.73-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5132.015,5133.979,"Well, then why can't the Union petition for an election?"
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,5135.505,5147.266,"It doesn't solve their problems, as I'm starting to say, in that it takes a long time and gives the employer all sorts of options to delay bargaining and--"
1974.73-1231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5147.266,5153.313,"Well, then your real criticism isn't that it gives employer free choice, but that you don't like elections."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,5153.313,5157.24,No.
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5340.668,5342.927,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1974.73-1231,2,34498,laurence_gold,,5349.313,5351.458,Just two points.
1974.73-1231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5364.857,5368.407,"Well, some of us are.[Laughter]"
1974.73-1231,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5368.407,5382.546,"At page 591 of the Court's opinion in Gissel, the Court describes the Board's current practice as follows."
1974.73-1231,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5499.628,5502.674,"Well, did that reach independent knowledge?"
1974.73-1231,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5502.674,5505.32,"No, it did not reach independent knowledge."
1974.73-1231,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5705.238,5707.301,"Thank you very much, Mr. Come."
