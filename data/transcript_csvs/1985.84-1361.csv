1985.84-1361,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.2,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Kenneth Moses Loud Hawk.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,13.964,24.773,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the defendants in this case were apprehended in November, 1975, illegally transporting dynamite and firearms."
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,190.708,193.488,Does that mean that they could have left the country?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,193.488,201.454,"During the second appeal, as far as I am aware, they were not under travel restrictions, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,201.454,201.892,Of any kind?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,201.892,202.891,Of any kind.
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.891,206.515,Was that different for the first?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,206.515,208.248,"No, it is not."
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.45,220.399,What constraints are possible to be imposed on a defendant when the indictment is involuntarily dismissed?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,220.399,222.274,The defendant can be incarcerated.
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.408,360.764,How much time did it take the judge to dispose of those three motions?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,360.764,363.045,I am not sure.
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.498,367.465,"You are suggesting they were obviously frivolous, I take it."
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,367.465,368.34,"--I am, and--"
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.34,371.495,"Well, then, if they were, it wouldn't really take much time to decide them, would it?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,371.495,383.412,"--It would not take much time to decide motions such as those, Justice Stevens, but the point that I would like to make is that they have been using these motions in an attempt to avoid trial, and I would like to point to two motions, two filings in particular."
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.673,401.078,"Yes, but compare that with the time the case was pending in the Court of Appeals."
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,404.372,427.035,"--Several years have passed while the case was in the Court of Appeals, but I think that the defendant's motion practice clearly indicates that what they wanted was not a speedy trial, but to avoid trial, Justice Stevens, and indeed I would like to focus, perhaps most telling of all, on the motion that is the subject of this Court's review now, and that is their speedy trial motion."
1985.84-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.725,466.957,"What about the delay, that long delay in the Court of Appeals on the... when they were proceeding en banc in the first appeal?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,472.064,500.224,"--It can be, Justice Rehnquist, but not under these circumstances, and I would point out that the delay on the first appeal before the Court of Appeals was something in the neighborhood of three years, and this entailed briefing an argument before a panel of the Court of Appeals, a divided panel decision, rehearing en banc, a remand to the District Court for further factfinding, and the issuance of a number of opinions that take up more than 50 pages in the appendix to the petition."
1985.84-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.224,503.613,I think nonlawyers would think that three years was an awfully long time.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,503.613,511.532,"It was a long time, Justice Rehnquist, but I would suggest that it is not a completely unreasonable amount of time, given--"
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,511.532,522.387,"Well, Mr. Kuhlik, why shouldn't that at least be one of the considerations that should be weighed under the Barker v. Wingo factors rather than some automatically excluded period of time?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,522.387,531.102,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, we don't contend that time on appeal should under all circumstances be excluded under Barker versus Wingo, but under--"
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.102,541.988,"Why doesn't it make sense to just always consider it, because after all, the appellate court is an arm of government just like the trial court, and why shouldn't it just go into the factors?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,541.988,569.711,"--The problem, Justice O'Connor, is that time on appeal necessarily is going to be of greater length than is time in the District Court, and it will be more routinely justifiable, and when you plug that into the test that the lower courts have developed under Barker, which generally entails a finding of presumptive prejudice after anywhere from six months to a year to a little more than that, you are inevitably going to skew the balance, and that is exactly what happened here."
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.536,581.316,But why aren't the concerns basically the same?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,609.102,624.892,"--Justice Blackmun, the government filed its appeals on an expedited basis under the Court of Appeals rules, but I would note that the defendants did not do anything either while the cases were pending, and I would think it would be incumbent upon them--"
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,624.892,626.892,So your answer is in the negative.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,626.892,627.142,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,627.142,634.014,What I am trying to do is to tie this into Justice O'Connor's question of isn't it a factor to consider in the Barker and Wingo balance?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,672.795,676.028,"District Courts, of course, have different functions, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,806.726,809.32,"Yes, but certainly McDonald is distinguishable, isn't it?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,809.32,816.363,"We believe the principle of McDonald, the guiding principle, Justice Blackmun, is that once the indictment has been dismissed--"
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,816.363,820.394,That was a voluntary dismissal by the government.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,820.394,821.564,--I don't believe--
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,821.564,822.642,Here is an involuntary one.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,822.642,824.532,--I don't believe that that is quite accurate.
1985.84-1361,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.716,884.976,"When an indictment is dismissed, as it was in this case, is the defendant then completely free or isn't he still being held to answer a criminal charge?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,884.976,887.428,In this case he is not being... the defendants were not being--
1985.84-1361,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.428,889.007,Could you have rearrested him?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,889.007,891.474,"--We could have arrested, and we could have--"
1985.84-1361,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.474,896.863,Was that... a little while ago you said that he could have been put on bail.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,896.863,897.769,"--That is right, Justice White."
1985.84-1361,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.769,903.313,How can you put him on bail if he isn't... unless he is being held to answer for a criminal charge?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,903.313,907.155,"If he is put on bail, than he is held to answer."
1985.84-1361,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.858,908.795,"Well, how do you put him on bail?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,909.42,914.73,"--I believe that is what would be done, or required him to appear before the Judge."
1985.84-1361,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.668,915.996,"Well, I--"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,923.227,924.102,--He was not under arrest.
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,946.171,947.937,--But at least there is an appeal pending.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,947.937,949.419,--There is an appeal pending.
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,949.419,951.793,Which was not true in McDonald.
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,951.793,955.621,"That is true, Justice Blackmun, but I am not sure that the distinction makes any difference."
1985.84-1361,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,956.011,960.353,"Well, to use your misused word, I don't think it is viable."
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,960.353,990.184,"--Had the indictment been dismissed on some technicality in terms of the indictment process itself, the government would have had the choice of returning to the grand jury and seeking a new indictment, in which case, under McDonald, the speedy trial clause indisputably would not have applied, but going to the Court of Appeals and seeking reinstatement of the old one, we do not think that there is any functional difference between those two courses of action for purposes of the speedy trial clause."
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.275,999.915,May I just get one thing clear in my own mind?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1007.085,1008.38,"--Yes, he would, Justice--"
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.38,1009.755,Which he would not have had in McDonald?
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1009.755,1010.785,--That is true.
1985.84-1361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.785,1015.581,"So your argument is that unless he actually imposes the restraint, you should not count the time at all."
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1015.581,1020.359,"That is my argument, and I believe that is a fair reading of the Court's cases, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1020.359,1028.559,"What would the Court do if just some minor restraint were imposed, you can't leave the country, or you can't leave the state, or something like that?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1035.635,1046.349,"No, I think, Justice O'Connor, once any sort of restraint has been imposed to hold the defendant to answer a criminal charge, that that would trigger the speedy trial clause's applicability under--"
1985.84-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1046.349,1049.159,"Any restraint, no matter how small?"
1985.84-1361,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1049.159,1055.923,"--I believe that that is the result of this Court's decision in Dillingham, in which the defendant was released."
1985.84-1361,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1121.226,1128.286,Mr. Stern.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1128.286,1139.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it was nine years and 363 days ago that this case began, and it has been pending in the federal courts ever since."
1985.84-1361,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1141.844,1146.499,Do you think the accused persons had anything to do with that?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1146.499,1153.529,"--Your Honor, the facts of this case show that these accused people were ready for trial on May 12th, 1976."
1985.84-1361,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.71,1167.35,"What has that got to do with what has happened after that, after the new indictment?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1167.35,1184.999,"--Well, after the new indictment, there was a government appeal and a defense appeal, and that consumed time also, but the real result in this case is that we were ready for trial back in 1976, and the government was not, and that was the Act that gave all the resulting delay."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1251.627,1253.721,"Mr. Stern, may I ask you a question?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1253.721,1255.095,"Certainly, Justice Powell."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1255.095,1271.464,"Let's assume that for this case in the long process you are discussing had been appealed to this Court and argued in October, and we finally brought a decision down on the 30th of June."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1272.479,1280.694,"I think that there... under the Barker test, a District Court judge is going to make the determination can--"
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1280.694,1286.13,A District Court judge would decide what part of that time we were delaying and should have brought the case down--
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1286.13,1294.955,"--I think a District Court judge would say that there is a valid reason for the delay of a case in front of this court, and that that amount of time, I would submit, is appropriate."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1294.955,1299.452,--Would the District Court have to make that inquiry if we delayed it for two months?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1299.452,1301.373,I don't think that that type of--
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1301.373,1301.842,Or six?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1301.842,1307.215,"--I think when you get to the point of a delay in this case, which is sometimes one part almost two years--"
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1307.215,1309.402,You are asking us to lay down a general standard.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1309.402,1309.731,--Right.
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1328.862,1331.674,And every defendant would ask that that be done.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1331.674,1342.435,"No, I think if there was a circumstance with more than enough delay to raise the issue, District Court judges would weigh that delay in the particular case and that particular circumstance."
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1342.435,1358.96,"Mr. Stern, either you are putting District Judge... Judge Burns or whoever it was in a very awkward position to have them say in adjudicating a speedy trial motion that the Court of Appeals which regularly reviews their decision took too long to decide this case."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1358.96,1366.924,"I think it is a hard decision to make in some close cases, but I think in a case like this where you have had two appeals in some six and half years, it isn't so hard."
1985.84-1361,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1366.924,1371.564,Do you suppose the District Court could mandate the Court of Appeals to get on with the business?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1371.564,1377.53,I think the ruling from... the holding from this Court hopefully will make it so that it need not happen.
1985.84-1361,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1392.883,1401.802,"Mr. Stern, the government attempted to expedite the appeal on the vindictive prosecution aspect, didn't it?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1401.802,1405.722,"What happened under the Ninth Circuit rule is, anything that the government did--"
1985.84-1361,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1405.722,1406.691,Did it not?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1406.691,1407.784,"--No, the rule did, Your Honor."
1985.84-1361,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1424.418,1426.589,"My real question is, did you oppose that?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1426.589,1427.37,"--No, we didn't."
1985.84-1361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1445.035,1464.106,"There is an indication, is there not, in the record that there were a number of instances in which counsel for the defendants below indicated less than a sincere desire to push on for trial."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1481.551,1482.083,"Justice O'Connor, let me take a minute and--"
1985.84-1361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.083,1486.409,Because it doesn't look too sincere at times and in places in the record.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1486.409,1493.594,"--Let me take a couple of minutes and try to put you in the picture where this case was in 1976, and you can see that the record is otherwise."
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.871,1585.323,"What was the government's reason, that they wanted to appeal the suppression?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1585.323,1591.351,"They wanted to appeal the suppressed evidence not only as to the three counts, but also as to the two remaining counts."
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.802,1608.204,"Well, but maybe if you are demanding a speedy trial on counts that aren't affected by the suppression order, maybe you have a duty to move to set."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1608.204,1609.345,I don't think so.
1985.84-1361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.293,1676.99,Is the government's attorney correct that if you should lose in this case before this Court that then there would be an intention to file a motion for another speedy trial violation because of the time taken by this Court?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1676.99,1677.365,No.
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.209,1762.783,"What about the government's position that if you file a number of pretrial motions, you are in effect opening the way for very likely appeals pretrial?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1762.783,1782.384,"I think the difference between the government's position and ours is, the government is saying, once you start the ball in motion, you can't complain about all the delay that happens thereafter, and what we are saying is that under Barker-Wingo a judge should be able to realize that a valid reason for delay justifies appropriate delay, not endless delay, appropriate delay."
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.692,1799.581,"And where is the unreasonable delay here, in your view, in the appellate process?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1799.581,1799.769,Okay.
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.105,1824.413,"Well, do you just want them together kind of en bloc that way and say that two appeals divided into six and a half years means three and a quarter years per appeal, and that is too much?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1824.413,1826.538,"No, I think the circuit senses of each have to be looked at."
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.378,1883.796,"Of course, you filed the motions, and they were ruled on by the District Court, and the government thought they were erroneously ruled--"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1883.796,1884.077,--Correct.
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.077,1885.359,--And they were.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1885.359,1886.826,Excuse me?
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.388,1887.888,They were.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1887.888,1889.732,"Well, not--"
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.732,1897.197,"They were, so at least it could be said that you talked the District Court into error."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1897.197,1900.305,"--Well, it could be said, but I think--"
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.305,1901.851,"Well, it proved out that the court was wrong."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1901.851,1905.975,"--But the point is that either side has a right to exercise certain rights in the proceeding, and that--"
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.975,1910.176,"Exactly, and the government has a right to appeal a ruling that it thinks erroneous."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1910.176,1913.44,"--That's right, and I think a reasonable time is permissible."
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.564,1917.736,How long?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,1917.736,1919.111,--I don't think we could set a standard.
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.427,2030.066,"Well, how do you define a pending case?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2034.533,2043.25,"Well, our definition includes a time not only when we feel that we have been defending our clients against a government prosecution, but Congress has determined that."
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.284,2074.564,Was that after the reversal of the dismissal?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2074.564,2075.954,--That was while the case was still dismissed.
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.313,2201.496,"Was the reason they wanted to continue was, they felt that the suppression order was damaging to their case, and that they have a right to appeal it."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2201.496,2209.292,"--That is correct, but the reason they refused to proceed was because they felt that the evidence that was suppressed would be helpful for the remaining counts."
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.644,2226.706,But the Ninth Circuit reversed that determination.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2226.706,2230.502,The Ninth Circuit reversed the determination because the judge gave no forewarning.
1985.84-1361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.431,2248.728,But as to the other counts--
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2248.728,2250.446,"--As to the other counts, that is correct."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2347.064,2349.875,"--Mr. Stern, will you refresh my recollection please--"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2349.875,2350.235,Sure.
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2350.235,2359.622,--as to when the defendants requested on the record that the trial be proceeded with?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2359.622,2362.807,They requested... the circumstances--
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2362.807,2365.151,When did they first make a request for a speedy trial?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2365.151,2371.866,--The government came in in mid-April and said--
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2371.866,2372.6,Of what year?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2372.6,2374.069,--Of 1976.
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2374.069,2374.442,Yes.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2374.442,2386.266,"And they said... what happened is, it was a switch of prosecutors, because they thought that they might have the case on appeal, and it might not go, and they might ask for a continuance, so they shifted prosecutors, and this was on April 13th, actually."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2417.801,2419.722,And what happened then?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2419.722,2426.891,"What happened then is that the next hearing... well, they filed a motion for a continuance."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2463.891,2466.609,Were there further motions on the record for a speedy trial?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2466.609,2492.629,"The motions for speedy trial or the requests for speedy trial when the government was requesting continuances were all on the record, open court, as a matter of fact, including up to the day of trial, when we stood demanding our trial, and the government said we refuse to proceed, and thereafter, too, I might point out that at the future time, too, in 1983, on the March 9th, 1983, transcript, on Pages 2 through 18, it reflects again this case came--"
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2492.629,2496.675,They always want a speedy trial when they have had a case pending on appeal?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2496.675,2499.22,"--We have always wanted a speedy trial, yes."
1985.84-1361,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2499.22,2504.984,When they... primarily because they had a case pending on appeal in the Ninth Circuit?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2504.984,2509.592,"When the case was pending in front of the Ninth Circuit, we still obviously wanted a speedy trial."
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.647,2570.848,Is there a federal Speedy Trial Act?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2570.848,2575.908,"There is a Speedy Trial Act, but it does not address the delay in the appellate system."
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.908,2580.11,"Well, how doesn't it?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2580.11,2582.327,It excludes the time--
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.327,2584.249,"Well, why do you suppose it excludes it?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2584.249,2589.575,--I suspect that Act was promulgated to speed up the proceedings in the District Court.
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.575,2595.073,"Well, Congress didn't think that they ought to subject the appellate time to the Speedy Trial Act."
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2595.073,2597.76,"I don't know if that is true, but if it is--"
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.76,2598.883,"Well, it doesn't apply, does it?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2598.883,2599.977,"--It doesn't apply, but--"
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.977,2601.524,"And it is expressly excluded, isn't it?"
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2601.524,2602.976,--It is expressly excluded.
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.976,2604.289,Why do you suppose that is?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2604.289,2612.223,"I suspect because they were addressing themselves to the District Court rather than to the appellate system, and I think that the Congress certainly could."
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.767,2622.733,But you think that we ought to on a constitutional basis do what Congress has expressly not done.
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2622.733,2628.341,"--I think it is up to this Court to rule whether appellate delay can violate its right to a speedy trial, yes."
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.105,2636.541,Do you think we ought to take into consideration the fact that Congress has not seen fit to impose the Speedy Trial Act on appellate time?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2636.541,2639.087,--I don't think that that is relevant one way or another.
1985.84-1361,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.863,2651.723,Have you looked at the legislative history?
1985.84-1361,1,33980,kenneth_saul_stern,,2651.723,2652.051,"--Oh, I know."
1985.84-1361,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2672.089,2675.697,Mr. Kuhlik.
1985.84-1361,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2675.697,2677.01,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.144,2732.112,"Mr. Kuhlik, can I just interrupt for one factual question?"
1985.84-1361,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2736.064,2739.797,--The dynamite had been destroyed by state officials who had custody of it.
1985.84-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.797,2740.953,What exactly was suppressed?
1985.84-1361,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2740.953,2742.389,Secondary evidence of the dynamite.
1985.84-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.389,2742.827,"Oh, I see."
1985.84-1361,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2742.827,2743.779,There were photographs of it and the like.
1985.84-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.967,2823.67,"Mr. Kuhlik, can I ask you to address just one more point?"
1985.84-1361,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2847.191,2856.842,"I think you are going to have a real problem with general significance, Justice Stevens, if you affirm the manner in which the Court of Appeals in this case undertook the balancing test."
1985.84-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.135,2878.21,"Well, that goes to the question of whether they properly counted the time, but you are... you are sticking with your argument, though, that even the D.C. Court of Appeals rule was quit wrong?"
1985.84-1361,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,2878.21,2881.052,"--We do believe it is incorrect, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1361,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2990.711,2992.084,Very well.
