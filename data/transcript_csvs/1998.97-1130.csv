1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,98.765,99.807,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.807,106.822,--do you think that an invention has to be reduced to practice in order to get a patent?
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,106.822,112.335,"An invention has to be reduced to practice... the answer is yes, Your Honor, either through--"
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.335,112.635,Yes?
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,141.414,158.975,"--The Court in Dolbear recognized that one could have a constructive reduction to practice by the filing of a patent application that met the standards of disclosure in 112 in novelty, in 102 in nonobviousness, in 103--"
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.975,159.676,"Well, don't complicate it."
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,166.529,167.09,--Yes.
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.09,167.571,--in the patent?
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,167.571,168.622,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.622,179.789,"Now, was the socket here sufficiently described that a patent could have been obtained before it was physically produced?"
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,179.789,182.611,"The... the answer is yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.673,188.594,Why shouldn't it turn on patentability rather than reduction to practice?
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,188.594,196.248,"--The reason it should not, Your Honor, is because the statute says the invention was on sale."
1998.97-1130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.663,274.099,"Well, but I agree with the inference at least I draw from Justice O'Connor's question, if there is enough information to secure a patent, and if he finds a willing buyer for 30,000 units, what purpose is served by adding the arbitrary requirement that it be reduced to practice, other than to extend the 17 year period plus 1?"
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,279.686,280.554,"Well, to--"
1998.97-1130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.554,282.297,Other than to extend the life of the patent.
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,282.297,304.313,"--Well, to understand the purpose I think we need to go back briefly through the history, Your Honor, and the Patent Act of 1793 as construed by this Court in Pennock v. Dialogue provided no grace period in that an application had to be filed before there was public use or public sale for use."
1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.847,342.499,"Well, why isn't it clear?"
1998.97-1130,0,33146,jerry_r_selinger,,349.853,354.965,"Well, Your Honor, when you have a conception, you have a piece of paper--"

1998.97-1130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.769,376.811,No?
