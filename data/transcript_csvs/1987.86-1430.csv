1987.86-1430,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,50.044,"Mr. Schimmel, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,50.044,54.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1430,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.931,135.993,"Mr. Schimmel,--"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,135.993,136.478,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.478,149.674,"--I understand your opponents in this case to contend that Texas does provide relief from this sort of judgment and certainly from execution on it, but that you simply have taken the wrong procedural tact."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,149.674,152.954,"Well, to begin with, they are improper in their statement of the law."
1987.86-1430,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.659,202.998,"Well, again, I had thought that, at least one of your opponents contended, that had you followed the proper Texas procedure, you could have ended up with a new trial rather than just having to produce a meritorious defense."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,202.998,203.825,"No, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.951,241.904,"To solve that, we don't have to strike down the whole rule."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,247.152,249.589,"--No, sir, because--"
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.589,252.197,"Because if there is collateral attack, the rule makes a lot of sense to me."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,253.791,256.289,"--To begin with, there's not collateral attack, and--"
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.289,259.382,"I understand, but if there were, would you still say the rule was no good?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,259.382,261.24,"--Yes, sir, I would, and let me tell you why, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.691,309.315,"Wait until you're harmed, like everybody else."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,309.315,310.783,"Well, we're harmed."
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.783,314.422,"Your only immediate harm, as I understand it, is going to be your credit rating."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,315.234,317.234,"No, sir, that is not our only immediate harm."
1987.86-1430,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.448,337.663,"--Mr. Schimmel, doesn't Paul v. Davis suggest there's no liberty interest in reputation alone?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,337.663,338.913,"No, ma'am."
1987.86-1430,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.239,381.895,"Mr. Schimmel, let me ask you something else."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,391.439,393.874,"--No, ma'am, and the reason is quite clear."
1987.86-1430,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.612,425.424,"Well, let me ask you this."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,434.843,461.004,"In actuality, it would not, and the reason would be because although we would be able to get a temporary injunction during the pendency of the collateral attack, because the collateral attack would have to fail as a result of the recitation of the judgment, at the end of that pendency, the injunction would be vacated, and then they would be open to taking our property again and doing all these other things to us."
1987.86-1430,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.456,466.939,"Well, aren't you... don't you have some proceedings going on right now?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,466.939,467.814,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.25,472.031,"Well, you aren't taking them just for exercise, are you?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,472.031,477.7,"--No, sir, we are not, and I think that it needs to be made clear to the Court why we are taking these other proceedings."
1987.86-1430,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.313,509.718,"So, what are you... what proceedings do you have going on?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,509.718,512.842,"--Well, that is what we call trespass to try title in order to get--"
1987.86-1430,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.842,513.92,What if you win that?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,513.92,517.809,"--If we win that, that will not... well, first of all, we can't win that with this judgment."
1987.86-1430,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.809,518.638,"Well, why did you bring it?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,518.638,528.259,"Because we want to toll the statute of limitations on the second deed, not the one that issued out of the constable on this execution sale."
1987.86-1430,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.32,533.945,Trespass to try title.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,536.722,548.687,"--If we do not win here, we automatically lose that case because in trespass to try title, you must prove... you have a burden placed upon you to prove your ownership good as against the entitled world."
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.303,592.578,"But, Mr. Schimmel, if your real problem, if your real complaint is the inability to make a collateral attack, which is what you're now discussing, surely the way to remedy that is to appeal from the decision that does not allow you to make a collateral attack, rather than to say that this rule, Rule 19, is bad."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,608.633,618.676,"Mr. Justice, when I sat down with this case the first time and researched the law on it, the courts of the State of Texas told me it was mandated for me to bring a bill of review proceeding."
1987.86-1430,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.748,638.824,"If that happens, come and appeal the collateral attack."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,641.292,650.992,"It's my understanding that if the theories in Pinnoyer v. Neff and Coe v. Armstrong are still good law today, that we should be able to directly attack this."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,684.213,687.711,Exactly what section of the Constitution do you rely on?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,687.711,691.084,"The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,691.084,692.991,Would you explain how you get under that?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,692.991,705.079,"Well, the law of the State of Texas says that force and effect can be given where personal jurisdiction has not been had over us."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,710.031,711.188,Was that point raised?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,711.188,712.905,"Yes, sir, it was raised."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.905,714.654,Was it raised here?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,714.654,716.544,"Yes, sir, it was raised here."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,717.34,719.746,I thought all you were raising here is the rule was wrong.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,719.746,721.184,--Sir?
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.184,722.822,The Texas rule is wrong.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,725.945,727.649,Case law is part of the rule.
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,729.804,732.834,Am I correct that you all you are objecting to is the rule?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,732.834,737.285,--The rule and the cases that go with it has been objected to.
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,744.423,746.578,You think so.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,746.578,748.515,"Well, not only that,--"
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,748.515,751.389,"And, then, in order to rule with you, we have to think that way."
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,751.389,753.279,"--I hope you agree with me, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,753.279,754.107,You do?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,754.107,754.747,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,754.747,759.964,I just don't see any federal question in the case.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,761.682,769.897,"Sir, there is a federal question whenever eighty acres is taken away on a void default judgment without personal service of process over the defendant."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.482,795.997,Are you trying to use this case to decide that other one?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,795.997,796.683,"Which other one, sir?"
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.683,798.198,The one you have pending right now.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,798.198,804.071,"This case, if we do not win this case, will automatically decide the other one against us."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,804.071,806.867,Do you agree that we can't decide that case now?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,806.867,809.459,"Oh, I certainly agree that you cannot decide that case now."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.459,810.506,"Then, why do you keep arguing that?"
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,810.506,812.114,Sir?
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,812.114,814.364,Why do you keep arguing it?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,816.175,817.284,"I'm sorry, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,818.83,821.689,Just then you brought it up.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,826.108,829.263,"Oh, no, sir, I do not need to win in that case in order to win this case, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,832.402,835.745,But what do you need... you need to show how the state denied you due process.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,835.745,836.589,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.589,840.291,And the only thing you say is the rule is a bad rule.
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,840.291,849.147,The rule requires us to show meritorious defense to overturn a judgment which was entered without due process of law.
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.72,865.517,Were you in the Armstrong case?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,865.517,866.329,--Sir?
1987.86-1430,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,866.329,868.14,Were you in the Armstrong case?
1987.86-1430,0,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,868.14,869.062,"No, sir, I was not."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1307.515,1313.498,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.986,1343.423,"Mr. Urquhart, could I interrupt you?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1343.423,1344.328,--Yes.
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.328,1349.076,The State of Texas has filed an amicus curiae brief.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1349.076,1349.576,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.576,1360.338,"In which they say that once the time for all of the prior proceedings, which they describe, have elapsed, the only remaining way to directly attack the voidable default judgment is through a bill of review."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1363.337,1373.162,"I agree with the statement, underlining that the only way to directly attack a void judgment is through the bill of review mechanism."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.162,1382.299,"But, then, they go on and describe injunctive relief, but they say that in the other reliefs, you also must plead a meritorious defense."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1382.299,1391.201,"Your Honor, what the Attorney General's brief was doing was reciting methods of direct attack."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.611,1428.328,"Yes, but the consequence of bringing it is that if you make such an allegation and have an arguable defense, they set aside the judgment, don't they?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1428.328,1431.342,"Only to immediately reinstate it, Your Honor."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.342,1433.327,Only to immediately reinstate it?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1433.327,1434.233,Right.
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.375,1472.311,Why is it a waste of time?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1481.402,1481.808,No.
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.596,1509.344,I understand.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1509.344,1512.951,And a court had jurisdiction.
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.951,1524.697,"But if you did have a good... say you set aside the judgment, said okay we'll now try the case, you try the case, you enter a new judgment, that would mean that the earlier execution on the void judgment would no longer stand."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1524.697,1527.977,"But the bill of review procedure, Your Honor, works like this."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.288,1533.226,"Yes, but you have to enter a new judgment, wouldn't you?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1539.379,1540.489,"--Right, and this--"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.489,1546.047,"And, therefore, would that not vacate the prior proceedings taken in execution of the original judgment?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1546.047,1547.703,"--It would, in fact, Your Honor."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.703,1552.748,"And would you... do you concede that if his allegations are true, that this is a void judgment?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1552.748,1556.419,"I think I'd go further than that, Your Honor."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.261,1568.15,"Well, then, what's your objection to opening the judgment?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1568.15,1581.364,"Your Honor, my objection is simply this, that what is being attacked in this case is a specific procedure, and the specific procedure is a salutary procedure."
1987.86-1430,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.089,1612.196,"Well, Mr. Urquhart, your opposing counsel vehemently disputes that there is any other procedure which would give him relief."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1617.474,1619.912,"Justice O'Connor, I think that is accurate."
1987.86-1430,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.721,1634.673,Such as what?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1634.673,1635.735,Declaratory judgment.
1987.86-1430,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.531,1644.043,He said that's absolutely unavailable where the judgment on its face recites service was proper.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1644.043,1644.559,--All right.
1987.86-1430,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1704.458,1716.031,"So, in other words, it's an open question whether if this Petitioner follows some other procedure in Texas, whether relief can be obtained?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1716.031,1720.875,"Certainly, Justice O'Connor, and I would think that the Texas courts should be given the opportunity."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1765.123,1769.76,"But, Mr. Urquhart, the Texas court in its opinion didn't make reference to any other remedy."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1783.894,1786.129,I defend the opinion.
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.129,1787.627,You do defend the opinion?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1787.627,1788.049,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.471,1797.748,"Supposing it also said there is no other relief except the bill of review and you may not have any relief unless you can assert a meritorious defense, would you say that would be constitutional?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1797.748,1805.496,"No, sir, and I don't believe that the Justice Evans would have said that either when he wrote the opinion."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.496,1812.274,"But if he's really saying your... the response to the constitutional argument is you pursued the wrong remedy, he didn't say that."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1812.274,1814.352,Nor do I think he had--
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.352,1820.13,Neither does the Texas Attorney General identify any other remedy in which you do not have to prove a meritorious defense.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1821.098,1821.958,"--No, sir."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.02,1826.627,Where does the Texas Attorney General call our attention to the remedy you described?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1826.627,1832.812,"In his first argument, where he says that there is a collateral attack that is available."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.691,1918.171,"But is it not true that while the collateral attack is pending, it takes time, I take it, to litigate the collateral attack, the judgment remains on the books and remains an impediment and a cloud on the title to the assets of this litigant?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1918.171,1919.39,"Under Texas law,--"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.39,1921.34,And what is the justification for that burden?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1921.34,1925.699,"--All right, not to be splitting hairs, Your Honor, but a void judgment is that."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.822,1941.989,"But if it's nothing, it was the foundation for your execution and apparently a sheriff's sale and a lot of other things that happened that caused the transfer of ownership interest in property, all based on this judgment, if we take the facts as pleaded."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1941.989,1953.453,"Well, Justice Stevens, if I could make a comment, none of this execution aspect of the case was in the record."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.577,1962.855,"But can not we presume that if there's a judgment on the books, that they would go ahead and execute it?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1968.683,1972.603,"--Your Honor, if there was a judgment on the books, it could have been--"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.603,1979.523,"And if they didn't know about it, so they couldn't bring a collateral attack until after the sale took place, how could they protect themselves?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,1979.523,1993.782,"--Well, the point is, Your Honor, immediately upon receipt of any notification that any attempt was made to execute on the judgment, they could have done a wide variety of things, which, to this point, they still have not done."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.273,2021.148,"Well, that may be."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2036.235,2040.342,"But, Your Honor, isn't the... assuming--"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.342,2048.495,And I don't understand the state's interest in having that scenario be a possible way to dispose of this kind of litigation.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2048.495,2052.759,"--Well, I'm apparently not explaining myself well, Your Honor."
1987.86-1430,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.17,2134.384,"Mr. Urquhart, as I understand your theory, it's that there's no deprivation of property by the mere existence on the books of this judgment which is void, right?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2134.384,2135.15,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.15,2148.941,"If that is so, how is it that we will entertain an appeal to this Court on the basis of the due process clause from the entry by a state supreme court of a judgment in a matter in which it has no jurisdiction?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2171.012,2203.702,"Justice Scalia, my response to that is, and I start to understand, sir, from the premise that if, as we must accept, the judgment that we're dealing with is a void judgment, all right, then that particular type of judgment, one that is void as a matter of the law of our jurisdiction, all right, cannot be a taking under the due process clause."
1987.86-1430,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.702,2207.81,You may be right.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2253.73,2288.95,"Your Honor, while that, in the abstract and in the important abstract, may be true, my belief is that what we are dealing with in this Court and the only thing that the record in this Court enables the United States Supreme Court to deal with is the constitutionality of a very specific procedure, which is designed for a very specific purpose, not this purpose."
1987.86-1430,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2334.307,2358.203,"Then, Mr. Urquhart, certainly, it seems, I guess, apparent to some my colleagues and perhaps to the counsel that if this were the only provision of Texas law under which one could attack a default judgment entered against him, it might well lack something in the way of procedural due process."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2370.418,2385.129,"It's my position, Your Honor, (1) that he could, (2) that in all honesty that issue is not before this Court and is not briefed and I really cannot presume to speak for the State of Texas."
1987.86-1430,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.129,2399.53,I think it's briefed in a sense that Peralta's contention is that I brought a bill of review because I claimed the judgment was improperly served on my client... on me.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2420.959,2424.004,"Your Honor,--"
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.004,2433.563,I don't know how you escape your concession that if there were no other way to attack that this provision would be unconstitutional.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2445.871,2447.621,"--Your Honor,--"
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.621,2449.448,I thought you agreed to that.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2449.448,2460.194,"--I don't think I did that because, first of all, I have not really agreed that this is a way to attack a void judgment when you have no defense."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.717,2482.794,That's not what you say in your brief.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2512.611,2513.204,All right.
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.075,2527.885,You didn't say that in your brief.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2527.885,2529.947,"That's true, Your Honor, but I think that--"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.947,2533.336,The Texas Court of Appeals didn't say that either.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2533.336,2537.226,"--I think, though, that at least from my point of argument, that is a distinction without a difference."
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.766,2570.681,"Well, would you say that supposing the judgment was entered, the defendant didn't even know about it, and the plaintiff just let it sit there for, say, three years, they just... and then three years later they found out about it and brought a proceeding to set it aside, would you say there had been no impact on... no deprivation of property during that three year period?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2570.681,2576.616,"None caused by the inadequacies of the remedy, particularly the inadequacies--"
1987.86-1430,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.616,2577.943,"Well, I'm not saying whether it's without due process."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2588.017,2589.392,"--Not a void judgment, Your Honor."
1987.86-1430,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.001,2595.531,Although it's appealable here on the basis that there has been a deprivation of property?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2595.531,2599.56,"Your Honor, I will accept the Court's statement on that."
1987.86-1430,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.336,2626.533,"I started off agreeing with you on that, but I just can't explain why we entertain these suits then, unless we are of the view that the mere entry of a void judgment is a deprivation of property."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2658.474,2661.379,"Not in this case, Your Honor, because the judgment by--"
1987.86-1430,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2661.379,2662.846,Forget this case.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2681.902,2687.962,"--My answer to that, Your Honor, is no, because a void judgment does not constitute a taking of property."
1987.86-1430,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2687.962,2710.265,"But, then, you're saying, in effect, that this judgment, which recites on its face that it was properly served and is presumably on file and, you know, a title company looking at that judgment isn't going to go back and interview the people about whether the facts conform to what the record shows, it seems to me that would really be a cloud on the title."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2710.265,2722.682,"But, Your Honor, isn't this really a Paul v. Davis situation, where the most that can be said of a void judgment is that it has an effect on the reputation alone?"
1987.86-1430,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.15,2739.081,"If you believe Shakespeare that he who steals my purse steals trash, perhaps reputation is more important than money, but I should think this would be a real impairment of one's property right."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2748.203,2766.413,"Your Honor, a couple of responses to that is that the liberty issue, which I think the... at least in my respect, the Court is addressing here, we have asserted in our brief was not properly raised below."
1987.86-1430,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.413,2768.944,"That may be right, but how about the property?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2768.944,2797.433,"Your Honor, a void judgment, and here I know that I'm being obnoxiously repetitive, but a void judgment that has no legal effect under Texas law cannot constitute a taking of property except for a pure reputational interest, which, as I understand the Paul v. Davis case, states is not a taking of liberty so as to invoke the due process."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.433,2799.667,But how does anybody know it's void?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2799.667,2800.948,"Well,--"
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.948,2803.102,If you look at the face of the judgment.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2803.102,2813.785,"--Your Honor, since my brief has been properly thrown at me, on page 6 of my opponent's brief, they say that this judgment is... pardon me."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.112,2826.359,"Void on its face, but you have to accept the allegation that he was never served."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2826.359,2828.498,--Which I think--
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.498,2841.385,"I know, but you certainly have to go outside the judgment that's on record to find out whether there was... whether it's void or not, whether there was service or not."
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2841.385,2842.866,--But you can't do anything with it.
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.001,2860.251,"Well, that may be so, but was this property sold?"
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2860.251,2863.529,"Not... Your Honor, the property was sold."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.529,2864.466,Was it foreclosed on?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2864.466,2867.028,"To clear title, it was, yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.028,2867.512,And was--
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2867.512,2869.87,It was foreclosed on by someone else first.
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.87,2870.073,--All right.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2870.995,2873.917,The deed record was transferred.
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.917,2875.821,What about the lawyer who represented the buyer?
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2889.238,2896.517,"I hope I would have done something before we reached this point, Your Honor, in to looking into whether the judgment was valid or not."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.155,2903.529,I suppose he must have charged the client something for getting the judgment--
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2903.529,2906.387,"--I wasn't representing him then, Your Honor."
1987.86-1430,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.387,2913.869,--Whoever represented... got that judgment didn't think he was doing something for nothing or that the judgment was utterly useless.
1987.86-1430,1,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,2913.869,2922.147,"That is certainly true, Your Honor, and we still contend the judgment is not useless, but for the purpose of this argument, we are assuming that it's void."
1987.86-1430,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2996.478,2998.852,"Thank you, Mr. Urquhart."
1987.86-1430,2,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3000.946,3001.663,"Thank you, sir."
1987.86-1430,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.037,3130.766,"Well, do you think it's unconstitutional for a state to say that a paper claim duly recorded after a period of time is taken at its face value?"
1987.86-1430,2,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3130.766,3132.016,"Yes, sir, I do."
1987.86-1430,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.058,3153.163,But maybe you don't have to make quite that sweeping a claim to win this case here.
1987.86-1430,2,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3153.163,3155.241,"Well, fortunately, we didn't wait four years."
1987.86-1430,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.351,3199.754,"What if there had been notice in this case and you had come in and said I have absolutely no defense to this, I haven't paid and--"
1987.86-1430,2,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3199.754,3201.301,"That's due process of law, sir."
1987.86-1430,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.566,3204.644,--Will you just wait a minute until I ask my question?
1987.86-1430,2,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3204.644,3206.565,--Sorry.
1987.86-1430,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.565,3221.42,"What would you have done if you were sued, as you were in this case, and you come in and say I have no defense, I suppose the same judgment would have been entered, and then what would you have done?"
1987.86-1430,2,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3221.42,3223.966,We would have paid the judgment and not lost our property.
1987.86-1430,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.897,3244.955,"That's really what makes this meritorious defense business unconstitutional in your view, I guess."
1987.86-1430,3,33325,jack_e_urquhart,,3244.955,3246.69,"Among other things, yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.107,3300.965,"Mr. Schimmel, can I ask you a question of Texas procedure?"
1987.86-1430,4,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3300.965,3301.152,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1430,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3301.152,3309.822,"Does Texas have a certification procedure whereby if we were concerned about the question of state law, we could certify the question to the Texas court?"
1987.86-1430,4,18064,bruce_ian_schimmel,,3310.571,3314.116,"I am not familiar with that, sir."
1987.86-1430,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3475.054,3478.084,"Thank you, Mr. Schimmel."
