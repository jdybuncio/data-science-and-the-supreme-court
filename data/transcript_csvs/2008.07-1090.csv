2008.07-1090,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1090, Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, and the consolidated case."
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,8.404,26.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Acting with express statutory authority and in furtherance of important foreign policies following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President made inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of law that had applied to countries that sponsored terrorism."
2008.07-1090,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.551,63.756,"Mr. Franklin, even if you are right about that, the legislation was an emergency measure with a sunset."
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,89.641,90.808,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1090,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,249.628,261.37,"Well, what do you make of the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was never its intention, it was never its intention for the President to have the authority to -- to do this?"
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,261.37,268.791,"Two things, Justice Alito: The -- the first point is that this was not the Congress that acted in 2003."
2008.07-1090,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.665,338.351,Including -- including the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7).
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,340.637,354.461,"--Well, we don't agree with that, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the waiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive application of extant provisions of law to the extent they might affect Iraq."
2008.07-1090,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.917,417.154,"Because technically it's just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment."
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,423.707,427.826,"Well, we are talking here about a waiver applied to a repeal."
2008.07-1090,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,466.068,466.82,I agree.
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,466.82,467.403,--Okay.
2008.07-1090,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.403,484.013,Do we have any other instance in which a jurisdictional provision is withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,484.013,492.369,"Well, I think the closest analogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the precise circumstances we have here, and that is the doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity."
2008.07-1090,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,648.388,662.48,"Were there judgments, outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on appeal?"
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,662.48,666.282,"There is at least two that I am aware of, two default judgments."
2008.07-1090,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.599,696.634,And you're not claiming that those could be reopened?
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,696.634,699.836,We are not claiming in this -- in this proceeding they could be reopened.
2008.07-1090,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,769.849,774.151,I take it your argument would be no different if this involved some other area.
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,778.538,792.846,"No, it doesn't depend on it, but I do think it's important to recognize that the President was acting in that -- in that field when he made these determinations, and to also recognize that these determinations -- the foreign policy of the United States has not changed."
2008.07-1090,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.711,833.673,"I also gather that the ability of the President or the United States to seek some compensation from Iraq through diplomatic channels on behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by this outcome, right?"
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,833.673,834.708,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2008.07-1090,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,868.596,870.798,"--That is before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?"
2008.07-1090,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,870.798,879.285,"That is true, but this case involve the doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity and it embodies the same concerns of reciprocity that were at issue then."
2008.07-1090,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,882.32,883.439,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,897.865,913.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision of law that applies to countries that have sponsored terrorism."
2008.07-1090,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.365,994.41,"I thought we were just told that because there -- of the limitations on enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them."
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,994.41,1000.766,That is because of the authorities that the President exercised under the second proviso of 1503.
2008.07-1090,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1118.308,1142.023,"Is -- is all of this -- I won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying, well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's no cause of action."
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1142.023,1143.458,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1090,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1192.156,1195.324,Where the wrong occurred would have been Iraq.
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1195.324,1196.86,--That's right.
2008.07-1090,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1290.388,1302.862,Wouldn't any such settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and probably the worst victims of the terror?
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1302.862,1307.081,"Well, Your Honor, I think that -- that that is one consideration."
2008.07-1090,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1347.674,1352.726,"Well, you don't doubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim that could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act?"
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1352.726,1352.892,--No.
2008.07-1090,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1363.582,1364.95,And that claim could--
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1364.95,1365.4,--the abrogation of immunity.
2008.07-1090,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1365.4,1371.788,"--Putting aside the waiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that there has been a change in the governing authority in Iraq?"
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1371.788,1372.688,That's right.
2008.07-1090,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.19,1436.13,You said that there should be deference to what the executive did because of his role in foreign affairs.
2008.07-1090,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1451.073,1452.506,That is true.
2008.07-1090,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1501.738,1503.274,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1506.14,1520.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court will want to have available to it the blue brief for the Petitioners and Joint Appendix Volume 2, which together reproduce the statutes that are relevant to this case."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1611.544,1614.912,Why would -- why would Congress have wanted to make that distinction?
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1614.912,1619.065,"--Let's -- let me take you to the reason, and that is in Joint Appendix Volume 2."
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.589,1656.189,It's a long section.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1657.191,1658.658,--I am going to take you straight to the text.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1666.88,1667.363,Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1667.963,1668.446,--Sorry.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.265,1671.867,Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1671.867,1673.467,"Okay, this is how you get designated:"
2008.07-1090,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.137,1781.421,"Well, there may have not been a new one, but there certainly was not the old one either."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1781.421,1782.238,Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.883,1802.352,"But there's nothing better settled -- well, perhaps that's broad."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1810.691,1811.525,That's correct.
2008.07-1090,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1811.525,1813.108,That's all that was happening here.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1818.012,1818.895,Exactly right--
2008.07-1090,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1818.895,1825.717,And that is under -- and under the law something that has always been committed to the very large discretion of the President.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1825.717,1827.45,"--I couldn't agree with you more, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1852.585,1856.97,But it was -- the text of it was not limited to rescinding that designation.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1858.939,1859.422,--Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.002,1958.971,But this statute specifically short-circuits that process.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1975.999,1980.218,"--Yes, the de-designation becomes effective immediately."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2009.404,2009.57,All right.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2010.57,2011.089,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2011.089,2021.195,--for the sake of argument that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and against the point you've just made are evenly balanced.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2069.192,2078.798,"I would say, no, because that regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes, has been profoundly changed by the enactment of the FSIA."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2079.966,2083.368,"Well, it's been profoundly changed if we accept your argument."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2101.314,2101.647,--Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2130.583,2135.987,"Yes, but the President, quite apart from the immunity designation, the President had the authority to compromise suits."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2135.987,2142.141,"--Well, fine, and if that is espousal power continues to exist, then the President can attempt to exercise it."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2142.141,2148.81,"I don't know whether it continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument, and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of this argument."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2166.422,2166.756,Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2179.349,2184.401,"Well, he hasn't set it up because he thinks he has got the authority under this statute or had the authority under this statute."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2184.401,2186.002,"--Justice Souter, it wouldn't work like that."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.572,2194.858,"Oh, I -- I quite agree with that."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2194.858,2195.374,So can I--
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.374,2200.643,--So I suppose the first step in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on now.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2200.643,2209.348,"--Well, the President purported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six years ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I think he would have."
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.117,2218.823,"But why -- why shouldn't we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act said Congress is setting the rules."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2242.755,2243.255,--Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2312.349,2317.82,"But as a practical matter, isn't this closely associated with appropriations and with foreign aid?"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2345.822,2351.476,"Because this -- well, because what Congress was doing was confronting an emergency."
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.543,2385.047,--Why -- why does it say then any other provision of law?
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2391.351,2391.868,Well--
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2391.868,2393.153,"And I mean, just to add to that--"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2393.153,2393.553,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2393.553,2398.605,--It said under 620A of Foreign Assistance or any other provision of law.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2407.194,2412.198,"Oh, Justice Souter, I don't think that that -- let me, if I could take the two points in turn."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2440.515,2440.784,Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2448.704,2457.043,"--I actually do disagree and believe you can logically look at the statute -- in the sense that the word ""any"" means ""every"", that is true."
2008.07-1090,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.434,2468.884,"Mr. Goldstein, could I ask this question?"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2487.913,2495.184,"I am saying that except for those that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the kind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal with correctly."
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.357,2508.409,Can you -- I would like to follow up on Justice Stevens's question.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2531.508,2535.144,"If it's anything, it would be the export of military hardware."
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.159,2556.575,"Wait, wait."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2558.042,2558.659,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.659,2559.611,--and we have a new government--
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2559.611,2560.261,We don't have a new government.
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.261,2561.194,Oh--
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.194,2562.896,"--Yo mean some period of days, or something?"
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.896,2563.513,--Who's paying for these shipments?
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2577.155,2579.874,"Well, it's not -- it's not entirely clear there is still a government in Iraq."
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.874,2581.474,"All right, is there any one other than that?"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2581.474,2581.84,No.
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.84,2582.24,No.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2582.642,2583.009,I think -- I think--
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.009,2584.792,"So basically, basically your reading--"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2584.792,2585.292,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.292,2588.194,"--is the word ""any other"" does apply to any other."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2588.194,2588.713,Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2588.713,2589.53,Except your case.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2589.53,2589.963,Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.963,2591.748,And possibly this thing for a couple of days.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2591.748,2592.298,Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.298,2598.169,"Well, that isn't exactly an absurd result then, to say ""any other"" really means any other including this case."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2598.169,2604.14,"Well, Justice Breyer, in -- the same point was made in cases like Atascadero and Raygor."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.111,2717.896,Why did -- why did he need the statute to do that?
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2724.419,2725.935,"That's exactly right, but that's the point."
2008.07-1090,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.921,2758.89,But that's -- that's just a belt-and-suspenders act.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2771.281,2773.666,"--I -- I disagree, but we will accept that."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2792.229,2801.602,"And it may also be an indication that he thought he had effectively accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2801.602,2809.006,"I -- I don't understand, Justice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new government is recognized, suddenly decide to de-designate Iraq."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2810.108,2811.475,"I -- I don't know, either."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2836.425,2839.877,"--Well, it -- I agree it would be consistent with the assumption that he had the authority here."
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2854.137,2862.909,"But, Mr. Goldstein, before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what you think about the claim for relief."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2881.621,2883.337,--The Solicitor General has it right.
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2890.977,2891.943,Which -- which State law?
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2891.943,2895.012,The State law generally of the home State of the plaintiffs.
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2895.012,2916.21,"So that -- by that reasoning, people all over the world could sue the United States in their courts alleging that the United States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with respect to their nationals."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2939.291,2951.717,"Well, that is clear -- well, in -- in terms of whether or not a foreign country would look to our law and say, well, we're just doing the same thing as you do, that would arise from -- also from new section 1605A."
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.717,2952.15,No.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2952.817,2954.15,"Yes, I understand, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.433,2977.899,"Well, no."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3002.65,3007.804,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the source of the underlying cause of action is not presented by this case."
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.22,3010.756,"I know, but we have been talking about it--"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3010.756,3011.089,Sure--
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.089,3011.755,"--for a couple of minutes, so we--"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3011.755,3012.089,--Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.624,3016.993,--I didn't start this.
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3018.826,3020.028,"I did, and you can--"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3020.028,3020.511,--All right.
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3020.511,3022.295,--You can go back to your jurisdiction argument.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3022.295,3022.761,Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3061.938,3062.372,If I could just pause--
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3062.372,3063.222,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.222,3063.722,--for a moment.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3074.662,3076.531,I don't think the question is presented here.
2008.07-1090,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.749,3086.987,"Well, it's not presented because your friends on the other side think the -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3094.243,3103.782,"I agree he has that argument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case -- in his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the cert petition, I should say, in the question on this Court -- on which this Court granted certiorari."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3152.33,3153.798,"Why -- why do you say ""permanently""?"
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3153.798,3154.431,--Because--
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3154.431,3160.268,"Just under -- just under this statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind the action that made it inapplicable."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3160.268,3162.053,"--I don't understand how, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3167.339,3176.647,"Well -- no, but during the period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know of any reason why he cannot change his designation of inapplicability."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3189.205,3191.823,"--That's fine while it was in effect, but it's not anymore."
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.234,3239.803,I think -- I think what they say is that the designation remains in effect.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3245.224,3246.974,I don't understand--
2008.07-1090,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3246.974,3249.093,"I'd be -- well, I'll ask them, but I'd be surprised if it's--"
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3249.093,3254.58,"Let me -- let me ask the same question with respect to the new statute, the ""capital A"" statute."
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3254.58,3254.997,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3254.997,3256.849,Would there be -- and I just -- I don't know the answer to this.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3260.051,3260.834,No.
2008.07-1090,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3266.038,3266.338,Okay.
2008.07-1090,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3279.278,3286.034,--I have no -- I'm not aware of any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given the President any such power.
2008.07-1090,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3309.567,3312.417,Congress could pass a law.
2008.07-1090,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3314.169,3315.971,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1090,3,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3318.673,3320.073,"Thank you, Your Honor--"
2008.07-1090,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.073,3322.208,You want to clarify this last part--
2008.07-1090,3,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3322.208,3322.791,--Yes.
2008.07-1090,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.791,3324.108,--we have just been discussing?
2008.07-1090,3,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3324.108,3331.896,It is not the position of the Government of Iraq that in the very hypothetical instance in which something would change that they could not be redesignated.
2008.07-1090,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.552,3343.121,I thought you'd say that.
2008.07-1090,3,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3343.121,3352.144,"--It is our position that it will be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now a very strong ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism, not a sponsor of it."
2008.07-1090,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3518.901,3519.568,"Thank you, counsel."
