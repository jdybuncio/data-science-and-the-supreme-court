1985.85-499,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.274,We will hear arguments next in Papasan against Mississippi.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,5.856,25.678,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there is a line drawn across the State of Mississippi, an arbitrary line that divides the school children of that state into two classes."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,67.195,84.967,"Could I ask you right now, do you claim that it is contrary to federal law or the Constitution for the state to allow this school land money to be allocated to the counties in which the land is?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,91.53,96.655,"I think it is contrary to federal law, Justice White, for them to do as they are doing."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.955,99.838,"Well, that doesn't answer my question."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,99.838,104.659,"--I think it is contrary... yes, to answer your question in a word."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,104.659,105.24,Good.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,115.887,119.799,"I think that they could do that as part of the relief that we seek, yes."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.799,137.892,"I know, but I thought you said that it would be contrary to federal law to let the counties in which the land is located have all the money generated for that land."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,137.892,139.592,Not precisely.
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.181,181.36,"Well, suppose there wasn't this Cherokee land involved at all, and every county in the state had that section of land or whatever it was, those sections of land, but that those lands in the different counties produced different income, different levels of income, and some counties from the school land would be getting X dollars per child, and other counties would be getting one-tenth that per child."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,183.93,185.713,"Well, in the first place--"
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.713,187.003,"Would it be, or not?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,187.003,193.518,"--Yes, yes, indeed, it would be, and that is the situation that does in fact exist in lots of state, where the state has not done--"
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.518,199.522,So you do not attack allocating the income to the counties in which the land is located.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,199.522,213.44,"--As a matter of fact, the language of the trust says that that is what is to be... in other words, the land is to be maintained for the benefit of the township in which the land is located, but we have gone beyond that in Mississippi."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.44,214.471,I understand.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,214.471,215.523,That is my point.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,215.523,218.245,"Mr. Freeland, I am not sure I understand the facts."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,238.387,240.558,"No, Justice Powell, that is--"
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,240.558,241.86,That is incorrect?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,241.86,242.972,--That is incorrect.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,242.972,243.292,All right.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,244.364,244.694,All right.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,281.325,283.679,"The United States Government did that, didn't it?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,283.679,304.641,"That is correct, and of course the United States government realized what it had done, subsequently passed a statute that said, we are going to give the state 177,555 acres of new lands to replace these lands that we wrongfully, if you will, sold to the Indians."
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,391.129,395.18,Did they put all of that money in the railroads?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,395.18,410.02,"No, as a matter of fact, if you read the statute, I believe they put about $400,000 of it into the railroads, railroads, incidentally, that had no rolling stock, had not been built, and to add insult to injury, they were in south Mississippi, not in north Mississippi where our 23 counties are."
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,410.02,415.656,And no suit has been brought against the state in all the years that have passed since then?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,415.656,417.647,Until this day.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.647,439.65,"Mr. Freeland, I assume as far as you are concerned that we could take judicial notice of the matters in the public record such as the annual report of the superintendent of public education to the state legislature from Mississippi."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,439.65,441.923,"Certainly, Justice O'Connor."
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.804,461.925,"And in looking at that report, it appears that there are other state funds that go toward the pupil costs of public education in the State of Mississippi other than the 16th Section and lieu lands revenue."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,461.925,469.328,Is the Court referring to general appropriations or are we talking about--
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.328,475.132,Appropriations that go to the costs of public school education.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,475.132,477.175,--Aside from the school lands trust.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.175,482.188,"Yes, aside from the 16th Section and the lieu lands revenues."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,482.188,483.54,That is precisely correct.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.54,501.43,"What percentage of the funds per pupil would you say comes from other funds, local, state, and possibly federal, other than these moneys you are worried about, the lieu lands and 16th Section?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,501.43,502.72,May I illustrate in dollars?
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,521.664,527.618,"Well, my question goes to what other revenues go toward public school education."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,531.88,543.467,The fund represents outside the Chickasaw Cession approximately 20 percent of the total school funds available to the schools in the State of Mississippi.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,560.781,562.461,"State, local, and federal?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,562.461,564.56,I believe that's correct.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.56,566.343,"All money, state, local, and federal."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,566.343,567.582,I believe that's correct.
1985.85-499,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,569.805,572.709,I share Justice O'Connor's concern.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,584.655,590.719,"Justice Blackmun, that is precisely our complaint."
1985.85-499,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,592.291,597.354,"I get the other impression from looking at the facts here, but go ahead and explain."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,597.354,598.575,"No, they certainly do not."
1985.85-499,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,613.466,619.48,"I know, you say that, but we are asking, overall, with all other funds available, what is the answer?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,619.48,620.919,The answer is the same.
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.831,626.032,But what order of magnitude are we talking about?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,640.042,642.103,Outside the Chickasaw Cession.
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.724,647.737,"And how much comes in... much more than 80 percent, perhaps approaching 100 percent?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,647.737,648.578,"No, no, no."
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.402,669.242,"Counsel, what we are interested in is, what is the disparity, when you add all the figures together of all sources for public education?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,678.357,689.665,"It is... if I have got my mathematics correct, Justice Rehnquist, it is... yes, roughly, I would say that would be correct."
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.665,700.292,And is it your position that the 80 percent funding does not give a minimally adequate education?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,700.292,713.54,"It is our position that the lack of a minimally adequate education, and as the Court understands, we are here on a 12(b)(6) motion, is the effect of the denial of the rights that we claim under this trust, and not the cause."
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.073,730.46,And you say that the absence of the cession lands revenues makes the difference between a minimally adequate education and not?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,730.46,731.572,That is correct.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,731.572,735.916,"Mr. Freeland, I would like to go back to the fundamentals."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,745.06,748.593,"I would say not, the state."
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,748.593,749.615,The state has.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,749.615,750.095,Yes.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,750.095,755.949,Is the funding of public education the largest single item in the state budget?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,755.949,757.87,"That, I believe, is true."
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,757.87,760.721,I think that is true in most states.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,768.568,771.758,Average daily attendance I believe is the basis.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,771.758,772.629,Average daily attendance.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,777.722,778.823,We have no complaint about that.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,778.823,779.624,None whatever.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,779.624,780.295,None whatever.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,781.777,788.132,"What percentage, again I ask you, of the funds in these counties comes from that state appropriation?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,789.512,793.906,"I am not positive of that figure, but I would say it would be approximately correct."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.906,800.05,You said it was 80 percent in the south.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,800.05,802.37,"In the south, and it would be higher than that--"
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.37,809.506,"And it would be, I thought you said, about 97 percent, that only 3 percent of the money came from the lieu lands."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,809.506,813.227,--The 3 percent was trying to compare what we get from the lieu lands.
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.52,825.355,"So again, how much, what percentage in the north part of the state is comparable to the 80 percent in the south?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,826.827,829.078,The percent that we actually get from the state?
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.078,830.009,Yes.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,830.009,832.871,The funding is basically the same.
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.311,836.512,The percentage.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,836.512,841.666,"--Well, let me say this first."
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.38,883.983,"Insofar as you claim a violation of the trust, that really occurred over 100 years ago, didn't it?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,883.983,885.875,Not the violation that we are suing on.
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.995,908.489,"Well, but that is, you know, that is the way everybody tries to get around the statute of limitations, is to say, well, this didn't just happen in 1868."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,913.104,931.605,"This Court has said that where there is a trust and the trustee converts the corpus of the trust, and thereafter continues to admit, as the State of Mississippi has done in this situation, that the duty is owed to continue paying income, that the statute of limitations doesn't run."
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.51,946.464,"The trustee doesn't admit of any greater duty, obviously, than to pay the income from the substitute funds."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,946.464,948.056,--That is another point.
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.297,971.341,So the legislature simply appropriates what would have... a hypothetical income on that fund?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,971.341,990.314,"For years they appropriated first 8 percent, starting with '56, then they dropped it to 7, and then in the constitution of 1890 they dropped it to 6 percent, which amounted to something over $60,000 per annum to be divided amongst 23 counties, and then in 1984 they came back again and said, we know we have violated this trust."
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.147,1000.692,"The only reason that the northern counties are treated any differently than the southern was the bad investment during the Civil War... pardon me, the War Between the States, wasn't it?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1000.692,1010.279,The state of Mississippi would like to... I hope this is the last occasion on which any state official from Mississippi uses the Civil War as an excuse for some of their wrongdoing.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.398,1034.993,"Well, aren't you really asking damages for prior breaches of the trust obligation?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1034.993,1036.675,Absolutely not.
1985.85-499,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1037.935,1039.497,There is no corpus left.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1039.497,1053.265,"--That, though, is the fault of the state, the trustee and the state officials who are acting as trustees, and where a trustee does that the law of trust places the trustee under a very specific obligation."
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1084.966,1096.375,"Mr. Freeman, I am sure Mississippi, like other states in the public school system tests the progress of pupils periodically in different grades."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1106.821,1108.364,The record does not.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1123.922,1131.779,"Without such a showing, how can you persuade as that people in your county, children in your county are not receiving a minimally adequate education?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1131.779,1139.153,"--Because, Justice Powell, this case is here on a 12(b)(6) motion, and that is our allegation, and for purposes of this argument--"
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1139.153,1141.176,But you have to allege facts to support it.
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1142.835,1148.669,--The fact that we allege is that this is the result of the denial.
1985.85-499,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1148.669,1157.515,How do you define minimum adequate education?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1157.515,1174.516,"Well, let's say at the minimum it would be something that would raise the pupil above the level of a functional illiterate, and we literally have schools in Mississippi where they are being denied even that, and a lot of them are not... Tunica County,... I keep going back to that."
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.431,1257.192,"Both those cases came up through the state court system, didn't they?"
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1257.192,1260.632,Lassen... Alamo did not.
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.632,1262.185,Alamo came up through the federal courts?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1262.185,1263.244,It came up through the federal courts.
1985.85-499,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1277.626,1281.886,"Well, of course, the Eleventh Amendment is no bar to a suit by the United States against the states."
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1281.886,1297.598,"And we submit, Justice Rehnquist, the Eleventh Amendment is no bar to prospective injunctive relief, which tells these trustees to cease violating the terms of this trust in the future, to do your duty in the future, and that is what we are asking here."
1985.85-499,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.77,1317.223,This is an equal protection case?
1985.85-499,0,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,1317.223,1319.753,"Yes, it certainly is."
1985.85-499,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.679,1590.912,Yes.

1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.71,1675.168,Mr. Arnold--
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1675.168,1675.719,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.719,1688.058,--is the state under an obligation to return the money attributable to 16th Section lands to the school district in which the 16th Section is located?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1688.058,1689.728,"Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1701.485,1703.458,Are they pooled then?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1703.458,1704.548,"--Yes, Your Honor."

1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1707.469,1708.481,--income is pooled?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1708.481,1708.771,No.
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1730.739,1740.032,"My question was, is there some obligation that those moneys from the 16th Section go to the school district in which the section is located?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1740.032,1741.944,"Yes, I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1741.944,1743.096,Is that a state law requirement--
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1743.096,1743.466,"No, ma'am."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.466,1744.488,--or a federal law requirement.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1744.488,1745.978,That is a federal law requirement.
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.381,1785.103,Who does do the leasing?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1786.603,1793.909,"No, sir, it is... the individual board of education in that school district leases the lands and the minerals thereunder, Your Honor."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.909,1802.555,So that it is only those school districts in which lands are located that are going to get any of the money.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1802.555,1806.906,"Yes, sir, and the amount they get depends upon the geographical location of the school district."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.906,1808.258,I understand.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1817.094,1819.656,"Yes, sir, that is a fact."
1985.85-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.852,1853.368,"And a school district that occupied two or three townships, I suppose it would have two or three sources of this kind of income."
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1853.368,1857.319,"Yes, sir, it would if it had the 16th Section lands in it."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.126,1888.25,What do you think governs the obligation to return that money to the school district in which it is located?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1896.906,1904.48,"To return the money in the Chocktaw, where they actually have the land, Your Honor?"

1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1905.402,1907.595,"Well, I think it could have been done another way."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.429,1919.2,And put it in a pool and redistribute it.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1919.2,1922.052,"--Yes, I think it could have done that, but it also had the option to allow--"
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.052,1925.825,"So, has the state made it a state law that it will not do that?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1925.825,1929.357,"--Yes, ma'am, it is in the constitution, Section 211."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1929.357,1931.018,The state constitution.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1931.018,1933.812,"Yes, ma'am, provides for how it is done."
1985.85-499,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.412,1969.973,"Would those values have any impact on the issues raised in this case, do you think?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,1969.973,1973.886,"They seem to think, Your Honor... we think the issues come down very simply in this case."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.367,2053.809,What does the Secretary of State say?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2053.809,2064.475,"Well, he had a lot to say, I believe, Your Honor, that we somewhat oppose, but I don't believe the Secretary of State spoke to the issues in the case here."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.039,2074.072,What is his role?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2082.217,2086.882,--He has a supervisory role as to the 16th Section lands in the Chocktaw Cession.
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.537,2097.427,I understand.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2105.672,2106.403,The Chocktaw?
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.023,2186.947,"Mr. Arnold, do you agree with the statements of Mr. Freeland about the amount of money that goes per pupil for education from all sources other than these 16th Section and lieu lands moneys?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2186.947,2189.99,"Your Honor, I do not agree with some of his statements there."
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.772,2258.185,"Mr. Arnold, could I ask a question right there?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2258.185,2258.556,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.556,2272.835,"As I understand it, the discrepancy with regard to the trust fund income is the difference between 63 cents and $75 per pupil, and as I understand what you are saying now, the additional money supplied by the State of Mississippi are the same per pupil, whether it is $50 or--"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2272.835,2273.156,Yes.
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.156,2284.773,"--So the discrepancy between $75 and 63 cents, although it would be a different percentage, in absolute dollars is the same percentage after you add in the Mississippi supplemental fund."
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2285.234,2288.446,"Based on the figures that are there, Your Honor, those figures--"
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.446,2289.585,Maybe they are a little off.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2289.585,2294.109,--They have changed substantially since 1985.
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.895,2308.419,"Does that $2 million totally eliminate the differential, or does it just reduce it a great deal?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2308.419,2309.02,"No, sir."
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.96,2337.538,"But on that point I also was wondering with regard to Justice Powell's earlier question, as I understand the Court of Appeals opinion, they took the allegations of the complaint at face value and said that your motion to dismiss was properly sustained."
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2343.911,2344.432,--Yes.
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.432,2349.996,"Which does make this allegation about not a minimally adequate education, whatever it is."
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2356.661,2358.541,"That is the position of the state, Your Honor."
1985.85-499,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2358.541,2365.968,"But I am just wondering, we are really limited to the complaint itself for purposes of our decision as to whether it needs further--"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2367.587,2369.69,"Well pled facts, I believe."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.69,2383.188,"And $75 per student, that is just the... is that the highest that any school district gets from the 16th Section lands?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2383.188,2384.127,"--No, sir, I believe that is an average."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.127,2385.169,That is an average.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2385.169,2385.569,Average.
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.569,2390.923,But aren't there some school districts in the Chocktaw area that don't get any?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2390.923,2394.475,"Yes, sir, there are some that get absolute zero, as I pointed out."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.475,2398.819,And which is less than the Chickasaw school districts get.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2398.819,2400.389,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.88,2418.32,From the 16th Section lands?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2418.32,2418.751,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.856,2425.694,I understand.
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2425.694,2428.746,"And a distinction that should be made, I believe--"
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.746,2441.406,"What would be the... is that $75 per student, is that the average per student in the school districts that get something, or does that average out through all of the school districts?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2441.406,2444.568,--I think that is the average for all school districts.
1985.85-499,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.178,2447.56,Including the ones who don't get anything?
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2447.56,2451.884,"--Yes, Your Honor, and of course that is inflated."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2764.75,2794.02,"Mr. Arnold, what... to the extent that the plaintiff said in the complaint Mississippi is depriving the children of the plaintiff class of a minimally adequate education, and that is prohibited by the equal protection clause, now, just to that extent, is that barred in your view also by the Eleventh Amendment, that kind of a claim?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2794.02,2795.991,"Your Honor, I believe it would be."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2808.458,2829.322,"Well, assuming that what the Court said was that you will apply a higher level of scrutiny if a child is denied a minimally adequate public school education, and that is alleged in the complaint, do you think the Eleventh Amendment absolutely bars that complaint in federal court?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2829.322,2839.801,"--If the state is the real true party in interest, Your Honor, to require the state to expend funds, perhaps it would."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2847.385,2850.576,"Well, I guess the facts weren't developed, were they?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2850.576,2861.864,"--Right, but as the facts are alleged here, I believe the Eleventh Amendment would proscribe that, would be a jurisdictional bar as far as the State of Mississippi, and it is the real party in interest in this case, we submit."
1985.85-499,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2872.762,2882.787,"If you are right, why wouldn't the San Antonio case have gone off on the Eleventh Amendment grounds rather than the substantive equal protection decision?"
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2882.787,2883.989,"I am not sure, Your Honor."
1985.85-499,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2930.68,2942.557,"The reason it was difficult to address it, of course, is that the record that we got just didn't really reflect what other funding the state gives to peoples."
1985.85-499,1,38588,richard_lloyd_arnold,,2943.989,2967.704,"Perhaps in the record not, Your Honor, but in our brief, I believe, on Page 6 we referred to the minimum program for education that the State of Mississippi provides and what those funds go to, and how it goes to each school district based upon the teacher units."
1985.85-499,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.614,3082.619,Mr. Freeland.
1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3082.619,3093.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, counsel says that there are school districts in the State of Mississippi that get no 16th Section land money."
1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.378,3114.419,Counties or school districts?

1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.794,3125.196,Are the leases made by the counties?
1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3125.196,3127.728,Under the supervisor of the Secretary of State.
1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.728,3133.412,"I know, but the counties don't make... the lease rental is not paid to the county, is it?"
1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3133.412,3137.374,"No, it is paid to the county school board as it now stands."
1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.374,3140.696,"It is paid to school districts, isn't it?"

1985.85-499,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.528,3146.64,"Well, school districts are not necessarily coterminus with counties, are they?"
1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3150.192,3154.975,"Absolutely, and that is the point also as to Meridian, for example."
1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.389,3274.124,What if we disagree with you that there is any trust at all?
1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3278.606,3279.296,I do indeed.
1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.296,3280.658,Even if there is no trust.
1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3280.658,3281.448,If there is no trust.
1985.85-499,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.289,3293.636,And even if the Chickasaw counties or school districts have no claim whatsoever to any moneys from 16th Section lands or from lieu lands.

1985.85-499,2,42689,t_h_freeland_iii,,3314.79,3318.052,--I am arguing that I have got a two-way street here.
