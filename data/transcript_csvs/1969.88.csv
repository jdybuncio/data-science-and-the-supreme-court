1969.88,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.518,Number 88 United States against Reynolds.
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,25.46,27.878,May it please the Court.
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,827.229,831.024,"Well, isn't the Court decides on these records?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,831.024,840.695,Whether the area in dispute is within the scope of the project in the Reynolds' case.
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.186,1007.63,"I didn't know, you're talking now about what acreage?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1007.63,1017.008,The 140 which is the remainder after the 78 and 172 were taken.
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.008,1020.887,"I see, it's the part not taken at all?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1020.887,1022.157,That's right.
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.76,1024.857,Of this -- of this party's land?
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1024.857,1030.388,"Yeah, the enhancement is added on."
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.421,1122.759,Is this an argument that more evidence wanting the jury on the -- should have gotten to the jury?
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1122.759,1122.896,No.
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1122.896,1124.978,The jury found against enhancement?
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1124.978,1129.99,"No, the court in its comment made certain statements what --"
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.99,1139.537,"Yes, but let's assume that same thing is telling the jury that there is the record something that is not at all, is that right?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1147.712,1158.979,"Yes, the witness testified as to the probability of taking for recreational area and this is the area which the judge should not have state --"
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1158.979,1165.248,"But even though the judge told the jury that, the jury found there was no enhancement, isn't that right?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1165.248,1165.397,That is said --
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1165.397,1170.533,"$20,000.00 verdict was a verdict based on the finding of no enhancement, was it?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1170.533,1175.618,We maintain that this is -- it should not have gone to the jury at all.
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.618,1183.711,"I appreciate that but how will you have heard by going to the jury if the jury came in with a $20,000.00 verdict on the basis of no enhancement?"
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1183.711,1195.398,"Well that's â€“ we are saying that if it's a question for the Court, then the $20,000.00 verdict should be sustained."
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1207.986,1210.12,That's the first branch of your case that you've been arguing right now?
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1210.12,1213.661,"Right now, because --"
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.661,1221.437,Do you see in advancing that argument any constitutional difficulties of any kind I'm referring to the Seventh Amendment?
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1221.437,1236.057,"No, I don't -- the constitutional question was if any well, gone into the Miller case, footnotes about the various cases at this stage of the --"
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1236.057,1240.013,But I'm talking to the -- about the constitutional right of jury trial.
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1240.013,1246.958,"No, Your Honor, in eminent domain cases they haven't had jury trial."
1969.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1246.958,1248.235,Just as the matter of the statute between the two?
1969.88,0,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,1248.235,1254.56,"Yes, with the rule, I would say."
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1553.127,1555.333,If the Court pleases.
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1555.333,1558.349,Mr. Solomon.
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1558.349,1567.044,"First, I would like to correct that certain statement said, I know were inadvertently inherent."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.714,1687.457,How about the second stage?
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1687.457,1691.418,"The second stage was eliminated, Your Honor."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.418,1692.088,But if --
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1692.088,1696.467,"And erroneously, I want to give the date of that in this particular case."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.785,1766.407,Did I understand you Mr. Solomon to use the term original design and scope of the project as being synonymous?
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1766.407,1767.316,"No, Sir."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1771.895,1772.382,That's right.
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1772.382,1799.095,"If you know the -- if the Court would realize the factual situation in Miller case and then I think the ambiguities of the terminology in the vagueness of the verbiage and phrases in the Miller would be dissipated, knowing the factual situation where in the Miller case, in the original design, they had marked out or designated where they were going to take it right of way."
1969.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1816.843,1823.773,"Mr. Solomon, where are all these maps filed, where'd you find all of this?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1823.773,1827.279,There were no maps filed in this case Your Honor.
1969.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1827.279,1830.054,"Well, I mean where is the original design?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1830.054,1832.78,The design memo was not filed in this case.
1969.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.64,1849.206,"You'll have to get the internal records of some government, departments that's condemning the land, is that it?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1849.415,1850.967,Yes sir and that's why --
1969.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1850.967,1856.821,"And how you discovered what originally was contemplated and what was mapped out and drawn out, is that the way it was?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1856.821,1857.675,"Yes, Sir."
1969.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1887.856,1891.104,"Then they introduced the designs and the technology of things, is that it?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1891.104,1894.35,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1950.89,1978.412,"And if I understand the Miller language, being aside of this specific factual situation in Miller and taking the language, it is that -- if it is land which might or which might not be taken but is ultimately taken, the enhancement of the value by the first stage taking may not be allowed and the jury is to be so instructed, isn't that the Miller held?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,1978.412,1993.239,"Miller has that verbiage Your Honor but then it goes on and says other things that if you're adjacent land owner and this is where you get in trouble for, we're reading the Miller case and I think that's where the trial court reverse itself."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2004.998,2009.882,"Well, but certainly at one category in there, there might or might not be taken there."
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2028.568,2052.83,"Well if you -- that's where our argument is, Your Honor that you have to go back in Miller's factual situation, where it was actually laid out in the original design and marked out and that's what they're talking about that the adjacent land and there shall not be a windfall when it was marked out in the original design it was well known, this was not the case here."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2052.83,2070.013,"Well, the Miller doctrine, the Court goes on to explain that the theory behind that is that the man -- that all of the people should not pay for the value which the taxes of all of the people -- the value which the taxes of all the people have created."
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2071.685,2077.331,"Well, that's one view the Third Circuit held differently."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2077.331,2081.065,"Well, but this is -- I think this is case of this Court, isn't it?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2081.065,2092.067,The Miller case is yes Sir but I think this is what -- there is a variance between the different circuits at this point based on calculation.
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.067,2093.303,In its understanding of the Miller --
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2093.303,2093.793,Misunderstanding of the Miller case.
1969.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2093.793,2095.706,And their understanding of the Miller case?
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2095.706,2098.19,"Yes sir, that's because the vagueness of the language in the Miller case."
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.19,2103.476,"But the Attorney Generals arguments is directed to, he wants us to clear that up?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2103.476,2103.835,"Yes, Sir and we --"
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2103.835,2110.542,And we would like to clear that one way and he wants to clear it up the other way?
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2110.542,2126.34,But we -- we would like to clear it up this way that we're taking the position that where the original design and that's why we have no quarrel with the acreage that was taken below the 566 foot level of the reservoir which is about 172 acres.
1969.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.652,2208.942,"I supposed theirs a difference in the condemnation under eminent domain and that the money of all the people that's involve, public moneys involved and the one private properties involved in the other?"
1969.88,1,23135,erwin_s_solomon,,2208.942,2224.664,"What is the instruction that was given to the jury on the condemnation cases, a fair market value, a willing buyer who is not forced to buy and a willing seller who is not willing to sale and that determines the fair market value."
1969.88,2,41584,shiro_kashiwa,,2909.132,2909.773,No.
