1983.82-1432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,73.612,"Mr. Baliles, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,73.612,77.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.541,195.493,Even if it doesn't bar the injunction?
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,195.493,197.477,--That is correct.
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.27,219.693,"Well, is it your submission or do you take a position as to whether the injunction is permissible?"
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,219.693,228.898,"We would argue that the injunctive relief provisions are not permitted by the doctrine of judicial relief, but as we have pointed out in our--"
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,228.898,233.618,The judge is immune from suit for an injunction as well as damages?
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,233.618,234.668,--That is correct.
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,234.668,235.418,Absolutely.
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,235.418,248.326,"That is the position we maintain although, as we pointed out in our brief, this Court does not have to reach that question in order to dispose of the question of whether attorneys' fees may be authorized and ordered to be paid by the judge."
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.326,251.094,"I understand that, but you have to reach one or the other of them."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,251.094,255.23,"Justice White, this Court--"
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.23,257.014,"It might be easier to reach the other, I mean--"
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,257.014,258.449,--This Court does not have to reach--
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.449,259.349,--If you are right on it.
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,259.349,261.901,--This Court does not have to reach that question.
1983.82-1432,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,299.008,305.68,"Mr. Attorney General, you do have to assume, I suppose, that in some situations prospective relief will be valid."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,309.466,310.632,That is correct.
1983.82-1432,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,324.809,333.164,"Well, couldn't we assume it without deciding it since the only question presented in your petition is the 1988 one?"
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,333.164,335.197,"That is correct, Justice Powell."
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.507,355.578,"We would say if prospective relief is available, attorneys' fees may be awarded."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,355.578,357.63,"Justice White, I would not--"
1983.82-1432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.63,359.732,"If we happened to disagree with you, that's what we would say."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,359.732,362.684,--That is one position the Court could take.
1983.82-1432,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,378.36,380.995,Would that also apply to mandamus?
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,380.995,405.011,"Justice Marshall, in the case of mandamus and writs of prohibition, the legislature has taken the position not only in Virginia but in certain other states that those are writs that are rarely sought, are seldom granted, and are applicable only under very strict conditions."
1983.82-1432,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.819,428.626,"Well, do you think that a judge could award attorneys' fees for a mandamus against a state magistrate?"
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,428.626,432.828,"Justice Marshall, I am not aware of any such authority for that proposition."
1983.82-1432,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,433.78,436.482,Do you know of any authority against it?
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,436.482,437.698,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1432,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,457.812,462.78,My mandamus actually wasn't a civil rights action but just mandamus.
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,462.78,463.549,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1432,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,463.549,466.417,And you can't get attorneys' fees.
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,466.417,467.584,That is correct.
1983.82-1432,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,473.571,474.805,And you don't know of any against it.
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,474.805,476.107,That is correct.
1983.82-1432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.723,530.408,"General Baliles, you said this Court has barred attorneys' fees."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,532.61,533.494,I stand corrected.
1983.82-1432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.931,538.714,Isn't there this possible difference?
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,545.267,551.255,"--That is what the language says, Justice Stevens, but that is not--"
1983.82-1432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.255,553.54,"In other words, the damages have to be paid by the judge himself."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,553.54,555.659,--That doesn't dispose of the problem here.
1983.82-1432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.713,563.146,"Well, it would be a factor to me if I was sued, I'll tell you."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,563.146,563.998,--I beg your pardon?
1983.82-1432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.998,566.115,I said it would be a big factor to me if I was the defendant.
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,568.8,578.841,The suggestion that government or some insurance program would pay a fee award really is not helpful here.
1983.82-1432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.53,592.165,"Yes, but the... but with respect to damages, it's voluntary on the part of the state, as I understand."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,601.604,606.092,"Justice Stevens, many states have reimbursement or indemnification statutes."
1983.82-1432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.748,651.021,"Well, but if the federal statute provides that the fee should be collected from the public agency, can't... won't the judgment run against the government agency so he doesn't have to go hat in hand."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,653.573,659.543,"Well, there is nothing, Justice Stevens, in Section 1988 that requires a state to pay."
1983.82-1432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,668.315,671.367,"Well, was the judgment secured against the Commonwealth?"
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,671.367,675.838,"--The judgment was against the magistrate, Gladys Pulliam."
1983.82-1432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,675.838,678.671,"For fees, for fees, the fee judgment."
1983.82-1432,0,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,678.671,679.29,"Yes, the fees."
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1613.893,1618.381,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1432,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.808,1696.462,What other remedies would your client have had to solve this problem in Virginia?
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1701.098,1719.143,"Justice O'Connor, I think that is a very important question to this case because they could not have sought any other remedy because along with the practice of incarcerating persons for nonincarcerable offenses, they were being appointed no counsel, they were being given no advice of rights, they were being locked away."
1983.82-1432,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1723.797,1728.083,There was no habeas corpus relief possible in Virginia?
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1728.083,1735.837,"There is habeas corpus relief available, as there are appeals, but not for my clients; not when they had no counsel and no advice of rights."
1983.82-1432,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1739.891,1743.093,They could have filed pro se for habeas.
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1743.093,1762.154,"--Had they known how, perhaps, and had time permitted, because these incarcerations were as long as 14 days and as short as 2 days, and I think as this Court has recognized in Gerstein v. Pugh, often these issues will not be heard in time to make them... to make these remedies meaningful."
1983.82-1432,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.154,1772.01,"There is some provision in Virginia law by which pretrial detention orders can be taken up to the next highest court, is there not?"
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1772.01,1773.778,"That is correct, there are appeal--"
1983.82-1432,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.778,1773.995,Was that available?
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1773.995,1778.349,--That was available to them had they had the ability and the time to pursue them.
1983.82-1432,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.422,1844.707,May I interrupt?
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1844.707,1845.623,Certainly.
1983.82-1432,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.623,1847.909,Did I understand you to say the immunity issue wasn't raised?
1983.82-1432,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1847.909,1853.527,The judicial immunity issue on prospective relief was not raised in the lower court.
1983.82-1432,2,25040,gerald_l_baliles,,3381.643,3386.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions, Petitioner waives rebuttal."
1983.82-1432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3386.88,3389.063,"Thank you, Counsel."
