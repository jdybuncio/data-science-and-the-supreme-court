1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.787,And we'll hear arguments next in Navarro Savings Association against Lee.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,78.195,80.904,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.906,179.84,They don't purport to govern jurist -- diversity jurisdiction?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,179.84,180.502,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.222,213.439,No.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,241.943,248.508,"I don't believe we're looking to the Internal Revenue Code, Your Honor, to determine where the jurisdiction lies."
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.407,349.483,But you're talking about the 1887 case now?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,349.483,350.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,350.051,361.686,Do you think the changes in modes of doing business in that time with this was anything to do with how would this case should be viewed?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,361.686,364.842,"None whatever, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,465.802,482.62,"But point you've just said suggested – suggest at least to me, that over the last century the -- the varying modes of business and practices have been reflected in decisions of the courts."
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,482.62,483.583,"This is true, Your Honor."
1979.79-465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.989,558.753,Wouldn't you agree to the place for contraction of the – diversity jurisdiction should be addressed to Congress?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,558.753,573.349,"I don't believe it would represent a contraction, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because the rule traditionally has been that it must be the citizenship of the individual person and not an, aggregations of persons."
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.117,585.547,I take that you think that this decision expanded it?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,585.547,589.31,"I think unquestionably, Your Honor."
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.503,613.329,Is there a Circuit Court case against you?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,613.329,614.719,No.
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.719,616.327,Except to – except the one (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,616.327,617.877,The instant case.
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.555,621.439,About the Second Circuit?
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,621.439,624.404,The Second Circuit has not ruled directly on this issue.
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.274,640.42,"But it gave the limited partnership a separate existence, didn't it?"
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,640.42,641.326,"It did, Your Honor, and it care --"
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.326,648.005,And that traditionally –- and that would have been subject to the individual membership rule.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,648.005,649.588,It should have been and arguably that case is wrong.
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.588,652.723,"That was an -- that was an expansion of jurisdiction too, you think?"
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,652.723,654.882,"We believe, clearly it was."
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.17,762.366,"Well, if we have taken the Second Circuit case and affirmed it, I suppose you would -- would probably be wouldn't even be here."
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,762.366,765.953,"Well, we're –- of course we're here, Your Honor, with all due respect, because the Court granted certiorari on the point of the --"
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.953,769.152,"Well, I know (Voice Overlap) it -- it might not have petitioned."
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,779.05,781.156,It certainly would have a telling effect upon it.
1979.79-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.156,781.889,Yes.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,781.889,782.568,It certainly would.
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.191,836.048,"Where all practical purposes, what do you regard as the differences between a corporation with -- with directors and 9500 stockholders and this situation, practical now."
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,836.048,840.882,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think there are any practical distinctions in the two."
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,840.882,845.83,"That's what the Fifth Circuit seemed to think of, wasn't it?"
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,845.83,848.574,"I think that may be correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.79,866.165,"With that –- that's been going on over the last 100 years hasn't it, to some extent?"
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,866.165,876.889,"I think the decisions of this Court, Mr. Chief Justice, show that when it has reached this Court, the Court has held that the citizenship of the unincorporated association as that of its members."
1979.79-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.633,916.165,One difference I suppose with the union is that – for most its litigation – not every case because Bouligny teaches to the country.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,924.592,924.701,I'm --
1979.79-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.701,931.374,"There isn't an awful lot of litigation by, with unions that requires -- it's based on diversity is there, in the federal courts."
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,931.374,934.044,"I'm -- I'm really not prepared to answer that, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.79-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.82,939.394,Right.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,939.394,940.714,-- company against --
1979.79-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.714,940.77,Yes.
1979.79-465,0,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,940.77,952.233,-- the union which was clearly a state-created right and clearly belonged in the -- in the -- the State unless there was some bona fide basis for them.
1979.79-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1044.151,1046.906,Very well.
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1051.842,1056.035,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.455,1084.448,"That is the test you're proposing, real party and interest."
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1084.448,1087.452,That is I believe that essence of the test.
1979.79-465,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1260.132,1262.842,"You wouldn't have that in Texas, should it?"
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1262.842,1263.713,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand you."
1979.79-465,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1263.713,1266.698,"So you wouldn't have that in Texas, would you?"
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1266.698,1274.854,"Your Honor, I must say that there is that apprehension among some litigants in Texas and I suspect in most of the other States also."
1979.79-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.041,1292.233,"And what basis is that for, to get the same jury?"
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1294.846,1296.652,"Your Honor, I disagree with that."
1979.79-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.85,1335.74,Do you have any formal -- any Article III judge to perform as state judges?
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1335.74,1336.351,"Certainly, yes."
1979.79-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.351,1336.864,Yes.
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1338.204,1338.616,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.905,1341.624,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1341.624,1342.583,Yes.
1979.79-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.363,1360.989,Let's not get discussing what we don't know about.
1979.79-465,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.989,1362.065,No.
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1362.065,1362.833,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-465,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.833,1363.207,That is as --
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1363.207,1364.244,I -- I'd like to move the --
1979.79-465,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.244,1375.984,"-- (Voice Overlap) by my Brother Marshall, if you have a -- if there's diversity of citizenship here, then you have a right to bring your lawsuit in a federal court without showing any prejudice or anything else and if there isn't, you don't."
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1375.984,1376.888,That's correct.
1979.79-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1510.732,1514.117,I assume all these trustees are shareholders?
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1514.117,1520.378,It is alleged that three of the eight are shareholders.
1979.79-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.199,1622.571,"Counsel, when you at least say, “By the court trust,” are you using the term, “trust” to mean Massachusetts business trust as opposed to corporation or individual, as a method of doing business?"
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1622.571,1624.82,I believe that that is the sense in which I'm using the word.
1979.79-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.257,1648.632,Is the trust a -- a person or a thing?
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1648.632,1661.67,"Again, I believe that it is a -- a series of rights and responsibilities between some beneficiaries, some people here, and some trustees, some people over here, and that it is not a thing or a person."
1979.79-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.67,1668.193,"Well, if you had to choose between the two alternatives, Mr. Justice Rehnquist of course, gave you, wouldn't you say it's a thing?"
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1668.193,1671.452,"It is a thing in a sense that of course, it has no citizenship."
1979.79-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.36,1675.345,It's an entity.
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1675.345,1676.325,It is an entity.
1979.79-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.073,1688.186,What does it call itself when it issues things to its shareholders if -- over their interest -- over its interest holders?
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1688.186,1688.333,I believe --
1979.79-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.333,1689.478,Its beneficiaries.
1979.79-465,1,30132,james_a_ellis_jr,,1690.842,1701.879,"It -- if calls itself generally Fidelity Mortgage Investors, using the name of the trust as -- as the thing that is communicating with the trust -- with the beneficiaries."
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2306.761,2310.442,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1979.79-465,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.53,2368.996,"Well, that maybe so but -- but short of that, what power does an individual member have?"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2368.996,2370.824,"The same power, Mr. Justice is that --"
1979.79-465,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.824,2372.56,Is that to vote out the trustees?
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2372.56,2387.956,Precisely the same power which the shareholders of the corporation have and that is by whatever the appropriate majority is to vote out the people that are either defending a lawsuit that they would like compromised or to compel the institution of a lawsuit that they want.
1979.79-465,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.333,2409.399,"But a corporation is a plaintiff or the -- or defendant regardless of who its shareholders or directors, or officers are --"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2409.399,2409.82,"Precisely, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-465,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.82,2411.558,"-- corporation, that's a party."
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2411.558,2416.09,Only by active -- by originally by judicial fiat of this Court by creating --
1979.79-465,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2416.09,2417.244,"And now, by a statute?"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2417.244,2419.542,And now by a statute.
1979.79-465,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2442.64,2449.442,You should think there is a fundamental difference between a labor union and all the other categories we've been talking about?
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2449.442,2462.086,"Only in the sense that the labor union is not organized in the ultimate sense for a financial profit, but it does have as its goal, the distribution of benefits to its membership."
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.924,2727.545,"If decisions are raised on this agreement, give to the trustee's right to file a suit?"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2727.545,2728.854,"Unquestionably, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.854,2732.334,"Well, how do you retain that that be given away?"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2732.334,2735.456,"By simply voting out the trustees, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.456,2740.24,"What I mean, how can you file a lawsuit?"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2740.24,2743.303,I don't follow the Court's question.
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.303,2749.678,"Yes, you delegated the trustees the right to control, to sue and what have you."
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2756.703,2758.508,You mean as individuals?
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.508,2760.831,Yes.
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2760.831,2765.939,Because the delegation is merely the creature of those parties.
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.939,2766.801,"Well, what action have you done --"
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2766.801,2767.383,It doesn't --
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2767.383,2769.763,-- to withdraw that delegation?
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2769.763,2770.814,Because in -- we're obtaining --
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.814,2773.644,Have you withdrawn it yet?
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2773.644,2775.074,They have not because --
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.074,2776.294,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2776.294,2787.509,"-- they have not, but they ultimately as the true parties and interest, if that is indeed the appropriate analysis at all, have that power simply by removing those trustees."
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.351,2789.815,They haven't done it.
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2789.815,2790.641,"No, that's true."
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.899,2793.295,What else can you --
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2793.295,2793.533,But --
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2793.533,2795.536,-- tell me about this one?
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2795.536,2810.504,"I understand it, Mr. Justice Marshall, but I believe that the point is that they may do it in -- in positing that power in the shareholders, you make them no different than the shareholders of a corporation."
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2815.462,2816.603,And there's another difference.
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2825.619,2825.792,But I would --
1979.79-465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.792,2826.979,And you don't have that.
1979.79-465,2,17617,bernus_wm_fischman,,2826.979,2842.258,"I would respectfully submit that that means that you then refer the federal court to the law of the States to determine federal jurisdiction, which I don't believe this Court has ever held, was properly the function of the federal form."
