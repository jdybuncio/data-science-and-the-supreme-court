1991.90-6352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.357,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6352, Diane Griffin v. the United States."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,10.388,14.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,131.886,137.508,"Well, you know if you accept the presumption that the jury follows its instructions, don't you?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,137.508,141.241,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's exactly the point."
1991.90-6352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,170.198,177.804,But doesn't the issue get settled by the instruction on burden of proof and the quantum of proof necessary?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,188.395,195.955,"Well, I believe that approach makes sense if you believe that the jury can recognize the legal insufficiency of the evidence."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.406,282.92,And this in argument there was some evidence?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,282.92,283.905,--There was some evidence.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.905,285.17,But insufficient.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,285.17,286.263,Insufficient evidence.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.263,292.385,"Well, and the Government actually opposed giving the instruction, didn't they?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,292.385,293.432,They actively opposed it.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,293.432,299.446,And they wanted the jury to be told that they could convict on either or both?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,299.446,301.101,"Well, the Government did--"
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.101,303.679,"I mean, if there was evidence beyond a reasonable doubt."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,303.679,309.004,--The evidence told... the Government told the jury that they could convict on either.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.124,333.572,"Why do you think that if the Government opposed the instruction, but nevertheless conceded that there wasn't enough evidence to convict, it may be that both you and the Government were wrong."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,333.572,335.572,"In what way, Your Honor?"
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.572,349.971,"Well, there was evidence and your problem is the jury... you're suggesting that the jury found your client guilty on a basis on which just the Government thought there was insufficient evidence."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,351.907,354.235,The court also thought that there was insufficient evidence.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.735,357.485,"I know, but that isn't the court's job to do that."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,359.421,360.717,"--Well, I would disagree."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,360.717,361.296,Isn't that right?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,361.296,363.669,"No, Your Honor, I disagree with the Court, if you please."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.698,373.744,He never granted your motion.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,373.744,375.805,That is true.
1991.90-6352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.514,419.147,"If you asked someone on the street whether it was more likely that a jury would convict on a count where there was sufficient evidence or on a count where there wasn't sufficient evidence, I suppose the person's answer would be on the count where there was sufficient evidence, don't you think?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,419.147,420.255,"Yes, I do."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,487.059,498.99,"Well, so did the... apparently, so did the judge think it ought to be submitted because he refused your... the judge may have thought, well, if I were a juror, I wouldn't think this was enough evidence."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,503.348,504.159,"Well, I'm puzzled by that myself."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.238,508.878,"Well, he just said that it's my opinion there's not enough evidence."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,513.0,520.184,"Well, on that point, Your Honor, we have the district court's written opinion where the district court says that there was not sufficient evidence."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.732,521.514,That may be what he thought.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,525.292,527.73,"--Well, I think that's why I'm here today, Your Honor."
1991.90-6352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.432,535.773,Is one possible reason that there were other defendants as to whom the evidence was sufficient?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,551.236,565.369,"If I might, on the jury instructions, the court directly instructed this jury according to the statute, and the statutes reads if there is a defrauding of the United States or either of its agencies... or any of its agencies... you may find guilt."
1991.90-6352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.728,571.695,But he didn't say specific... the trial judge didn't say specifically as to Griffin.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,571.695,582.364,"--Well, in the instruction there were three names: Mr. Beverly, Betty McNulty, and Diane Griffin."
1991.90-6352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,616.708,622.207,Did the Government argue in its closing argument specifically that Griffin could be guilty of the DEA or the IRS conspiracy?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,622.207,622.582,Yes.
1991.90-6352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.545,639.527,Did he argue that they could be convicted on... that Griffin could be convicted on either?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,639.527,640.231,--Yes.
1991.90-6352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.231,640.824,Specifically as to Griffin?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,640.824,642.495,Yes.
1991.90-6352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.738,714.779,"Mr. Logan, the question on which we granted certiorari is whether a conviction for a multiple object conspiracy must be set aside when the jury returns a general verdict of guilty and the evidence is insufficient to support one of the objects of the conspiracy."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,721.636,722.277,All right.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.277,731.258,Did the court of appeals judge this case on the basis that there was not sufficient evidence for the drug case?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,731.258,738.146,The court of appeals used the Turner approach to the case and said that Turner applies here.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.127,746.502,I got you.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,752.624,753.265,--That is correct.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.265,755.17,And that's the way the case comes to us.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,755.17,755.889,That is correct.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.889,765.244,And so your job is to convince us that that's then a case where you can't tell what the jury did.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,765.244,766.322,That is right.
1991.90-6352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.322,782.801,"Mr. Logan, in a conspiracy case, typically it's also alleged by the prosecutor that there have been overt acts committed in support of the conspiracy... in furtherance of the conspiracy."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,783.301,783.91,That is true.
1991.90-6352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,783.91,787.359,"Now, would your rule apply there, too?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,797.403,799.667,"Generally speaking, I don't believe that it would."
1991.90-6352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.307,848.961,"Well, normally a statute requires that there be proof of some overt act and furtherance."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,863.424,870.451,I don't believe that it would because what we're looking to is an essential element.
1991.90-6352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.429,931.99,"Mr. Logan, what do you do about Turner v. United States?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,933.365,934.397,"No, I don't."
1991.90-6352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.922,989.625,I didn't read it that way.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1009.726,1010.617,That's correct.
1991.90-6352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.617,1013.396,"You're at least asking us to go back on that... on that statement, no?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1013.396,1019.94,"Well, I'm only asking the Court to apply the rule that I'm seeking if we do not know."
1991.90-6352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.695,1085.46,"Mr. Logan, may I interrupt?"
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1100.72,1102.453,I think that would be correct.
1991.90-6352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.516,1112.403,"So we have to differentiate between cases where there's no evidence on the one hand, and cases where there's some evidence but it's insufficient as a matter of law, on the other hand."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1112.403,1114.715,--I think that that's an approach that this Court can take.
1991.90-6352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.697,1120.492,"But we have to either do that or overrule Turner, I guess is what you're saying."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1147.638,1149.668,That is correct.
1991.90-6352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.668,1159.961,But you say that your rule would apply equally to charges in the conjunctive and an either/or charge.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1161.118,1175.736,"Well, I believe... yes, Your Honor, in Crain, it was early decided that when acts are pled in the conjunctive they're considered to be pled in the disjunctive, so they would always come across as or situations."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.107,1194.135,Do you think the jury understood here that either one would suffice?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1194.135,1194.963,"Yes, I do."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.525,1212.517,"But if... suppose the instruction said that the charge is A and B, and if you find that the defendant is guilty of A and B, why return the verdict of guilty."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1217.594,1229.449,"I think if the jury instruction said you must find guilt on A and B to this jury, I wouldn't be here today because then they would have had to find both, and I wouldn't be standing before this court."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.887,1233.338,I don't know.
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1244.319,1248.911,"Well, no, Your Honor, because if they had found B in this case, that would have been sufficient."
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1256.86,1266.622,"Well, not if the jury was instructed that in order to return a verdict of guilty, you have to find the defendant guilty of both A and B."
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1266.622,1267.012,That's right.
1991.90-6352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.476,1438.943,Where is the instruction that was actually given on this matter?
1991.90-6352,0,36193,michael_g_logan,,1438.943,1440.833,"20, it was Government's instruction 20, Your Honor."
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1779.181,1781.992,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.208,1952.875,I take it... I see the district court also said that the only evidence implicating Griffin related to this... to the IRS object.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1952.875,1953.188,That's correct.
1991.90-6352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.188,1957.936,The Government did not even ague that Griffin had knowledge of the efforts to impair the DEA.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1957.936,1958.342,Exactly.
1991.90-6352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.898,1978.178,What if it had be otherwise?
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1980.85,1981.833,"Yes, Your Honor, we would."
1991.90-6352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.94,1993.546,--I didn't really think we took this to sort of review the instructions.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1993.546,1993.843,--No.
1991.90-6352,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2012.931,2023.442,"Mr. Bryson, wouldn't it be a lot simpler if the Government would simply charge multiple object conspiracies in separate counts?"
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2023.442,2027.612,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that it would not for the following reason."
1991.90-6352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.163,2217.442,But isn't there an exception for cases in which the second ground was one to be constitutionally impermissible?
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2217.442,2220.972,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and that, it seems to me, is at the heart of this case."
1991.90-6352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.862,2231.295,"And what if in such a case, where you have a plain... you know, Stromberg type... a plainly insufficient count as a matter of law, and another one sufficient."
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2237.933,2240.744,"--Well, I think you would have a question of harmless error in that setting."
1991.90-6352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.862,2380.268,"Now that wasn't a conspiracy case, was it?"
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2380.268,2381.533,"It was not a conspiracy case, Your Honor."
1991.90-6352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.533,2387.109,"So it a sense that's dicta, just like the Haupt case got square dicta on the other side, saying the other way."
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2393.152,2393.292,"Yes, of course."
1991.90-6352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.902,2394.605,So we have got one dicta against another.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2394.605,2399.76,--Except that I think Haupt can be distinguished... first of all we think that that--
1991.90-6352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.76,2400.15,Sure it can.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2403.415,2404.618,--It is not a conspiracy case.
1991.90-6352,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2448.725,2452.144,Do you feel that Turner and Yates can stand together?
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2452.144,2453.878,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6352,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2502.39,2505.201,"Well, certainly Turner did not overrule Yates."
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2505.201,2506.185,"No, not at all."
1991.90-6352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2529.003,2536.798,"Well, can one say that there's a legal flaw where evidence is so insufficient that as a matter of law it shouldn't go to the jury?"
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2536.798,2545.138,"Well, that... you can say, of course, that that is... it is a legal error to submit a count on which there is insufficient evidence."
1991.90-6352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2578.702,2580.655,But it isn't the jury's task normally.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2587.574,2595.322,"Your Honor, that's correct with respect at least to cases in which the judge is striking a whole count or a whole charge."
1991.90-6352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2618.159,2619.909,How do you distinguish Cramer?
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2619.909,2629.013,"Well, I think Cramer is a case in which what the Court is saying is there is, with respect to these alleged overt acts--"
1991.90-6352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2629.013,2630.951,That was a piece of the case.
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2630.951,2632.292,"--Well, it was, Your Honor."
1991.90-6352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2667.466,2674.119,"Well, I asked Mr. Logan earlier whether he would extend his rule to overt acts, and he said oh, no."
1991.90-6352,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2683.21,2685.365,"Oh, no, Your Honor, no, in fact--"
