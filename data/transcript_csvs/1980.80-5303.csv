1980.80-5303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.686,We'll hear arguments next in Beltran v. Myers.
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,92.51,95.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.388,127.09,How do you have your federal jurisdiction here?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,127.09,128.465,In the District Court?
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.465,129.605,Yes.
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,129.605,135.306,We had it... we alleged jurisdiction under both 1331 and under 1343.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.862,151.079,"1331 requires $10,000?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,151.079,152.954,At the time this case was brought it did.
1980.80-5303,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,163.34,164.497,Just nitpicking.
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,167.386,168.105,Yes.
1980.80-5303,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,168.105,171.337,"Yes, but where did they find the $10,000?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,171.337,179.882,"For instance, the main plaintiff, Your Honor, has bills to the nursing home in excess of $14,000 because of unpaid nursing home bills."
1980.80-5303,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,179.882,182.599,"In other words, what you're saying is they found it prospectively?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,182.599,189.408,"At the time the case was brought she would not have had bills in the amount of $10,000."
1980.80-5303,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,189.408,194.375,Therefore is there 1331 jurisdiction?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,194.375,204.419,"Well, since the case was still going on at the time that the statute was changed, I would think that even if there was less than $10,000 in controversy when it was brought, she would have had jurisdiction under 1331 in any event."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.419,212.384,Do you think we should treat it as if it had been filed after the amendment eliminated it?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,212.384,217.866,I believe the amendment allowed for jurisdiction in the federal district courts for any case then pending.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.049,247.667,"But then you run into a question, do you not, as to whether this is a proper 1343 jurisdiction case under the Houston Welfare Rights v. Chapman decision of this Court?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,247.667,250.509,That was what the 9th Circuit was concerned about.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.303,264.363,"Well, there is no doubt there's a 1983 cause of action but Thiboutot came from a state court--"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,264.363,265.252,That's correct.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.252,267.783,"--Which is a court, presumably a court of general jurisdiction."
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,282.965,300.083,"Yes, Your Honor, but we did allege both constitutional and statutory claims under 1983, and I think under this Court's decision in Hagans v. Lavine, Chapman did not alter the Hagans v. Lavine decision, so there is pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claims which we raised in the District Court and which are now before this Court."
1980.80-5303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,330.211,335.522,"Now, what's the underlying policy purpose behind that kind of a statute?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,335.522,337.723,The transfer of assets statute?
1980.80-5303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,357.215,367.665,"That sort of pattern has permeated the statutes right back to the original welfare cases 30 or 40 years ago, has it not?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,367.665,368.899,"I believe that's true; yes, sir."
1980.80-5303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,368.899,376.099,Parents can't give their home or their bank account or their stocks and bonds to their children and then go on relief or?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,376.099,402.557,"Well, that was exactly what Congress has said can be done, both with respect to the Federal Government's supplemental security income program, which provides cash assistance and with respect to the categorically needy who are those Medicaid recipients, especially the aged, blind, and disabled, who are eligible for SSI supplemental security income, and are then automatically eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.477,524.008,At what level were these decisions rendered?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,524.008,537.019,"These decisions were rendered from the main offices in Washington, sent out to the regional offices throughout the country, which then have notified the various state administrators on various occasions."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.019,538.658,Can you... are they in the record?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,538.658,544.983,The only... we do not have in the record the original statement which is known as a PIQ.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.645,574.019,"Now, what is a PIQ?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,576.908,578.549,It's not a regulation.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.95,592.402,Can we find it in CFR or?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,592.402,594.745,"No, it's not in the Code of Federal Regulations."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.745,596.026,Where would one look for it?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,596.026,599.806,"Presumably... it's not published, Your Honor."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.592,628.246,Which of those most strongly supports your position?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,628.246,634.557,All of the documents which I'm referring to now state both the general rule and a specific rule.
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.557,635.869,And where are they?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,639.461,645.318,"Well, as I said, none of them are Code of Federal Regulations documents."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.029,668.761,And that's in your blue brief?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,668.761,670.902,"There is a citation to that in the brief, Your Honor."
1980.80-5303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.902,672.478,At what page?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,679.039,680.507,I don't have it but it is in there.
1980.80-5303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,680.507,684.63,What did you say PIQ stands for?
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,684.63,685.833,"Your Honor, I'm afraid I don't know."
1980.80-5303,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,685.833,691.957,"Mr. Deford, somewhere, at your leisure, will you be sure to comment on the Boren/Long Amendment?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,691.957,693.69,"Yes, definitely, Your Honor."
1980.80-5303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.853,947.306,"Mr. Deford, can I ask you a question?"
1980.80-5303,0,25222,gill_deford,,952.756,957.988,I don't think she ever received SSI benefits because I don't think she applied for SSI benefits.
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1815.659,1823.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5303,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1876.4,1878.618,"Mr. Magasin, is it limited to relatives?"
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1878.618,1880.102,"No, it would be--"
1980.80-5303,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.102,1881.679,Any third person?
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1881.679,1882.351,--Correct.
1980.80-5303,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1884.677,1884.974,To children.
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1884.974,1886.458,Children: yes.
1980.80-5303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.458,1890.097,"Mr. Magasin, before you get into your argument, can I just ask you a question about that."
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1902.905,1907.791,To the extent that there would be a transfer.
1980.80-5303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.791,1911.432,And it was deliberate and all the rest.
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1923.912,1933.705,"Well, to the extent they transferred all of their assets and also with the income and resource level requirements of SSI, conceivably they could qualify for SSI and be eligible--"
1980.80-5303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.705,1939.562,"And then if they're qualified for SSI, they automatically get the Medicaid too, even if they got to be qualified by reason of a transfer of assets?"
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1939.562,1940.529,--Yes.
1980.80-5303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.523,1956.633,Right.
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,1956.633,1971.642,The striking down of the transfer of assets rule will in effect serve to benefit the inheritance of relatives and this will clearly be at the expense of the taxpayers.
1980.80-5303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2043.52,2052.733,"Well, didn't your brother tell us that recently a regional director, I think, has advised California that it's not in compliance?"
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,2052.733,2060.185,--In 1978 we received a letter from a regional director advising California that it was in noncompliance.
1980.80-5303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2071.32,2072.539,How long has this case been going on?
1980.80-5303,1,40003,richard_j_magasin,,2072.539,2077.521,"Well, this lawsuit was commenced in 1978."
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3324.563,3325.845,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-5303,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3325.845,3328.376,You have two minutes remaining.
1980.80-5303,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3328.376,3334.89,"Mr. Deford, before you commence, may I ask what relief you now think would be appropriate in light of the amendment to the statute?"
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3334.89,3357.286,"The appropriate relief now would be for the District Court to notify the members of the class of the decision of this Court, if it reverses, and to allow those individuals to apply for the state administrative processes to obtain the amount of benefits which they have been denied by the illegal transfer of assets rule in the past."
1980.80-5303,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3357.286,3360.144,Would you have any problem under the Eleventh Amendment?
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3360.144,3371.687,"No, Your Honor, I think the Quern v. Jordan specifically deals with that issue in which this Court determined that notification does not violate the Eleventh Amendment, where a federal court ordered payment... in that calendar--"
1980.80-5303,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3371.687,3372.312,Is that California--
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3374.25,3375.998,--The state could turn them down?
1980.80-5303,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3378.982,3384.245,"It could notify them to apply, but it could turn them down."
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3384.245,3386.681,"Not on the basis of the transfer of assets rule, Your Honor."
1980.80-5303,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.786,3400.144,But it would be in a state proceeding?
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3400.144,3403.799,It would be for the state proceedings in compliance with Quern v. Jordan theory.
1980.80-5303,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3403.799,3407.829,You also requested declaratory and injunctive relief.
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3415.045,3427.789,"Probably, in light of the fact that this Court could not rule until nearly the time in which the Boren/Long Amendment goes into effect for Medicaid applicants, injunctive relief would only affect a very few number of applicants in the future."
1980.80-5303,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3427.789,3430.929,So your principal reliance would be on reimbursement.
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3430.929,3435.583,"Reimbursement, I think, we would need an injunctive relief order to get reimbursement for the members of the class, Your Honor."
1980.80-5303,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.583,3446.594,Would you have to say anything about the failure to ask for a hearing for a determination to change the presumption?
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3446.594,3449.281,I think the reason we didn't ask for determination is two-fold.
1980.80-5303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.923,3487.53,Are civil cases tried that fast?
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3487.53,3492.326,"Well, it's just that this case was about to go off on cross-motions for summary judgment."
1980.80-5303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3498.793,3500.76,"Well, it's too bad that three months isn't the rule, isn't it?"
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3500.76,3503.479,"--As far as I'm concerned, it is."
1980.80-5303,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.479,3508.164,"The more of those cases we get, the greater will be the span of time."
1980.80-5303,2,25222,gill_deford,,3508.164,3511.287,Thank you.
1980.80-5303,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3511.287,3512.6,"Thank you, gentlemen."
