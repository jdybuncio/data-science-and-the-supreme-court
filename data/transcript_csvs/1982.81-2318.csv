1982.81-2318,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.574,We'll hear arguments next in Florida against Casal and Garcia.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,83.262,86.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2318,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.617,172.179,May I ask you something right here.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,179.316,185.531,"Those boats that travel in the waters and conduct fishing activities in that area, yes."
1982.81-2318,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.531,191.875,And does the absence of a registration certificate give a right for a valid custodial arrest?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,191.875,193.591,I believe it does.
1982.81-2318,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.25,219.421,Is that statute part of our--
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,219.421,227.716,--I believe it is part of the petitioner's reply to the brief in opposition to certiorari.
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,279.868,285.476,--Didn't she also say that really what she was inspecting for was illegal seafood?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,285.476,295.126,"That came... there was a statement to that effect later on, but she was initially going onboard for was for safety inspection and to help them find the papers."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,304.824,311.68,Would it make a difference whether the search was made for safety violations or for illegal seafood?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,311.68,314.008,"The search, the subsequent search?"
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,363.411,365.411,I thought it was putrefying fish or something like that.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,365.411,367.502,--I don't remember it being putrefying fish.
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.05,372.127,It smells the same.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,372.127,373.578,"--Yes, I think it stinks."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,375.485,382.324,"Suppose actually she was inspecting only for illegal seafood, nothing to do with a safety violation."
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,384.417,388.539,"--She has authority... that's part of the scope of their authority, once they're lawfully aboard the boat."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.539,389.147,To inspect for illegal seafood?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,389.147,389.647,Pardon me?
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.647,391.398,To inspect for illegal seafood?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,391.398,403.253,"Part of their function, part of the Marine Patrol function in Florida is to maintain boating safety and to maintain the maritime, the fisheries and control or regulate fishing in the area."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,409.155,411.281,Does the state statute cover all of this?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,411.281,411.593,--Yes.
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,411.593,413.043,No matter what the purpose of the inspection is?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,413.043,423.775,The statute is very clear as to the regulatory responsibilities and the duties of the Marine Patrol with regard to investigating all activities concerning marine life and boating.
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.241,446.407,"As I understand it, there's a state statutory probable cause requirement, whether it's for illegal fishing or for safety violations, is an act?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,446.407,447.421,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.421,450.826,Isn't there a state statutory probable cause requirement?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,450.826,456.152,There's a state statutory requirement to board the boat; 371.58 says--
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,456.152,457.868,Does that require probable cause?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,457.868,462.181,--It requires either consent or probable cause to board the boat for a safety inspection.
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,482.034,494.512,"I know, but if the holding is that there was a probable cause requirement as required by state statute, why doesn't this case turn on an adequate state ground; why do we have to get into it?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,494.512,504.007,--Because the probable cause that the Florida Supreme Court found the search to be in violation of was a Fourth Amendment probable cause finding as opposed to the state statute.
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.261,546.13,"Suppose... if we read what the Florida Supreme Court says, that they turned this on the statutory probable cause requirement, because that's the basis of it,--"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,546.13,547.709,"Well, they cite to two cases."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.365,552.315,"--Well, I know, but both of those were state cases, weren't they?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,552.315,557.735,"They are, but they are not squarely on what we're suggesting is the probable cause."
1982.81-2318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,557.735,567.685,"I'm asking you if we don't read it the way you suggest we should and we find that it did rest on that state probable cause requirement, isn't that the end of the case as far as we're concerned?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,567.685,571.511,"Well, sir, I think... and to answer your question is a yes/no proposition."
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.708,592.191,There's no question that the Florida court thought the stop was all right.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,592.191,592.939,--Yes.
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.939,593.907,And the boarding.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,593.907,595.97,"Pursuant to Delaware v. Prouse, that it just--"
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.97,596.812,And the boarding.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,596.812,598.11,"--And the boarding, yes."
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.11,599.608,So you're legally on the boat.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,599.608,600.032,"Oh, yes."
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.032,602.076,And the only argument that--
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,602.076,603.546,That we're trying to get--
1982.81-2318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.546,606.92,--That you and Justice Brennan are discussing is what occurs after that.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,606.92,607.934,--Exactly.
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.285,634.314,"Is it not correct that insofar as the Florida Supreme Court was talking about the boarding and the stopping, it relied on federal cases."
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,641.2,647.825,"That is true, but I think that is because only of its own practice of citing its own decisions--"
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.518,674.127,But you're asking us to reverse the portion of the Florida Supreme Court's opinion that cites nothing but Florida authority.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,674.127,676.736,"No, I don't believe that's true."
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.434,686.075,"I'm talking about the majority opinion, you're right."
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,686.075,691.698,--They cite to Chimel and they cite to Carroll and they say how could you have done this in this particular case.
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.929,697.571,I suppose the answer is Florida doesn't have to follow those cases if it doesn't want to.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,697.571,714.078,"--Well, that is certainly one outcome, but Florida has been... and there's a host of cases starting with State versus Hetlin that have always... and I repeat always... applied Fourth Amendment in the same way Fourth Amendment is to be applied federally."
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.843,756.637,"Is it your view that in all doubtful cases, we should assume there's jurisdiction?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,756.637,757.14,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.622,760.825,You do agree this is a doubtful case?
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,763.684,772.461,"--I think this is a close case to Delaware versus Prouse, and that case is the case... you've accepted that, and I appreciate that in yesterday's decision."
1982.81-2318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.647,776.567,It supports you.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,776.567,777.207,Yes.
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,794.781,803.01,"When the minority mentions the federal cases and the majority ignores it, what conclusion do I draw?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,803.01,819.411,"That the state was perhaps a little remiss in its briefing of the case because we were concerned with getting the stop found to be okay, and we did not ever think in our mind that we would lose the search."
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,819.411,821.458,I'm talking about the opinions... the majority--
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,821.458,822.519,I am suggesting--
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,822.519,825.424,--does not mention the federal points--
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,825.424,826.033,--That's right.
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.033,831.078,--which were called to their attention by the minority.
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,831.078,831.796,That's right.
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.796,834.108,"So certainly, they read them."
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,834.108,837.528,"They just didn't find them persuasive, I would submit."
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,839.263,843.853,"If they didn't find it persuasive, why should I find it persuasive?"
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,843.853,849.18,--That they ruled on a Fourth Amendment ground as opposed to an independent state issue?
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,855.115,865.862,"My question is that the majority did not rule on the Fourth Amendment point as such, they cited state cases."
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,870.92,871.341,Right.
1982.81-2318,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,872.281,878.933,"So, the state, the majority knew about that, and did not mention it."
1982.81-2318,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,885.617,889.9,"--Your Honor, I don't know... I cannot pretend to understand what you would draw from that."
1982.81-2318,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1131.314,1137.343,Mr. McCormick?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1137.343,1151.447,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1193.554,1198.147,But you're not arguing that the judgment rests on an adequate state ground?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1198.147,1199.723,"Yes, sir, that also."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.723,1202.254,How about the boarding?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1206.535,1221.81,"No, I wasn't totally rejected, as in the brief by the state I was accused of using a thunderbust, and so I'm somewhat restricting my shot right now and eliminating the boarding aspect of it."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.043,1230.571,So we are judging this case as though the boarding was constitutional.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1230.571,1234.35,--The boarding I don't believe was by consent because--
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.35,1236.912,"I know, but was the boarding constitutional or?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1236.912,1240.707,--If it was not by consent then it wasn't constitutional.
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.707,1243.892,"I know, but the Florida Supreme Court has said it was."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1243.892,1248.237,"The Florida Supreme Court, in interpreting the facts--"
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.237,1250.202,Said the stop and the boarding was constitutional.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1250.202,1251.485,--They said that--
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.485,1253.875,You haven't processed an appeal to that.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1253.875,1255.622,"--No, sir, I haven't."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.676,1289.953,"All right, so we judge it as though the boarding was legal and from then on, you say whatever happened was enough to sustain the judgment."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1289.953,1296.435,"Judge, that, if you see that the boarding was illegal, I don't want to disagree with you in that respect at all."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.435,1301.013,"I didn't know that was an issue here, the legality of the boarding."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1301.013,1302.776,"I'm not raising it at this point, Judge."
1982.81-2318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1302.776,1304.23,At this point.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1307.822,1308.149,And this is the last time.
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.373,1332.167,Did you ever challenge the propriety of the arrest?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1332.167,1334.198,"Yes, ma'am."
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1359.093,1362.139,You concede now that the arrest was lawful?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1362.139,1363.387,"No, ma'am."
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1382.803,1388.285,"Mr. McCormick, are you talking about the arrests for not having a registration statement?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1390.095,1391.003,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1391.003,1398.42,"Well, at page 28 I think of your brief you say that those arrests were false arrests."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1398.42,1399.107,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1399.107,1400.359,What did you mean by that?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1400.359,1403.81,By that I mean that they were unlawful.
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1413.023,1416.054,I'm talking about the one for not having a registration.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1416.054,1418.647,--They never perfected that.
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.251,1433.796,You say that arrest was federally infirm?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1437.186,1438.312,No.
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1438.312,1439.467,Constitutionally?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1439.467,1458.145,"I'm saying that it was unlawful by the laws of the state of Florida, and by the same token, if there wasn't probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed when they were arrested for not having the registration papers, by the same token, it would be federally infirm."
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.713,1848.552,"Well, Mr. McCormick, supposing that a state custom agent, state marine officer, has legally boarded the boat and there isn't just a standoff between the captain or whoever it is."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1866.903,1874.885,"Well, if the captain indicated that he should follow, then I would go along with you, but the record doesn't indicate that the captain indicated to him to follow."
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.885,1876.461,"Well, what does the record indicate?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1876.461,1884.911,"The record indicates that once Office Soli got onboard, she immediately commenced to search for seafood products."
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.911,1891.002,"But from your description of how she got to the wheelhouse, it sounds as though she had followed the captain there."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1894.236,1894.61,That's right.
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.872,1912.882,"Well now, the Florida Supreme Court opinion says that in this case, consent was freely given to board the vessel and to look in the icebox."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1924.725,1935.219,"I did not cross-petition, and I believe it's our position that it's not necessary for us to cross-petition based upon the Langley-Cardozo decision."
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.219,1939.608,"Well, you can't ask us to disregard that state court's factfinding."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1939.608,1948.481,"Well, that's the reason why I said I don't want to have our position rely strictly upon the boarding or the illegality of the boarding of the vessel, because of that point."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.901,1954.147,"Well, it can't rest on that point at all."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1954.147,1955.258,--Pardon?
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.258,1957.742,It can't rest on that point at all.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,1963.225,1965.191,I believe so.
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.854,2025.152,"Why, again, do you say it was unlawful?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2028.085,2028.76,No.
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.441,2044.596,So you're saying there was no offense for which--
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2044.596,2045.236,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.236,2048.078,--But didn't the Supreme Court of Florida disagree with you on that?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2048.078,2049.205,"No, it didn't."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.205,2062.01,You say under Florida law he could not have been arrested for not having a boat registration certificate onboard.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2062.01,2063.009,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.009,2069.35,"The Florida Supreme Court opinion, however, says, and I quote, ""They"" meaning the officers,"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2078.459,2084.126,"It's supposed to be onboard a vessel for a motorboard, but this isn't a motorboat."
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2086.578,2087.674,"But they were dealing with this particular case, though."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2087.674,2088.344,"--Yes, ma'am."
1982.81-2318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2088.344,2093.188,And they've told us in this case in that sentence that it was legally required.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2093.188,2098.997,Then I advance this as an argument that was rejected by the Supreme Court.
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.428,2128.549,"But you're unlikely to prevail, whatever you may be able to advance, on an argument that says that the Supreme Court of Florida misunderstood what the Florida police could arrest for, or what was legally required to be onboard under Florida law."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2128.549,2135.482,There's no indication inside of the decision of the Supreme Court that the arrest was lawful.
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.482,2147.696,"Suppose under Florida law it was lawful, that having a registration certificate onboard was required, and that you could arrest for not having it."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2167.309,2168.405,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.405,2172.746,"Now, are you saying that they needed a warrant?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2172.746,2173.479,No.
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.43,2187.771,"Well, they didn't have them."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2187.771,2191.834,They weren't required because it was a documented vessel.
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.834,2194.552,The Florida Supreme Court says they were required.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2194.552,2204.577,They were required by Florida statute as far as... there certainly is a Florida statute that says that motor boats must have registration papers.
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.01,2262.415,"Anyway, the Florida Supreme Court opinion says that he could not... the registration certificate could not be located."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2262.415,2263.881,That's correct.
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.695,2270.924,And after having said that the certificate was legally required to be onboard.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2290.168,2304.553,"If they could arrest for the registration papers, I think next... assuming that was legal for purposes of argument at this stage... is that the next question is would they have the authority to search the vessel."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.817,2370.197,"So you're suggesting, which may be quite right, that under Florida law, even if you need a registration certificate onboard, even if you can be arrested for not having it, you may not search the rest of the vessel, or search the vessel at all, unless you have probable cause to believe you're going to find something besides the non-existence of a registration certificate."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2370.197,2371.398,"I would think, so, yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.398,2372.432,You think that's Florida law.
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2372.432,2373.508,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.209,2380.644,"Well, it isn't."
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2394.297,2415.943,"--Well, that portion of the decision, the last two pages of the opinion in chief, that deals with the aspect of probable cause and the arrest is that if all Florida statutes that they talk about, together with the Hill case and I believe the Taylor case and one other case, and they don't mention anywhere--"
1982.81-2318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2415.943,2421.191,"Is that the premise of your argument that this judgment, then, rests on an adequate state ground?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2421.191,2422.926,"--Yes, sir, it certainly does."
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.584,2459.208,"What happened last year, Mr. McCormick?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2459.208,2463.692,"Well, they changed the constitution and now they're going along with the Supreme Court of the United States."
1982.81-2318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.692,2465.564,Florida changed its constitution?
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2465.564,2466.988,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2318,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2585.408,2589.264,"Well, what were the traps doing there?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2589.264,2591.779,"The traps were onboard the boat, and they--"
1982.81-2318,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2591.779,2595.277,"You said they didn't fish, but what were they doing with traps?"
1982.81-2318,1,16605,arthur_f_mccormick,,2595.277,2597.84,--They stated that they were on the way to the Bahamas.
1982.81-2318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.358,2822.857,Do you have anything further?
1982.81-2318,2,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2822.857,2824.498,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2824.498,2826.869,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
