1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.587,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-942, William Fiore v. Gregory White."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,9.706,13.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-942,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,50.683,68.494,"Well, Mr. Lieber, I suppose that the highest court of Pennsylvania has determined that at the time he committed the offense, it was an offense and that they later interpreted the statute, but didn't give it retroactive effect."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,69.76,73.612,"Respectfully, I'd have to disagree, Justice O'Connor."
1999.98-942,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.587,89.224,"Well, the court had three different opportunities to take up Mr. Fiore's case presumably."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,89.224,90.758,--Presumably that's correct.
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.25,109.035,"Well, but the case became final if they took... did not take it on certiorari."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,119.743,123.379,"My client's conviction is, in fact, final."
1999.98-942,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.179,171.212,"Mr. Lieber, in light of what you've just said and in Justice... in light of Justice O'Connor's question, would your position be different if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had, indeed, held that the law was as the lower courts thought it was; that is, even if you had a permit, if you flagrantly violated it, it was as though you had none?"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,183.602,204.366,"--Only in one situation, Justice Ginsburg, and that would be in the situation, as in Wainwright v. Stone, where the judicial application to the statute over a long period gave consistent notice to our citizens that their conduct would violate... would be violative of the statute in keeping with judicial construction."
1999.98-942,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.512,246.86,"Well, if you... if... if Mr. Fiore had been convicted like, say, 5 years ago under the statute and 5 years later a new case arose with the same kind of facts and was decided as Scarpone's case was decided, would you be here making the same argument?"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,246.86,251.978,"Your Honor, if there had been no intervening law by our State supreme court, I would be making precisely this argument."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.978,252.478,"But, of course--"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,272.741,275.443,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, not necessarily."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.635,288.187,Excuse me.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,290.67,291.139,Taxed.
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.139,291.939,Taxed?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,291.939,292.555,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.959,298.843,"Inconvenienced, you mean."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,298.843,299.609,--Yes.
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.495,304.613,Two things about that.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,315.52,323.61,"Your Honor, there's a good argument I believe for Mr.... for Mr. Fiore because he is presumed innocent under that other section."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,326.193,326.645,"No, no, no."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,341.822,344.874,"They should have tried him under that other provision, and they did not, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.874,345.19,All right.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,347.559,351.51,"It is a case, in fact, of innocent conduct of the charge that was charged."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.51,352.393,"Well, I recognize that."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,355.662,356.997,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.139,370.655,All right.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,394.872,405.745,"I'm not exactly sure that... that it would be, Your Honor, because I believe it would be then the same position as in... in Wright v. West, where we would still test."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,410.982,432.729,"No, but your sufficiency claim, as I understand it, is essentially a claim that the evidence was insufficient simply because it was, under Pennsylvania law, evidence that could not, as a matter of logic, as a matter of law, prove the... the offense that he was charged with, i.e., operating without a permit, as opposed to operating in violation of a permit."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,481.228,482.795,"No, that's not the argument we're making here."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,482.795,483.197,Okay.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,495.905,500.726,"Your Honor, I... I can't admit that because Teague only applies to procedural matters."
1999.98-942,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.928,518.085,"But why would the situation be any different than if we had a legislature saying the permit is not an essential element, and then the legislature changed that to say it is?"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,546.438,550.057,"Your Honor, that... that is not my position."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.832,598.889,"Bousley, however, was a Federal... construing a Federal statute where the... perhaps the case law may be somewhat different than just stepping into a State situation."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,598.889,609.328,"Your Honor, but our case law in Pennsylvania is identical under recently decided Pennsylvania Supreme Court authority in Commonwealth v. Shaffer."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.509,633.044,"Well, if... if the Pennsylvania law supported you, you should have gotten relief in Pennsylvania."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,636.68,637.013,No.
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.584,646.702,That's... that's a somewhat pejorative description.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,646.702,648.002,I apologize.
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.002,651.004,"Mr. Lieber, I think you misstated the holding in Shaffer."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,659.343,661.128,"I stand corrected, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.128,662.478,Which makes a world of difference.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,662.478,662.978,It does.
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.847,681.392,"Mr. Lieber, most of the cases that we take in this Court are cases that involve circuit conflicts, disagreements in the law, in final decisions in most cases, some of them years ago."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,699.253,699.986,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.692,733.242,"Well, take that kind of a situation, limited to those cases where we have interpreted a substantive statute in a certain way, and one set of courts in cases, some of them decided years ago, have interpreted that same statute a different way, which would... which would make a conduct that we have held to be innocent in fact guilty."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,738.729,751.369,"--I would say no, Your Honor, because if you had made a decision on this Court, that would be a decision that... that those convictions earlier were within the scope of the Constitution, whereas later they were not."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.055,753.355,Excuse me.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,756.69,756.94,--Well--
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.94,758.106,There are two sets of cases.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,779.803,784.257,"--I would say, Your Honor, that... that a habeas writ would lie if you decriminalized behavior."
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.257,789.059,"Mr.... Justice Scalia is asking you whether you think Bousley was correctly decided, I think."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,789.059,790.177,"Absolutely, yes."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.735,823.382,"But Bousley... the... you can... our cases say you can get relief from a Federal conviction on habeas because of an error in statutory law, and the... the same is not nearly as clear when you're talking about a claimed error in State law."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,823.382,836.992,"Mr. Chief Justice, I... I agree except when the error in State law is also an error of Federal constitutional dimension."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.992,844.129,But we don't have any evidence from any statement of a Pennsylvania court that there has been an error in Pennsylvania law.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,844.129,865.059,"We have... we have a statement, Your Honor, from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court both... excuse me... from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scarpone case that there was an error of State law, a misconstruction of the statute which in fact was also a Jackson error, although the State admittedly did not say Jackson."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.815,875.017,"Well, the State court didn't have to get into Federal constitutional law."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,882.104,883.337,"I agree, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.337,921.062,"If the State court holds that the statute, as they construed it, clearly, inarguably, always meant that, that there was no room for reasonable disagreement, that somebody had just made an inexcusable error in construing it otherwise in prior cases, when that happens, which you are claiming happened here, then you win because you can take advantage of the settled Federal rule to the effect that every element has got to be proved."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,927.3,933.806,"And that is precisely the narrow holding in this case that would only release one person, as far as I know, that we're asking for--"
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.806,945.011,"Why is that any worse than the situation where you have a lower State court that... that clearly, unarguably, whatever... whatever other adverbs Justice Souter used--"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,975.466,977.616,"--No, Your Honor, of course not."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,983.452,990.892,"No, but you... when you say insufficiency of evidence, you're talking about evidence that, as a matter of law, cannot prove an element of an offense."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,991.375,991.908,Correct.
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,991.908,1001.783,"So... so, your real argument is they... that you take advantage, in effect, of the Winship rule or you... you refer to it by... by citing Jackson."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1022.779,1023.479,Correct.
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.479,1043.86,"It seems to me the issue in this case is whether when the supreme court decided your client's... or rather decided the other... your co-defendant's case, whether it was stating what the law was at the time the statute was enacted or whether it was changing the law from an intermediate court view that prevailed in the interim."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1043.86,1048.162,It was stating the law from the time it was enacted.
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.162,1054.649,And you say Pennsylvania's supreme court has said that's what... what the view is on the first construction of a statute.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1054.649,1055.335,"Correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.335,1057.151,Suppose it were the other way around.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1066.373,1081.033,"At that time, Your Honor, I would say that... that a Federal court could... could look to that intermediate ruling as datum for a... a construction of what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court might or might not say later."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1081.033,1081.485,All right.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1086.537,1099.964,"If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said the decision was prospective only, I think that... that a Federal court would have to defer to it, but would have to have the final say on the constitutional meaning of the decision."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1102.065,1105.7,You mean the final say on whether or not there's a due process violation--
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1105.7,1106.35,--Correct.
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.35,1107.017,--for--
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1107.017,1108.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.135,1113.956,"--Of course, if they said it was prospective only, then your co-defendant would remain in jail."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1117.075,1117.708,Yes.
1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.708,1119.375,And would have both been treated alike.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1119.375,1119.86,Correct.
1999.98-942,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1119.86,1120.343,Yes.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1135.287,1142.857,That's the only case.
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1142.857,1145.908,And even Wainwright and Stone was a notice vagueness case.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1145.908,1146.225,Yes.
1999.98-942,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.277,1152.062,"Mr. Lieber, there's no equal protection claim being made here--"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1152.062,1153.264,"Not at this time, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.264,1159.152,--Bousley was... was decided under current habeas law.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1199.562,1200.312,That's correct.
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1200.312,1204.097,But you would also say that it would be irrelevant to this case.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1204.097,1205.147,"That's also correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1248.793,1249.41,I understand that.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1249.41,1249.995,Quite the opposite.
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.995,1254.714,Every... every State court decision that is unreasonable on the facts is unconstitutional?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1256.999,1257.616,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.616,1258.282,--many years later?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1258.282,1259.268,"No, no."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.268,1260.701,"Well, what does that have to do with it then?"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1260.701,1273.443,"Well, I would say if... if we're in an actual innocence situation with a fundamental defect going to the truth-finding function of the trial, then I would say every case."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1273.443,1275.027,You keep broadening--
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1276.812,1279.597,"Not... no, Your Honor, not if it were simply a procedural matter."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.597,1292.489,"Oh, but if it's a substantive matter, you say every case where the defendant says the factual finding was simply unreasonable, you can bring a Federal habeas action, a successful one, on the basis of the Federal Constitution."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1292.489,1293.122,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.072,1325.543,The thing that I don't understand about your argument is... and it goes back to my earlier question.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1403.328,1404.812,Allow me to clarify.
1999.98-942,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1427.127,1433.597,"Mr. Lieber, do I understand correctly that what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did was lay down the law?"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1461.499,1473.139,"--I think that's a correct statement, and I think it's... it's emphatically a correct statement with regard to the lower court decision in Commonwealth v. Fiore."
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.466,1520.97,"And you want us to assume that under Pennsylvania law this decision, the Scarpone decision, is retroactive--"
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1520.97,1522.072,I want you--
1999.98-942,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.072,1523.139,--under Pennsylvania law?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1523.139,1527.976,"--Under Pennsylvania law, it is a... retroactive is the best word we have."
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.169,1547.355,What was your client sent to jail for if it was not for a violation of Pennsylvania law?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1547.355,1548.907,"My client, Your Honor--"
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.907,1554.043,You're... you're telling me the... the Fiore decision doesn't mean anything simply because it can't be cited in future cases.

1999.98-942,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.793,1584.776,That's the issue.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1587.278,1588.597,--I don't think--
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.597,1588.947,"--No, no."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1600.655,1601.338,--Your Honor--
1999.98-942,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.338,1603.523,Why was Pennsylvania sending him to jail then?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1603.523,1607.325,"--Because Pennsylvania was in grave error at that time, Your Honor, in one... one case."
1999.98-942,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.325,1608.492,One court was.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1627.972,1628.755,No.
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1632.107,1638.178,But what if the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in that... in the Scarpone case had said this decision is not retroactive?
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1638.178,1650.236,"I... I believe you... that a Federal court would have to defer and look to that, but in that case, which is not this case, it would still have to apply Jackson and Winship standards in a sufficiency claim."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.354,1653.79,Very well.
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1653.79,1654.323,Thank you.
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.323,1655.006,"Very well, Mr. Lieber."
1999.98-942,0,31445,james_b_lieber,,1655.006,1655.689,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.689,1657.441,"Mr. Graci, we'll hear from you."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1657.441,1664.262,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.829,1700.952,"Now is... don't you, in making that statement of the question, assume that it was... that the law changed when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania made its decision in the other case?"
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1700.952,1702.47,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.093,1724.567,"Supposing in that opinion they had said, this is our understanding of what the statute means and they had added a sentence, and we think it has meant this ever since it was enacted, then you would lose, I take it."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1724.567,1742.362,"No, we would not, Your Honor, because, while I agree with what my opponent said with respect to the Ettinger case, which was a Third Circuit case interpreting Pennsylvania law with respect to the retroactive application of new decisions interpreting State statutes, it didn't go far enough."
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.666,1749.801,But he also cites the Shaffer case.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1749.801,1750.451,And Shaffer.
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.541,1819.714,"There's no question that if this was a law-changing decision, if there had been a prior decision going the other way, then you would win."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1849.15,1854.368,"Your Honor, based on your interpretation and your statement relying on Rivers and the Bousley case--"
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.368,1854.735,Right.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1854.735,1857.487,"--that would be correct, as I understand the decisions of this Court."
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.782,1877.901,They specifically said it would not be... it would not be retroactive... because it was a law-changing decision.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1877.901,1890.727,"Well, what they were interpreting... I don't think they... they announced or said what the rule was in Kuchinic, but in Shaffer they wouldn't have had any reason to say it because Shaffer was there while on direct appeal."
1999.98-942,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.727,1904.385,"Am... am I right, Mr. Graci, in thinking that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania granted review in Scarpone's case because there was a split between the Commonwealth court and the superior court as to the meaning of the statute?"
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,1904.385,1907.837,"You're absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and they said that at least twice."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1995.711,2008.637,"Well, Mr. Graci, I quite agree with you that Pennsylvania, as a matter of... of State procedure, will... will not apply the decision, we'll say, retroactively, in quotes, to... to this case."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2066.741,2069.926,"In... not entirely, Justice Souter."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2137.403,2149.145,"Right, and the hypothetical that... or I guess the question that I'm asking you is, is this in a third category in which it was a new decision in the sense that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had never ruled on it before?"
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2160.019,2162.22,"--I guess, as I--"
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2162.22,2173.093,"Is... is it... is it a law-changing decision when it is, A, the first one and, B, the court in making the first decision says, anything else would be a bald fiction?"
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2175.028,2179.664,"--I believe the answer, Justice Souter, is no."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2183.801,2186.503,"I think the shorter answer was the better one in that case, but--"
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2193.24,2203.262,"--Well, I guess if we have to use your words, it's a changing decision because you say it is, but it's a new decision under Pennsylvania's law."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2203.262,2206.798,It's... it's new simply because they had never taken up the question before.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2208.583,2215.503,"Well, it's new because it was a... a... in the State supreme court, an issue of first impression, the answer to which was not clearly foreseeable."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2215.503,2231.698,"Yes, but every issue... you're assuming that every... I think, every issue of first impression presents a new decision... or rather, announces new law for the purposes of a Federal court in applying the Winship rule."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2233.165,2235.317,Not--
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.317,2242.904,Any... any first decision of the State's highest court is announcing new law for purposes of Winship.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2244.339,2246.223,"--No, Your Honor, that's not the assumption."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2246.223,2246.708,Okay.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2246.708,2262.817,"If there was nothing that had gone before, so that by announcing that whoever made a decision, it could be questioned, but in this case... then I could agree with your premise."
1999.98-942,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.817,2263.65,"Yes, but it cannot always be questioned."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2299.509,2304.227,"I... I submit to Your Honor that it may be a fair reading, but not necessarily the only reading."
1999.98-942,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.227,2308.929,Is... is there anything in our cases that defines the term law-changing decisions?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2308.929,2310.131,"Not of which I'm aware, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.131,2311.147,I didn't think so.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2335.412,2337.864,Well... I'm sorry.
1999.98-942,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.931,2339.298,No.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2352.058,2352.741,I--
1999.98-942,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.741,2357.093,Do you think that would have been a law-changing decision or not a law-changing decision?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2357.093,2364.266,--I think it would have been a decision establishing the law by the highest jurisdiction of the Commonwealth in that instance.
1999.98-942,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.752,2373.287,Do you think Justice Souter would consider it a law-changing decision?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2374.137,2374.821,--No.

1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.459,2491.679,Kuchinic seemed to be a case in which they simply assumed... and it was a new rule.

1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.106,2507.573,--Okay.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2507.573,2509.891,222 Atlantic 2nd 897.

1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2536.174,2536.724,--I'm sorry.
1999.98-942,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2536.724,2556.021,"--If you... if you took it in the context of what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said in this case, first, they said, no doubt these people have engaged in execrable conduct, but the one thing that they clearly have not done is operate without a permit."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2616.993,2619.928,"That is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-942,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.233,2657.97,"Mr. Graci, so much of this seems to turn upon what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought it was doing."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2668.576,2672.312,"It's my recollection, Justice Scalia, that they've recently adopted one."

1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2698.88,2700.147,The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said--

1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2702.432,2705.717,--But we don't apply our rules back to final cases.
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.717,2707.417,It doesn't say anything about that.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2707.417,2710.686,"Okay, that's not Pennsylvania's rule, as I understand it."

1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2731.182,2733.367,Because the judgment is final?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2733.367,2734.301,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2734.301,2750.246,"Suppose there is a decision of this court, some other factual situation, in which the conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and he has a final conviction is declared constitutionally protected and he's picketing or something like that."

1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2780.098,2781.715,--Well--
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2781.715,2786.752,--Then what would you do with a prisoner who has been convicted and whose conviction is final?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2786.752,2818.39,"--If the conviction... if the Court's ruling, Justice Kennedy, was that that type of private primary conduct is removed from the criminal law making authority to proscribe, which is the first exception to Teague, then the State courts under Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation would be required to follow this Court's rule and would be required, since it would be within Teague's first exception, to apply that constitutional decision."
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2818.39,2820.592,Why should this case be any different?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2820.592,2831.965,Because this... the rule in Scarpone is not a rule that removes private primary conduct from the criminal law making authority of the States to proscribe.
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2849.592,2865.621,"From the standpoint of the prisoner, what's the difference between prisoner A, whose conduct was constitutionally protected, and prisoner B, whom we'll assume by... by hypothesis committed an act which was never criminal under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania?"
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2866.621,2874.394,"As to him, the only difference is the rules of finality that this Court has embraced in adopting its... its habeas jurisprudence."
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2874.394,2879.881,I'm talking about what... what your position is and what the law of the State of Pennsylvania is in these two cases.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2879.881,2894.205,"I believe the law of the State of Pennsylvania is that, as to the conviction that was final on appeal... when you say it was never criminal, in Fiore's case... and this is where I have to beg to differ with the Court, it was criminal because--"
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2894.205,2901.894,I want you to assume that it was... that the State supreme court said the statute has always meant that you must have a permit.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2920.673,2930.396,--The difference is the first case is conduct that the Constitution has always prohibited from being made criminal.
1999.98-942,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2979.127,2981.663,I just... I recognize we're here under Teague.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,2999.991,3013.384,"--Well, it would only be a difference under State law if this Court, as the final arbiter of what the Constitution says, says that in the one instance it could never be... it could never be prosecuted."
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3079.927,3082.129,Might I just interrupt?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3107.012,3111.131,"Your question, Justice Stevens, is in two parts."
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3111.131,3111.598,Yes.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3111.598,3124.641,"Obviously, the answer to the first question is yes, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has now said, as the final arbiter of Pennsylvania's law, that this statute is in two parts, and if you have a permit, you can't be convicted of it."
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.26,3140.067,And your... your submission is that there was a period of time under this statute where it was a violation of the statute even though the person had a permit.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3140.067,3145.971,"--Yes, if, as in this case, he significantly departed from the specific terms."
1999.98-942,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.279,3175.24,Do you think that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court can simply prescribe whether things will be retroactive or not and thereby affect Federal constitutional proscriptions?
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3200.789,3201.724,"No, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-942,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.581,3256.358,"It seems a very fragile, indeed useless constitutional protection if it can be avoided by the State supreme court by simply the supreme court saying, ah, Fiore... since we want Fiore held in jail and other people in Fiore's position, we're just going to announce that this one is not retroactive."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3258.577,3261.862,It would be a fragile constitutional protection if the State courts could do that.
1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3313.511,3315.147,"Well, as an indicator."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3362.878,3364.746,"--I think I understand it, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.98,3373.268,"I couldn't find any, which suggested to me that it was really the unusual case that's non-retroactive."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3373.268,3376.303,"--The... well, Shaffer, or Shaffer--"
1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3376.303,3382.041,"Yes, there are some, but normally if it's not going to apply as the law forever, the State supreme court will say it."
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3382.041,3382.674,"--Well, but--"
1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3382.674,3383.774,Normally they'd say it.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3383.774,3384.591,--What I have found--
1999.98-942,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3384.591,3385.076,It's an unusual thing.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3385.076,3385.559,--I'm sorry.
1999.98-942,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3434.723,3443.562,I think I should make one thing... I don't think anybody is considering overruling Sunburst which was a civil case and which... which specifically said it was a new rule.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3449.382,3450.199,--I see my red light is on.
1999.98-942,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.699,3450.982,Yes.
1999.98-942,1,39325,robert_a_graci,,3453.901,3454.901,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.98-942,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.901,3457.769,"Mr. Lieber, you have 2 minutes remaining."
1999.98-942,2,31445,james_b_lieber,,3457.769,3461.405,"In that time, Your Honor, I'd just like to make a couple of points."
1999.98-942,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3495.644,3508.619,"Mr. Lieber, does it cut in either direction that Fiore did try to get the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to focus on his case, what, four times and every time they just denied... they denied review."
1999.98-942,2,31445,james_b_lieber,,3512.189,3525.097,"Your Honor, I would submit that... that if it counts at all, it counts very slightly and only to the extent that there... it shows the necessity for habeas review in a Federal court."
1999.98-942,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3533.369,3541.607,"Well, if he hadn't even tried to put it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, perhaps there would have been some question about exhaustion or waiver, but he did try a number of times."
1999.98-942,2,31445,james_b_lieber,,3541.607,3541.875,Yes.
1999.98-942,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3547.946,3560.603,But it does suggest a view of the Pennsylvania court that it doesn't apply its new decisions to cases that have become final.
1999.98-942,2,31445,james_b_lieber,,3568.526,3571.092,--I would respectfully disagree.
1999.98-942,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3588.754,3596.526,"Well, presumably that... that idea must have occurred to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the petition for certiorari, and they nonetheless denied it."
1999.98-942,2,31445,james_b_lieber,,3596.526,3597.795,"--Your Honor, my time is up."
1999.98-942,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3597.795,3598.295,It is.
1999.98-942,2,31445,james_b_lieber,,3599.945,3600.997,"Thank you, Your Honor."
