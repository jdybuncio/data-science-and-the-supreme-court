1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.916,We will hear arguments next in Oralia Martinez against Raymon Bynum.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,60.142,63.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.741,131.113,"Mr. Tuddenham, where in your brief is that statute set out?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,131.113,138.862,"It is set out... Your Honor, I believe it's on page 2 of the brief."
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.18,166.662,"Well certainly, the statute can serve some legitimate purposes, can't it?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,185.391,188.468,"Well, there are several answers to that."
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.681,208.679,"No, I'm assuming that the parents don't want to pay the school taxes in the high taxing district, but they want their child to be educated there and they're perfectly willing to have the child take up legal residence with a step-sister."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,208.679,221.11,"--If the child, in fact, moves and establishes a residence with a sister in another school district and residence is the criteria for admission to school, then I should think that that child would have the right to attend school."
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.943,247.818,But doesn't the state have a perfectly legitimate interest in seeing that what you say the statute doesn't prohibit doesn't happen?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,247.818,259.47,"The state has an interest in protecting its schools from excessive problems of migration, but it can't do that by prohibiting migration."
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.351,287.691,"But the fact that New York and Pennsylvania might allow parents to do this doesn't mean that Texas, under the Constitution, has to allow it, does it?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,287.691,296.281,"Well, I would argue that if the child has a right to travel and a right to establish his home in another district, then he can."
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.859,333.471,"You would argue, then, that if I'm a parent and live in a very wealthy school district and my 14-year old child... rather, I'm a parent who lives in a poor district but I want my child to go to a district where there is a good deal better education because of a high tax rate but I don't want to move into that district because I don't want to pay the high tax rate, so I simply farm my child out to a step-sister in the high tax rate district, that the state can't prevent that under the Constitution, because a 14-year old child has a right to travel from one school district to another?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,333.471,335.358,"--To establish a new home, yes."
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.593,348.449,"Do you think the child has a right, independent of the parent, if the child is unemancipated, to establish his own residency independently--"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,348.449,363.582,"Perhaps, again, where there is a choice between school districts, there might be some grounds for limitation, although I think if there are going to be limitations on a child's constitutional rights as opposed to an adult's, it must have something intrinsic to do with the child, some disability of the child."
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.298,379.419,--What is the general test of residency for school purposes in Texas?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,379.419,383.575,--The only test for school residency in Texas is de facto residence.
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.994,393.929,What do you cite for that?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,393.929,413.625,"--Well, the statute itself simply refers to residence, but last year in Plyler versus Doe the state argued that... I believe the example was someone coming from Virginia for six months could bring their child and stay for six months with the fixed intention to return to Virginia, and during that six months they would be--"
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.625,415.891,Other than the arguments in Plyler.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,415.891,422.855,"--There is also evidence in the record, Your Honor, in the school applications that were submitted as Plaintiff's Exhibit 8."
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.456,449.5,What do you say the state does prohibit that it can't?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,449.5,459.417,What it prohibits is... the state says that a child can establish residence apart from its parent or guardian for any reason it wants to.
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.713,513.289,"Yes, but I suppose if district-hopping is what they want they may have a tough time coming up with a phony reason that passes muster."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,513.289,522.019,"Well, the district court found that any reason would suffice; any reason other than the desire to obtain an education."
1982.81-857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.019,535.746,"But if, in fact, the reason is the desire to obtain an education, I suppose that whoever decides whether the reason is true or not would make some inquiry into that."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,535.746,540.34,"Well, there is inquiry into what is your purpose for being here."
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,561.611,563.767,"Counsel, may I ask you a question?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,570.295,579.074,"--Well, in the district court we amended our complaint to drop the claim that the statute is being discriminatorily applied."
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,579.074,584.759,"So you're not arguing that the statute has been applied discriminatorily, are you?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,584.759,585.57,That is correct.
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,586.618,590.912,"And Judge Garza found as a fact that it was not being so applied, didn't he?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,590.912,596.411,"--I believe his finding was that if you had any other reason for getting in, they would let you in."
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,598.801,601.549,"He didn't find any discriminatory enforcement, did he?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,601.549,603.484,--That was not presented to him.
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,615.042,623.586,"But on the face of the statute, it applies equally to children coming from Mexico as it would to children coming from any other school district in the state, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,623.586,625.399,"--Absolutely, it does."
1982.81-857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,643.906,659.368,"Counsel, I was going to ask exactly the same question, because I think the record for me is somewhat confusing as to whether you were making a facial or an as-applied challenge, and I take it your answer to Justice Powell is that now you're making a facial challenge."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,659.368,661.743,"It is a facial challenge, but on its face--"
1982.81-857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,661.743,664.897,"What do you do, then, about the boarding house situation?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,664.897,667.413,--Boarding home situation?
1982.81-857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,702.805,711.333,Does the record show that this petitioner intends to stay in the United States after he's been educated?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,711.333,717.097,The record states that he intended to stay until he completed his high school education.
1982.81-857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,726.825,732.449,"Well, this takes us right back to the question I think that was implicit in something that Justice O'Connor asked."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,737.51,742.038,I think this has to be looked at... it's a family situation.
1982.81-857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,793.344,799.049,"I suppose it's irrelevant, but how did he happen to be born in the United States?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,799.049,810.386,"That is not in the record, although the way this comes up is the parents are either here temporarily... Mexican parents are either in Texas temporarily on visas or they're here illegally."
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.028,849.341,What would be your argument if the child was not a citizen.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,849.341,858.291,"Well, if he were entering, say, on a visa, say, if the federal government had granted him a permanent residence visa--"
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.291,859.305,"No, not permanent."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,863.036,870.924,"--Well, if he came in legally, under the federal immigration laws I should think that there would be a supremacy problem for the state then--"
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.924,872.878,"Well, you'd be making the same argument, wouldn't you?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,872.878,876.485,--If he had entered legally I would be making the same argument.
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.509,898.21,"So the fact that this child is a citizen is rather irrelevant, isn't it?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,898.21,905.424,Only that his right is not a supremacy right of immigration; it's that he is a citizen.
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.253,910.984,"Well, it's irrelevant to your argument."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,913.188,922.137,"Well, perhaps if he is entering illegally for the purpose of attending school, the state could draw a narrower statute to exclude those children."
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.137,923.732,Under Plyler?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,923.732,940.645,"Well, there is a footnote in Justice Powell's concurrence with respect to if the child is entering for the purpose of attending school, then you could make a pretty good logical argument that excluding him would be consistent with the federal policy of deterring immigration."
1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,957.763,962.778,To what extent do you rely on a constitutional right to travel?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,962.778,973.525,It is our argument that this case should be reversed based on the same equal protection analysis utilized in Doe v. Plyler.
1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,982.175,993.892,"So you must be taking the position that a child of three, four, five, six years of age has the same constitutional right to travel as an adult citizen."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,993.892,1000.326,"Obviously, children's rights, to a certain extent, are not co-extensive with an adult's rights."
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.389,1041.824,"Texas doesn't object to the right to travel back to Mexico, does it?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1041.824,1043.306,"--No, it does not, Your Honor."
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1097.206,1109.36,Do you think that the state has a legitimate interest in requiring children who are living apart from their parents to live with a legal guardian as a pre-condition to admission to public school?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1109.36,1115.092,The state has a legitimate interest in assuring that the child lives with a responsible adult.
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1124.26,1135.315,"You think it would be valid for a state to say if the child is living apart from the parents, we require as a condition of going to school that the child be living with a legal guardian?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1135.315,1137.784,--It would depend on their reason for requiring that.
1982.81-857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1139.754,1142.986,"Well, what can we assume?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1154.857,1164.524,"Absolutely a state has interest in doing that, but if the state law will allow a custodian to do all of those things as it does in Texas, then the guardian would not be needed for those purposes."
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.524,1172.019,"Does the record show, when this child was admitted, what did the sister sign on the application blank?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1175.954,1179.027,"No, there were no admission cards at the time that this child was--"
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.027,1180.107,--They have no records?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1180.107,1187.992,The only records that were kept were kept by the order of the District Court and that was after Roberto Morales--
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1187.992,1193.128,--Then what records does the school have as to who to call up if the child drops dead?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1193.128,1198.529,"Oh, the child is in school now, they have his sister, Oralia Martinez's name."
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.529,1200.9,"As what, guardian?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1200.9,1201.747,As custodian.
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1201.747,1202.714,Custodian.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1202.714,1206.711,I think the way it's referred to in the statute is person having lawful control.
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1206.711,1210.24,--I'm not interested in the statute; I'm interested in this case.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1226.875,1230.497,So far as the school is concerned she is not a disinterested passerby.
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1230.497,1232.56,"Well, is that in the record?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1232.56,1239.431,"It is in the record that the state schools accept children who live with relatives, or friends even."
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1239.431,1248.132,"Well, does it show that she signed as a relative, as a parent, as a substitute parent, or what?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1248.132,1276.746,"When a child applies to school... it's not in the record, but I imagine that they would get the name of the parent, or whoever the child is living with, and... but what I would show the Court is that it is clear under the statute and through the applications kept in the... as Plaintiff's Exhibit A... that the school districts do admit children if they are living with non-guardians; with relatives or friends."
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.131,1295.424,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1299.971,1300.892,That is correct.
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.578,1303.079,"Is that pursuant to court order, or how does--"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1303.079,1304.217,--It's an injunction pending appeal.
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.86,1308.858,--I had missed that in the papers.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1308.858,1315.277,He was out of school for a year and then the injunction came and he was admitted.
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.277,1320.057,And the court of appeals left that injunction in force and has not ruled against you.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1320.057,1320.494,That is correct.
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1320.494,1321.368,I see.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1344.826,1350.886,"In the first place, a child's right to travel is obviously limited by the parents' wishes."
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1350.886,1354.244,"Well, perhaps not in this case, but there may be many similar cases."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1354.244,1357.976,But I would suggest to the Court that that--
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1357.976,1360.054,Let's take my simple question.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1385.108,1390.591,"--Well, let me answer that first by saying that is not necessarily the case before the Court here."
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1392.947,1393.321,I know.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1393.855,1394.573,Okay.
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1436.071,1448.3,"But you have people here in your case who are perfectly willing... if they were willing to accept the child, the child could attend the schools."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1451.19,1453.066,If they were willing to become guardians.
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1453.066,1453.83,Yes.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1453.83,1468.402,"Even if they were... there are problems with the guardianship requirement in Texas in that it could mean giving up permanent custody of the child, such that it would require a second proceeding to get custody of your child back."
1982.81-857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1478.865,1479.804,Do you have legal aid in this county?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1479.804,1491.285,"There is legal aid, Your Honor, but as the people are rejected under... in Plaintiff's Exhibit A, the 30 examples of people rejected, most of those people did not make it to our doors for help."
1982.81-857,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1491.285,1497.688,Are you suggesting that the fundamental right to travel on which you rely applies only to indigents?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1497.688,1500.0,"No, it applies to all."
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.178,1521.662,I'm not sure I understand why this is limited to indigents.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1542.637,1544.543,They could also pay tuition.
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.543,1548.4,But supposing it doesn't happen to be a private school in this district.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1559.974,1561.051,Is this a United States citizen child?
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.051,1561.647,Yes.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1571.658,1572.921,"Yes, they do."
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.734,1576.439,So indigency really has nothing to do with the case.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1576.439,1583.762,"--Well, the only reason that indigency comes up is that those parents can do that right now by paying the minimal amount of tuition--"
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.762,1584.901,But they say they don't want.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1588.776,1592.118,"--If they would rather stand on their constitutional right, I suppose they could."
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.118,1593.273,You would represent them?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1593.273,1594.789,"No, they wouldn't be eligible."
1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1594.789,1600.225,"But when you said constitutional right, their constitutional right to travel that I had put to you before?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1600.225,1601.255,That's right.
1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.892,1617.793,"Now, if this Court should decide that an infant child has no constitutional right to travel, does that wash your case out?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1617.793,1626.652,"No, I don't believe so because still, under Doe v. Plyler, this child is being absolutely deprived of an education in a place where he lives."
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.692,1647.222,"But as a constitutional matter, could not this particular... could not Texas require that if any child is to live separate and apart from his parents, he must have a legal guardian appointed?"
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1649.827,1651.032,It would depend on their reason for doing it.
1982.81-857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.156,1658.48,"--The reason that Justice O'Connor referred to, they want to have someone who is legally responsible for decisionmaking on behalf of the child."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1658.48,1660.84,--If that were the reason I should think that would be constitutional.
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.839,1679.128,"Well, it's interesting, though, that you have stipulated in this case that none of these children live with his or her parents or a legal guardian, or a person having lawful control of him or her, on the order of the court."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1679.128,1679.787,By order of the court.
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.787,1687.593,"That none of them has a parent, legal guardian or other person having lawful control of them under an order of court, living within the school district."
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1687.593,1689.75,"That's the statutory language, Your Honor."
1982.81-857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.347,1720.237,Not if... not contrary to the wishes of the parents.
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1720.237,1722.924,"--If it were... that's right, that would be a different case."
1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.049,1731.998,Do you think your statement is consistent with the stipulation of fact that Justice White just read to you?
1982.81-857,0,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,1731.998,1732.921,Absolutely.
1982.81-857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1765.358,1772.763,Mr. Arnett.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,1772.763,1775.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1893.136,1894.291,By case law?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,1894.291,1895.777,By administrative interpretation.
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1905.148,1908.224,Is it a de facto residency?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,1908.224,1910.096,It's not simply de facto.
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.127,1922.434,But can you be a bona fide resident for six months for purposes of getting a free public education?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,1925.405,1928.182,Not if your primary purpose is to obtain an education.
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.947,1985.958,"What if parents decide that they like the public schools in Corpus Christi, Texas and they decide to move from New Mexico to Corpus Christi, Texas so their children can attend the public schools there, and for no other purpose."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,1987.381,1988.691,"Yes, Your Honor, that is all right."
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.691,1989.97,Because they're with their parents.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,1989.97,2000.654,"Yes, Your Honor, because when their parents move into that district as a family unit on another situation where a child resides with the guardian... and the reason we have a guardianship provision is some children need to have guardians."
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2022.192,2024.411,"Under my assumption, that is their only reason."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2024.411,2024.91,--Okay.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.844,2035.313,"They're going to pay the taxes, too."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2035.313,2039.233,"They're going to pay taxes there, their work is going to support the local economy there."
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.896,2071.517,"What if the family from New Mexico doesn't want to move into Texas, but they want to send their child down there, and they say what's your tuition, and you tell them and they say, we'll pay it."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2071.517,2074.391,That's a local option matter.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.608,2080.122,"Well, do some districts permit that?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2080.122,2082.294,I think probably most districts do it.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.294,2082.856,All right.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2084.198,2084.949,That's right.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.949,2090.522,"And they would be the only people who would be paying a tuition; otherwise, it's free, isn't it?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2090.522,2091.946,Not necessarily.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.723,2099.269,They commute.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2099.269,2100.333,--They commute.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.743,2125.68,You mean if you lose the case.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2125.68,2126.932,"--If we lose the case, that's right."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.024,2131.975,You mean we've got to decide busing again?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2133.429,2139.536,"--No, sir, we don't have to decide whether... the propriety of it, but just where a federal court has ordered it--"
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2139.536,2141.598,Did you ever heard of a red herring?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2141.598,2145.767,"--Well, Your Honor, I have three sisters that have kids in different school districts in Texas."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.89,2153.375,"But busing is not here, is it?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2153.375,2156.28,"--Busing is in many Texas school districts, and--"
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.28,2158.215,Is busing in this case?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2158.215,2162.308,"--Impliedly, it is, Your Honor, because it is an incentive to change school districts."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.308,2163.665,"Impliedly, guns are too, aren't they?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2165.526,2173.458,It certainly will be one of the common reasons that would be utilized and would motivate people to change school districts on the part of their children.
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.193,2179.676,Did this child change because of busing?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2185.203,2192.53,"You'll find nothing in the record to support many of the statements that have been made up here, and there's certainly nothing in the record to answer your question with."
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.099,2233.015,"Well, I suppose Texas could adopt a residency requirement for public school purposes that would require residency in the normal sense of going with an intent to remain indefinitely."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2235.624,2237.153,--It would be possible.
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2244.79,2246.756,Isn't that what most states do?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2246.756,2248.663,"No, Your Honor, it's not what most states do."
1982.81-857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.234,2269.467,Let me just ask you one more question in response to your response to Justice O'Connor.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2293.285,2294.002,--That's right.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.78,2422.967,"Is the amount of the tuition in the record, that you would have to pay if--"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2422.967,2425.872,"This child is paying tuition, by the way."
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.928,2435.273,--So what is the tuition?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2435.273,2437.882,The bond they posted was $1244.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.44,2454.015,So this rule really does have an incidence on people who can't pay the tuition.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2454.015,2457.123,--If the district... but that's not the statute.
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.123,2460.889,You can move into the district for an education anytime you want to pay for it.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2460.889,2474.724,"Let me differentiate between the district's policy of accepting children with a tuition, and the state statute which denies state funding and also, does not require the districts to accept children under these circumstances."
1982.81-857,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.707,2483.05,I know.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2493.392,2495.279,"That is undoubtedly correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.721,2598.814,May I interrupt you for kind of a general question?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2614.702,2622.15,--I think it would be fair to say that every child in McAllen could have a guardian appointed for him with the amount of money Legal Aid spent bringing this case up to the Supreme Court.
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.15,2623.211,"Well, yes, but this is not a typical--"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2623.211,2623.698,It is not exorbitant.
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.648,2632.991,--But is there a procedure for having a guardian appointed for an indigent?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2632.991,2640.391,"Well, once again, our statutes require that an application for guardianship show the necessity for the appointment of a guardian."
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.391,2647.219,Supposing in this very case the sister came in and said she wanted to be appointed the guardian so the child could go to school.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2647.219,2653.155,"Well, according to the plaintiffs, in one case out of Brownsville, it was refused on that basis."
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.509,2671.1,So we should take this case on the assumption that this child could not have obtained a guardianship.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2674.504,2675.675,"--No, couldn't do that because--"
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.675,2685.092,We must take the case on the assumption that there are a significant number of children who could not get guardianships in Texas but who want to live with their sisters or some similar custodian.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2685.092,2686.827,--For the purpose of going to school?
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.237,2723.093,Does the custodian have the same decisionmaking authority as a guardian would?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2723.093,2725.467,"No, Your Honor, he doesn't."
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.093,2779.869,"It would seem to me you might have a problem if an American citizen says I want to live in this county for whatever reason, I have a right to do that, and I would like to have a guardian appointed who can make decisions for me because I'm only 12 years old or 11 years old."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2786.241,2790.878,"Now, I think if he needs a guardian appointed for him to exercise his rights--"
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.878,2792.27,Just because he's 12 years old and that's where he wants to live.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2792.27,2793.58,--And to exercise his rights.
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.838,2821.006,"Even though the only reason he's there is he hopes after this guardianship has been appointed, he'd like to go to school there."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2821.006,2824.928,"If they're as clever as you are, they're going to beat the system."
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.63,2827.194,It doesn't take... you're not very clever to figure that one out.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2827.194,2841.169,"Well, I just point out that if the guardian... if the probate court was satisfied that the only purpose for the appointment of a guardian was to establish school residency, I can't promise this Court that a guardianship would be granted."
1982.81-857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.585,2874.768,"I must confess I have a lot of difficulty understanding a facial attack on a statute brought by a litigant, and we don't care how the statute applies to the particular litigant."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2882.761,2914.953,"--Well, in terms of the way the statute applies to this particular litigant even, their argument could only be that the state has a constitutional duty to discriminate in his favor, because it seems to me beyond doubt that Texas can avoid the problems, both short term and long term, in terms of their effect on school districts and their control, from students hopping around different parts of the state, from students going from Dallas out to the suburbs, from students going from Houston to Austin even."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.274,2940.505,"In Texas, do you have any problems from students from any other state other than the government of Mexico?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2941.882,2944.051,"No, there's nothing in the record."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2944.051,2944.924,Isn't that your only problem?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2946.971,2951.561,"Well, we talked... that's the only place where we've got illegal aliens from, Your Honor."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2961.746,2963.54,How many would that encompass?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2963.54,2967.805,--That was a particular child care institution there.
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.805,2971.553,"That's A-1, where you have hundreds and thousands of Mexicans, right?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2971.553,2978.939,"Well, the testimony of the superintendents in this case was that there will be thousands come in from interstate or international."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.391,2988.076,"And there's nothing in the record on hopping, either, is there?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2988.076,2990.872,There's certainly plenty in the case law on that.
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2990.872,2993.247,But there's nothing in this case.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2993.247,2995.56,"No, Your Honor, but I would indicate that--"
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.56,2998.075,And this petitioner didn't hop to but one place.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,2999.494,3004.852,"--Well, I imagine the other ones would only make one hop, too."
1982.81-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3004.852,3018.441,"Mr. Arnett, you and Justice Marshall were talking about moving from Mexico to Texas or from state to state, but this statute applies to moving from district to district, does it not?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3018.441,3019.548,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3038.949,3044.241,Do states in remote areas so far as Mexico is concerned have similar laws?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3046.663,3050.254,"Well, for example, New Hampshire has the same law."
1982.81-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3053.771,3054.785,They have the same law for what purpose?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3055.97,3057.096,Obviously not.
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.514,3067.264,Do you deny that this one was to keep Mexicans out?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3067.264,3068.999,"--Yes, Your Honor, I deny that."
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3068.999,3070.933,Give me what proof you have.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3070.933,3074.263,Because it's been a doctrine in Texas law since 1903.
1982.81-857,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3074.263,3076.509,And there were no Mexicans in 1903?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3077.293,3087.553,"And the case came up in 1905... this was at a time that, you have to remember, that the state also educated any Mexicans that came in and it had no rules against educating illegal aliens."
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3104.609,3109.998,I thought we had a district court finding in this case on the purpose.
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3109.998,3115.699,You have a district court finding that one purpose of the statute was to impede people coming in from Mexico to go to school.
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3115.699,3117.337,Don't we have to accept that?
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3117.337,3125.335,"Well, I think you can look at the factual underpinnings of it because the district court fell victim to what this Court rejected in O'Brien, United States versus O'Brien."
1982.81-857,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3143.576,3146.326,"But in the posture that this case is here, don't we have to accept that finding?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3146.326,3148.357,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe you do."
1982.81-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3180.122,3199.32,"The district court also mentioned, as I recall, counsel, the state's interest in the tax burden, so that children couldn't choose districts without having parents or guardians who contributed to that... who helped relieve the tax burden."
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3201.196,3210.441,"The district court has a finding that children like this do not generally pay taxes, and the cost of their education will have to be borne by the bona fide residents of that district."
1982.81-857,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3210.441,3219.546,"And the district court also mentioned the importance of school boards being able to plan from year to year as to pupil-teacher ratio, load, et cetera, didn't it?"
1982.81-857,1,38549,richard_l_arnett,,3219.546,3225.072,"He talked about overcrowding, he talked about the inter-district transfers and how they would disrupt the educational system."
1982.81-857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3417.96,3425.736,"You have two minutes remaining, Mr. Tuddenham."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3425.736,3426.754,Thank you.
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3452.667,3455.288,"Let me just ask one other question about that, if I may."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3464.236,3468.954,--The plaintiff before the Court is a child from Mexico; he is the... this is not a class action.
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3469.5,3478.013,"No, but the issue... if we're not concerned with the impact on the particular litigant, is the constitutional issue is the same as the hypothetical case I posed?"
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3478.013,3481.715,--I do not believe so.
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.509,3493.101,I don't understand that.
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3495.709,3498.52,"Well, that was the way it was litigated in the district court--"
1982.81-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3498.52,3506.581,"We could give you all the relief you wanted by just saying that insofar as this statute impacts on... has an impact on your client, it's unconstitutional."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3508.827,3516.715,"Insofar as it prevents children who have no other choice and who need an education, this is their only choice for an education in the United States--"
1982.81-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.715,3517.09,But this record--
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3528.134,3532.193,"--The record shows that he is indigent, and a guardian--"
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3532.193,3538.144,"Well, the record doesn't show that he ever applied for a guardianship, or had his sister apply for a guardianship and was turned down."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3538.144,3541.548,--His parents were afraid of giving up permanent custody of their children.
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.548,3545.33,"Well, the record doesn't show that she couldn't have tried that route, does it?"
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3545.33,3550.938,But she is indigent and it requires a bond of up to $1000 to be posted.
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3550.938,3553.215,"Well, they apparently posted a bond to go to school, according to your opponent."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3553.215,3554.357,The bond was--
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.357,3558.837,"We don't know the facts as to the particular litigant, is what I am saying."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3558.837,3559.43,--Excuse me?
1982.81-857,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3559.43,3569.398,We don't know the impossibility of this litigant attending this school by some other means because you haven't tried out all the aspects of the impact of the statute on this litigant.
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3569.398,3586.123,"But it is clear that this statute is and was designed to create an expanding class of American citizens, whose parents are in Mexico who have no other place they can go to school, but who have a right even now as citizens to live in the United States."
1982.81-857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.124,3589.313,"Well, they can go to school in Mexico."
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3593.543,3606.805,"If I may respond to that, Justice White, just last year Mr. Arnett, in Plyler versus Doe, told this Court that there are over four and a half million children of school age in Mexico who are not attending school because of inadequate facilities in Mexico."
1982.81-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3610.148,3612.663,Does that mean that Texas should support them?
1982.81-857,2,23297,edward_j_tuddenham,,3612.663,3617.065,"--Not the children of Mexico, but this child as a United States citizen."
1982.81-857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3628.325,3629.935,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
