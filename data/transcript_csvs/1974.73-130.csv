1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.993,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-130, Ellis against Dyson."
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,35.527,38.381,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,121.901,127.425,"And the purpose of that application was to prevent there being tried at all or through it, was that it or --?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,127.425,131.992,The purpose was to provide that the Texas courts with an opportunity to pass on the constitutional question.
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.992,133.032,"Yes, this is pretrial?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,133.032,134.064,"Pretrial, yes sir."
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.064,138.884,And then what they asked for was that they not be tried at all because the statute or the ordinance was unconstitutional?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,138.884,140.922,"Was facially unconstitutional, yes sir."
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,140.922,144.456,"Incidentally, what was the form of the charge?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,144.456,150.269,The form -- the charge I believe was an information for loitering under the Dallas ordinance.
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,164.711,169.007,"Mr. Neuborne, are the petitioners here still living in Dallas?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,169.007,175.861,"Your Honor, we have been unable to ascertain at the present time the whereabouts of the petitioners."
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,230.01,236.736,"But if they are not living there, the case certainly is moot as to any possible future arrests?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,236.736,238.233,I would think that is correct sir.
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,280.577,288.827,"From what you say, would it be entirely unreasonable to suggest that you are lawyers without clients at the moment?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,288.827,289.805,I think not sir.
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,291.022,291.974,You don't know where they are?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,291.974,298.049,You don't know where they live in Dallas and you don't know whether they're disposed as to perhaps this litigation?
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,494.067,499.346,Why it's complied by the judgment of a Municipal Court?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,499.346,501.973,"Yes sir, I was coming."
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,528.23,533.002,But why not when the -- you only did that after the motion to dismiss?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,533.002,535.022,"Yes that was a pretrial motion to dismiss, Your honor but --"
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.022,538.742,And there was quite a general ruling on that?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,538.742,541.304,There was a ruling on the motion to dismiss.
1974.73-130,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.304,542.482,By Texas Court?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,542.482,543.388,"Yes, sir but --"
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.532,545.087,So why does it have to be --
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,545.087,557.206,"Well, Your Honor, we suggested that the final judgment would not have attached until the Texas Court reached the full merits of the determination on the -- as to guilt or innocence."
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.915,574.131,"Mr. Neuborne, would you know whether under these circumstances the Texas Court would know the bars of this judgment in filing a civil suit a (Inaudible) suit in the Texas Court?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,574.131,584.604,My understanding sir is that the entry of the nolo contendere plea under Texas law and I am not an expert on Texas law but my understanding of Texas law is that we would have not been barred.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.614,600.743,I know by nolo contendere but barred by the courts decision on your motion dismiss in which you presented the constitutional issue and its final result.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,600.743,619.695,Yes sir and the whole purpose of presenting that constitutional issue to Texas Court was to provide them with the option if they wish to reach the issues and if they chose not to reach the issues to at least permit the petitioners to reserve their federal rights for litigation at some future points.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.289,636.437,Why not Mr. Neuborne?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,636.437,643.691,We think that there are five probable -- possible reasons why res judicata should not apply.
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.359,739.11,"Do you have any word about nolo contendere in Texas, if you plead nolo contendere you're then found guilty, are you not?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,739.11,740.01,"Yes sir, you are --"
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.01,742.439,"And you then can be sent to prison, right?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,742.439,743.189,"Yes sir, the --"
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,743.189,744.874,But you say it doesn't have any effect?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,744.874,745.737,"No, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.463,758.305,Is it different from a guilty plea?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,758.305,759.911,"Yes sir, very different from the guilty plea."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,759.911,761.076,In that case?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,761.076,761.501,A guilty plea --
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.501,762.744,You mean at Texas case?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,762.744,767.293,"Well, for -- Your Honor, I think Texas follows the traditional rule that would be followed in the federal court."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,768.228,769.24,Do you think?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,769.24,769.93,If there's an antitrust prosec --
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.93,771.87,Do you think?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,771.87,772.905,That's my understanding of the Texas law.
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.905,775.334,"Well, it's showing you one there who lived --"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,775.334,782.334,"Well, Your Honor if I could read you that Texas statute which my colleague has pointed out to you."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,782.334,783.501,That's all I ask you.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,783.501,785.486,I'm sorry I should have gotten to it much sooner.
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.954,831.843,Well that's quite different all than saying that it doesn't have any collateral effect in the traditional sense because you take the federal antitrust judgments and certainly the Texas statute sounds like it's a counter part of them permit the use of a criminal judgment and to rather unusual way in a civil action.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,839.352,847.493,"But Your Honor as I understood, I understood that and I think Your Honor's suggestion that the Texas practice is the same as the federal antitrust practice is correct."
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.419,872.638,That certainly makes sense but it seems to me that falls far short of saying that he is not bound by the judgment entered in this case.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,872.638,874.539,We want all -- all petitioners.
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.978,889.336,"But you're asking that they expunge, aren't you?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,889.336,906.984,"Well, Your Honor petitioners seek three causes of action and because the case below which disposed of under Becker versus Thompson, no Court below found it necessary to analyze the three causes of action separately but I suggest that the separate analysis of the cause of action is critical you make it in a proper resolution."
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.275,943.085,"Well, what's the federal basis for that second cause of action?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,943.085,951.862,That as far as I know is a normal cause of action and one which the District Court never reached Your Honor because it felt that it could not even entertain the first cause of action.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.641,962.74,But your cause of action again has a plea?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,962.74,963.7,"No, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.508,976.414,I thought you said that -- and it's not (Inaudible).
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,976.414,976.96,"No, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.96,979.0,What's the law to suggest these?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,979.0,979.853,No.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.484,998.799,"But also suppose he appealed that you have trial de novo, you have judgment to contest, but in any way he was not found guilty?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1008.145,1009.879,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.879,1012.596,Couldn't suppose directing it in three causes is open to them.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1012.596,1012.99,"No, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.898,1015.056,"Well, why wouldn't you?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1015.056,1016.112,We don't suggest Your Honor.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.112,1017.66,But why wouldn't you?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1017.66,1020.835,Because of the absence of a two-tier problem in a direct appeal situation.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.835,1025.855,"Well, but rather that's affirm, but firmly what was barred was it res judicata or what?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1025.855,1026.338,Oh!
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.992,1030.667,What about Younger versus Harris?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1030.667,1035.525,"Well, it's not res judicata Younger versus Harris, the notion that the criminal preceding continues on to the very end."
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.525,1039.79,"Under that party, let's assume that in trying you got to assume."
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1053.839,1058.069,"Your Honor, I would suggest that then the issue would turn on what the cause of action was."
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1064.335,1067.218,So either res judicata would enough to be barred?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1067.218,1084.512,In no circumstances but I think the critical distinction and the distinction which I'm trying to articulate is the difference between the cause of action which is retrospective in nature and looks backward to attempt to impeach the judgment itself and a judgment which is declaratory and prospective in nature under the Steffel rule and which --
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.512,1088.387,That is very dysfunction argument in sometime?
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.387,1092.336,"Well it falls, it falls between two tools, I'm afraid I have not in my own mind Your Honor."
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1092.336,1096.478,"Well, given that the records you have (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.478,1111.835,"No, sir. I think it might be possible although it might be possible to postulate an argument that said that the conviction when made was proper and it having pleaded nolo, one cannot then you go back and attempt to directly impeach the conviction."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1137.551,1150.5,"Well, what good will it do this petitions, assuming that if you win this case and assume it doesn't get on the front page of every newspaper in this country how will they able to know about it?"
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1150.5,1155.392,"But Your Honor, we will -- first their arrest and conviction records will be expunged and in terms --"
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1155.392,1156.418,"Well, how will they know about it?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1156.418,1164.204,"Well, but in terms of the ordinary and normal dissemination of the arrest and conviction records, which go on in everyday life at least, that will stop for the petitioners."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.204,1165.634,But how they will know about it?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1165.634,1169.358,"Your Honor, we will make every effort to notify them personally."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1169.857,1172.332,And if they're alive you might find them.
1974.73-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.332,1172.835,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1181.696,1185.004,When did you all last hear from the petitioners?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1185.004,1187.332,"Your Honor, as I understand it approximately a year ago."
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1187.332,1193.05,Did you ask counsel hear from them or was there some indirect communication?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1193.05,1196.147,"Your honor, I'm counsel in New York."
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1199.203,1201.406,Have you ever heard from them?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1201.406,1202.597,If I have personally heard from them?
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1202.597,1202.958,Yes.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1202.958,1204.702,"No sir, I came into this case."
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1204.702,1206.884,Has any counsel in this room ever heard from them?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1206.884,1207.612,"Oh, yes, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1207.612,1208.649,Which one?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1208.649,1210.521,"Oh, did you just say in this room, Mr. Powell?"
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1210.521,1213.824,Yes.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1213.824,1217.267,"Your Honor, counsel who has dealt personally with them is Professor Walter Steele."
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1217.267,1218.153,Is he present?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1218.153,1219.531,At the Southern Methodist University.
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1220.648,1228.154,Do you know when he last heard from them?
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1228.154,1230.766,Approximately one year ago Mr. Kennedy told.
1974.73-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1230.766,1245.213,Was that in writing or how was the communication conveyed?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1245.213,1257.229,Professor Kennedy tells me the original authorization was in writing but he doesn't know whether the last contact a year ago was in writing or not.
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1257.229,1262.743,Can you tell this Court what they want right now?
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1264.755,1266.294,How can you do it?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1270.059,1271.374,"What they want right now, Your Honor --"
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1271.374,1272.791,How could you say it?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1272.791,1278.029,"Well based on the authorization which they gave to counsel, when the case was originally begun."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1278.029,1279.562,But people change somehow?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1279.562,1280.119,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.085,1287.376,But how do we know we've got a case or controversy here?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1287.376,1288.474,I don't know that you have.
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1288.474,1290.232,"Oh, you don't?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1290.232,1310.53,We suggested to the Court and I think appropriately so that the problem -- a problem with this case is that it would be appropriate to go forward with the prospective causes of action under fed -- under generalized notions of federalism but there was at the time it was presented to the District Court in 1972 a live case or controversy.
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.671,1353.316,But don't we need a case or controversy to do that?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1353.316,1368.687,My understanding is that you can if you wish vacate a decision of the Court below on the grounds that it either has become moot or that the case or controversy no longer exist and remand to that court below for the taking of evidence.
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1368.687,1371.602,Are you suggesting mootness?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1371.602,1373.834,"I'm suggesting that there is possibility of it, yes."
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.143,1378.134,"What do you want us to do, write an essay?"
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1378.134,1392.99,"Your Honor what if, what we suggest that you do is write a one line vacation of the District Court's dismissal and a remand to the District Court to simply determine whether under the principles that this Court are laid out last year in Steffel versus Thompson, there's --"
1974.73-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1392.99,1396.527,But I thought you said was moot?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1396.527,1401.639,"Well, Your Honor mootness and lack of standing in the case like this seems to come in a full circle."
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.912,1453.735,And what's your answer to Younger?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1453.735,1454.337,I'm sorry sir?
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.337,1457.298,Why doesn't Younger rather than Steffel?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1457.298,1467.178,Younger doesn't apply because the pending prosecution was over a full month before the proceeding began and the pending prosecution was over Your Honor with the consent of the State of Texas.
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1503.518,1509.461,Do you and the State agree that that is the effect of a nolo plea in Texas?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1509.461,1519.059,"I have not discuss the matter with the State but from the statute that was the understanding of counsel when he offered the nolo plea, that is the understanding of counsel today when we present it to the Court."
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1519.059,1524.922,But what -- so what -- it certainly didn't bar you for appealing up through the state system.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1524.922,1526.001,No sir and on that --
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1526.001,1530.848,And or it didn't bar you from raising your federal claims further in the state system?
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1530.848,1535.669,"No sir except under those circumstances had we done so, I fear that we would have been --"
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1535.669,1537.783,I understand that but there was no bar.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1537.783,1552.156,"Oh, no sir, we were -- except for the bar that's raised by the danger of a 20-fold increase in sentence in the two-tier system of justice which Texas maintains which Your Honor can be a substantial impediment to proceedings."
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.58,1562.533,"But they could have re-litigated these issues in the higher court, could they not, the (Voice Overlap)"
1974.73-130,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1562.533,1564.309,No question about it Your Honor.
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1565.655,1584.015,"But returning to the questions of Mr. Justice Marshall a few minutes ago, you got a petition for certiorari filed in this Court nearly a year and a half ago and during that year and a half the period, we don't know whether there's a case or controversy still here."
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1584.015,1584.257,"Your Honor, when --"
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1584.257,1593.328,Yet the whole machinery of the course has been involved in dealing with this case which we're not sure and you can't assure us is a case.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1593.328,1607.927,"Your Honor, when we learned of the problems in locating the plaintiffs, that's when we in our -- for the first time in our brief on the merits suggested to the Court the appropriateness of a remand in this case and not a plenary consideration on the merits."
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.927,1624.625,I suggest to you that it's hardly the time of the case that ought to engaged the attention of this Court with all else it has to do to wait until the case has been here for a year and a half to find out whether there's any case at all and that is calling you personally considering your job as counsel.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1624.625,1626.884,"We -- I take it, I take it."
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1634.328,1635.575,I don't intend it personally.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1646.975,1647.611,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.611,1648.899,So there's no personal criticism.
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1648.899,1652.143,I understand that and I agree with it completely.
1974.73-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.143,1667.744,Well I suppose your suggestions of a Steffel remand with these following the Steffel procedure determining whether there is a live case or controversy represented or recognition on your part and suggested --
1974.73-130,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1667.744,1668.228,"Well, yes sir."
1974.73-130,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1687.205,1689.748,"Very well, Mr. Neuborne."
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1692.994,1696.308,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-130,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.299,1764.307,"What page, do you have the page?"
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1764.307,1773.431,"I don't, it's the arrest report which refers to the petitioner Love."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1848.251,1850.237,What's an alias ticket?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1850.237,1857.53,"Sir, one of the petitioners had a ticket which he did not dispose of."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1867.761,1869.74,Both of them have?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1869.74,1871.21,I believe it was one of them.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1871.21,1885.295,"Both 45 which has to do with Ellis and 46 which has to do with Mr. Love, each one is also arrested for loitering and alias tickets."
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1890.469,1894.51,An alias ticket is one that hasn't been disposed of by payment of a fine.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1894.51,1895.336,About what?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1895.336,1896.559,By payment of a fine.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.559,1900.029,What kind of -- is one what that hasn't been disposed of?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,1900.029,1914.948,It's a ticket or citation that usually a Minor Misdemeanor Traffic Citation type matter which they either took a plea of guilty or they just never did come in to Municipal Court and dispose of.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2071.252,2072.007,(Voice Overlap) the Act?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2084.147,2084.538,Yes.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.014,2087.031,About how much time did they have to do that?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2087.031,2089.311,"I believe, Your Honor, it's 10 days."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.311,2090.686,From February 22?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2090.686,2091.809,Correct.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2091.809,2096.616,And they filed this complaint in federal court on March 27 that's after the 10th day.
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2096.616,2097.534,That's correct.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.534,2100.429,"When you say you believe 10 days, is it or isn't it 10 days?"
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2100.429,2106.194,"In my best knowledge, I'm almost positive yes, its 10 days."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2106.194,2112.019,So they actually -- they let the time for that appeal run out before they brought this federal court action?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2112.019,2113.932,"I'm sure of that, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.932,2121.056,Mr. Conner is the ordinance still in effect in it's the same form or has it been amended?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2121.056,2135.447,"Sir, it -- for purposes of this case, yes it is in effect to the extent of number of arrests, I do not know but it still is being use and enforce."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2135.447,2140.403,Has its constitutionality been tested in the state courts anywhere to your knowledge?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2140.403,2149.99,"No, it has not."
1974.73-130,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2206.231,2208.326,Mr. Conner I have one other question.
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2227.166,2230.112,Well we did and in this case --
1974.73-130,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2230.112,2233.655,I think they didn't go for each other.
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2233.655,2235.314,They did plead out.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2449.548,2463.769,The fact remains Mr. Conner does it not that the District Court here dismissed this complaint on the authority of Becker against Thompson?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2463.769,2464.213,That's correct.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2464.213,2473.368,And Becker against Thompson was explicitly overruled by this Court and Steffel against Thompson.
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2485.466,2496.066,"Your Honor I think, it was decided under Younger Doctrine primarily and the interpretation of the Fifth Circuit of Younger."
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.685,2535.799,"In other words, you're saying that in order to remand we have to find the case or controversy here and now."
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2535.799,2541.281,Yes and not at the time the action was initiated by the time of review.
1974.73-130,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2541.281,2549.349,But isn't your position also from your remarks that there was not a sufficiet case or controversy at the time the District Court decided this?
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2549.349,2553.527,That's exactly my position.
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.527,2560.555,That even again under Steffel against Thompson?
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2562.206,2568.612,A case or controversy or a genuine threat or future prosecutions sufficient to involve the intervention of [Voice overlap].
1974.73-130,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2568.612,2569.387,That's right.
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2573.406,2589.752,"Correct, and I think the Court should look in the pattern of practices of the respondents or the government officials involved and see whether or not there is a genuine threat and there are no allegations in the complaint and no allegations today or anytime."
1974.73-130,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.752,2606.203,"But I think it's your one of your positions is that only aside from Steffel, Younger against Harris as far as this 1980 that this sued in the state court or in a federal court because they failed to follow their case up to the state system."
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2621.741,2631.291,I would believe and I do urge that Younger v. Harris should be applicable or at least considered in this Court ruling.
1974.73-130,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2640.18,2641.77,But there was.
1974.73-130,1,20642,douglas_h_conner,,2647.051,2657.198,Right but the petitioners by their own actions took the less stringent course and say they're not bound by Younger because we pay the fine.
1974.73-130,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.21,2749.859,You have a few minutes left Mr. Neuborne.
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2749.859,2751.699,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-130,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.115,2988.268,"Well, I gather you are the only one that you are under no obligation under something said in Monroe and Pape and Preiser and Rodriguez."
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2988.268,2988.872,"Oh, of course."
1974.73-130,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.872,2990.102,To exhaust any traditional relief.
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,2990.102,2990.47,Of course.
1974.73-130,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3005.202,3012.132,"Well I gather that, I gather that certainly been settled as to administrative state of administered remedies but what about the --"
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3012.132,3013.995,"I think state judicial remedies too, Your Honor."
1974.73-130,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.415,3016.355,"Well, that suggested Monroe and Paper, I gather that."
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3016.355,3018.544,"Well, in Preiser versus Rodriguez."
1974.73-130,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.544,3024.001,"Also, the language in Preiser is only for remedy under the Civil Rights Act is available."
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3035.603,3037.268,I think that's right.
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3037.508,3039.521,It's up to the extent Younger might make?
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3039.521,3046.121,"Yes, sir and the reason that Younger we think does not apply here Your Honor was the nolo contendere aspect of this case."
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3050.671,3054.403,Then we have a different story of the (Inaudible) as far as Government.
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3054.403,3059.828,"It would be a different issue, yes sir it would be a great deal more difficult."
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.828,3063.883,Or it might be different from --
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3063.883,3070.262,Your Honor under those circumstances I want to know whether it was a two-tier system of justice so that the appeal might have been impeded.
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3071.774,3082.687,But I think a while ago in your brief that if you have had trial de novo is that your constitutional claim that's been rejected and been convicted in and then tell to appeal.
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3082.687,3084.278,We could not abuse 1983.
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3084.278,3085.219,Because Younger?
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3085.219,3088.031,"Yes sir but Your Honor, but Your Honor -- but the appeal from the trial --"
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3088.031,3088.995,You have touched that.
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3088.995,3090.724,I'm sorry sir.
1974.73-130,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3090.724,3097.576,Well I don't understand if you can see that why then you are not in the same position not having taken a de novo with you.
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3097.576,3102.743,"Your Honor, in the novo appeal the potential sentence, the potential maximum was 20 times greater."
1974.73-130,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3102.743,3104.522,Why is Younger?
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3117.069,3132.217,The difference Your Honor is that a trial de novo to sentence that one receives of the trial de novo cannot be changed on appeal except in accordance with restrictions of Pierce versus North Carolina so that there is no threat of a greater sanction cause by going up through the appellate process.
1974.73-130,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.258,3154.966,"Well if you can, if nolo contendere will helps you out why can you bring in 1983 Action before the original trial court?"
1974.73-130,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3154.966,3157.789,"Your Honor, I think that under Younger principles --"
