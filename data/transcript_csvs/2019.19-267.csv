2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,14.48,"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-267, Our Lady of Guadalupe School versus Agnes Morrissey-Berru, and the consolidated case. Mr. Rassbach."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,14.48,50.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If separation of church and state means anything at all, it must mean the government cannot interfere with the church's decisions about who is authorized to teach its religion. In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches the faith to schoolchildren. Under Hosanna-Tabor, the answer is easy."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,128.48,140.92,"Counsel, you say in your brief that personnel is policy and that teachers, as part of their job, personify church values."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,145.72,154.28,"I -- I think, in -- in this case, I don't think that's something you have to address, and I don't think that it would -- personification --"
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,154.28,159.52,"Well, I don't -- I don't have to address it, but you do because I asked. (Laughter.)"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,159.52,160.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,186.56,206.48,"Does your argument, both with respect to personifying values as a factor and with the other functions that the teachers might perform, apply in the case of teachers who are not Catholic because many Catholic schools hire teachers who -- who aren't?"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,206.48,211.2,So -- so I -- I don't think it -- it does.
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.64,243.4,Justice Thomas?
2019.19-267,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,243.4,257.64,"Yes, counsel, how would you -- how exactly would you go about, or a secular court go about, determining whether an employee's duties and functions are religious or whether they're important?"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,257.64,323.0,"Well, I -- I think -- I think the -- the best way to think about it is, with respect to the religious part of it, I think you -- you have to -- you can look at the -- the list of things that this Court talked about in Hosanna-Tabor, so teaching, preaching, as well as the -- the list that was in the concurrence by Justice Alito, and look at those as a kind of safe harbor in terms of, if one of those things is present, then -- then it clearly is an important religious function. But then, if you -- if you -- let's say you have something where the church is -- or the religious defendant is raising some other thing as an important religious function, then I think you probably -- you -- you would -- you would have to look -- do some deference to the church's understanding of that. So -- and -- and this is pointed out actually in the brief by Professor McConnell where he talks about substantial deference on both the importance question and the religious question."
2019.19-267,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,323.0,327.52,Thank you.
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,327.52,328.2,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-267,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.2,335.08,I would appreciate your answers to two questions.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,372.12,388.64,"So, to answer both of your questions, Your Honor, with respect to who is not covered, I -- I think it would include anyone who's not performing important religious functions, so, for example, the janitor."
2019.19-267,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.04,427.32,"Yes, whether coaches, the athletic coaches, they would be ministers too?"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,427.32,432.84,"I don't -- I don't think a coach -- did you say coach, Your Honor?"
2019.19-267,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,432.84,433.64,Uh-huh.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,433.64,436.36,"Yes, I don't think a coach would necessarily be one."
2019.19-267,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.16,454.6,Suppose they lead the -- the team in an opening prayer.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,454.6,473.6,"I think that if they do an opening prayer, you know, forget what I -- you know, I think that there would be -- just saying that, just doing that would probably come within something like the Sukkah situation with the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation case where it's essentially de minimis."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,489.36,492.44,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,492.44,493.64,-- in that event.
2019.19-267,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,493.64,512.64,"I think that the statute itself provides for a religious exemption for hiring the person of a particular religion where that's connected with the carrying on of the religious organization's activities. There is also the BFOQ, the Bona Fide Occupational Qualification."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,553.32,556.76,"Well, I think it's -- I think it's because of the Establishment Clause, Your Honor."
2019.19-267,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.36,600.24,"On the basis -- I don't want to interrupt, but on the basis of what you say so far, I take it to my question, which is what do the religious organizations need other than the exception in the statute, the BFOQ, and the ministerial exemption as confined to leadership, and your answer seems to be they don't."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,600.24,600.96,"No, no, they --"
2019.19-267,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,600.96,602.88,"Rather, there's a --"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,602.88,606.12,"-- they absolutely -- they absolutely do, Justice Breyer."
2019.19-267,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,606.88,607.12,How?
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,607.12,628.0,"-- and -- and -- because -- because, to have control over what they are doing and to be able to control the performance of this important religious function, conveying the faith to younger kids, that -- that is a -- that is a free exercise right that they absolutely have and should have. And I don't think that the BFOQ exception or Title VII or any of the other --"
2019.19-267,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.0,629.64,Religious exemptions --
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,629.64,633.04,-- statutes can overrule that.
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,633.04,633.76,Justice Alito?
2019.19-267,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,633.76,637.24,"Oh, let me follow up on that question."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,669.56,673.48,"I -- I -- I think that -- I think that you're right, Justice Alito, in -- in this sense."
2019.19-267,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,711.44,734.36,"Well, I took Justice Breyer's question to mean why isn't the exemption in Title VII that allows religion to be a qualification for certain jobs sufficient to address the question of a teacher who teaches religion in a religiously affiliated school?"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,734.36,734.84,Right.
2019.19-267,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,763.2,767.0,Thank you.
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,767.0,770.2,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-267,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,770.2,832.8,"Counsel, there's a difference between a teacher who teaches a religion class in a secular school and a teacher who teaches religion in a religious school, but I'm not sure what the difference is, meaning, can you point me to anything in the evidence that the teacher here was acting any differently working from a workbook for her religious class than a teacher does in a secular school? That's my first question. My second question is, I think what's being confused here is that you're asking for an exception to law that's broader than the ministerial exception generally and broader than is necessary to protect the church. The two teachers at issue here are not claiming that they were fired because the school thought they were teaching religion wrong."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,896.76,898.44,So --
2019.19-267,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,898.44,910.04,I don't understand what leadership role or proselytizing role these teachers played in simply teaching about religion.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,910.04,916.2,"So -- so, Your Honor, they -- they absolutely were doing much more than teaching about religion."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.84,961.96,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,961.96,975.2,"Mr. Rassbach, I have a too-long list of hypotheticals, so I'm hoping that you can answer them in just a few words, like basically, yes, he qualifies, no, he doesn't qualify. So here's the first one."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,985.68,986.44,And if he's teaching it devotionally?
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,986.44,990.68,Let's just say this is all -- that's all you know about him.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,990.68,992.32,That's all I know about him.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,994.96,997.04,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,997.04,998.04,-- because it would be de minimis.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,998.04,1012.64,"A math teacher who comes in and you -- you mentioned the Shema at the beginning of your remarks, a very important pair, takes about 20 seconds to say, a math teacher who was told to begin every class with a -- leading the Shema."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1012.64,1020.96,"I -- I -- I don't -- I don't think that that is likely to fall within it because I think it would, again, be de minimis under the --"
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1020.96,1022.36,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1027.84,1031.48,"If it's that alone, probably not."
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1032.64,1033.08,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1033.08,1034.48,-- cashes out in actual practice.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1034.48,1035.12,"Yeah, okay."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1038.52,1039.12,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1039.12,1047.32,A nurse at a Catholic hospital who prays with sick patients and is told otherwise to tend to their religious needs.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1047.32,1052.16,I -- I think a nurse doing that kind of counseling and prayer may well fall within the exception.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1052.16,1054.12,May well fall within it? Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1054.12,1054.48,Yes.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1054.48,1061.68,A press or a communications staffer who prepares press releases for a religious institution of all kinds that they need?
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1061.68,1068.72,That -- that should fall within it because of communication under the Alicea-Hernandez case from the Seventh Circuit.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1068.72,1069.56,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1076.72,1084.72,"That -- that would be a -- probably, but it depends on how much connecting there is."
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1084.72,1085.4,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1090.52,1099.32,My guess is that that would be de minimis under the same kind of rubric as the Davis case that I mentioned earlier.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1099.32,1100.76,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1105.48,1114.04,I think that that usually would fall within it because that's an important religious function and that's the main job.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1114.04,1114.8,Okay.
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1120.96,1123.04,No.
2019.19-267,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1123.04,1125.2,"No, okay."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1132.12,1147.32,"Well, I -- again, I think it's -- I think we laid it out in our -- in our briefing, and that is, what is -- what is it that this person is doing, performing on behalf of the religious body? So what is the -- what is the function that they're performing on behalf of that body? It's not all religious exercise."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1172.6,1174.76,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-267,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1174.76,1181.72,"Counsel, I'd like to follow up on -- on Justice Kagan's line of questioning."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1257.2,1288.92,"Well, I mean, I think this is part of -- part of the issue with -- with the use of the word ""minister."" This is a kind of immunity that really goes to the kind -- kinds of things that are done, that are the kinds of things you would never contemplate having a governmental entity do. And so, therefore, you know, it's true that they may well be within their faith tradition a minister, but the term ""minister,"" as was, you know, explained in -- in the colloquy -- one of the colloquies that Justice Scalia had in Hosanna-Tabor, is that it -- that it's -- it's a legal term here."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.32,1318.2,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-267,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1318.2,1324.36,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Rassbach."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1340.36,1356.6,"Yes, so I -- I think if -- if they're -- if -- if a -- if a teacher is teaching religion devotionally, doctrine, values, what -- what have you, or just religious practices, then that teacher's going to come within the exception. And one way to think about it is this is an Establishment Clause-rooted doctrine."
2019.19-267,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1376.04,1416.2,"Well, I think a number of the questions so far have gone to the limits -- as it often happens, the limits if you were to win this case, and so we're thinking about where it would go. And so say the English teacher who sprinkles in references to Matthew 25 and feed the hungry or the art teacher who talks -- talks about art in the Vatican or the football coach who says the Memorare before every practice and game, the basketball coach who says Our Lady of Victory, pray for us, those kinds of things are definitely instilling religious values. Are those people therefore covered or not covered?"
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1416.2,1437.96,"I -- I -- I think that -- that in -- in most cases, it's the -- they -- they probably would -- if it's only that, if it's just doing the one thing, the sort of saying grace before meal situation, that -- that could be -- that that probably would fall outside the exception because it's not the -- it's not at the -- the heart of what they're doing."
2019.19-267,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1445.44,1467.0,"I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure about that factually, and I guess the question that Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch asked is, are we going to have litigation over what particular students take out of particular coaches or particular teachers? I'm not sure how we do that if you were to win this case and then we go on to the next case."
2019.19-267,0,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,1467.0,1473.28,"I -- I think that the -- I think that your limiting principle is looking at, you know, what was laid out in Hosanna-Tabor."
2019.19-267,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.44,1516.48,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ratner? Ms. Ratner?"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1516.48,1523.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three proposed approaches to the ministerial exception on the table."
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.04,1606.32,"Counsel, Hosanna-Tabor looked at all of the factors in the case, and the issue now seems to be what emphasis you should put on one of those factors, religious function, and what emphasis on a different one, the ministerial title. I guess, in addressing that question, I'd like to repeat Justice Gorsuch's question to you as a representative of the government."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1616.48,1624.56,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the first part of your question, we do think the Court left open in Hosanna-Tabor what is the appropriate methodology here."
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.52,1692.88,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-267,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1692.88,1692.88,Yes.
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1736.32,1736.92,"Sure, Justice Thomas."
2019.19-267,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1797.6,1801.36,Thank you.
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1801.36,1802.16,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.16,1833.96,"The breadth of the exemption is staggering; that is, these people are exempt from all anti-discrimination laws. So, to take a stark example, suppose a teacher who does everything the two teachers in -- in these cases do, as a faith leader, also reports a student's complaint of sexual harassment by a priest and is terminated."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1837.0,1884.0,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that question goes to the ""what is covered by the ministerial exception"" as opposed to the ""who falls within it."" And on the ""what is covered,"" we're simply asking for the same thing that this Court decided in Hosanna-Tabor. And the Court there specifically didn't decide whether things like retaliation for sexual abuse reporting would be covered. What it did decide was that employment discrimination claims that involve the hiring or firing of an employee necessarily go to a religious organization's ability to control who ministers to the faithful and that those claims are categorically precluded. So we would apply the same rule here. And then the question is just what's the appropriate methodology for determining that a person is one who ministers to the faithful."
2019.19-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1884.0,1890.0,Then her having cancer has nothing to do with the performance of her religious functions.
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1899.0,1900.0,"Yes, Justice --"
2019.19-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1900.0,1903.0,Yes?
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1903.0,1923.0,"So, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is the assertion, but, again, this Court said in Hosanna-Tabor that requiring a particular religious reason misses the point of the exemption and that it really is categorical once we're in the category of employment discrimination claims relating to hiring and firing."
2019.19-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.0,1937.0,"So, if it's categorical, why then doesn't it take care of the teacher who reports a student's claim of abuse by a priest?"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1937.0,1951.0,"So, again, I think that there may well be arguments that that type of retaliation claim would also have to be covered. My point is merely that the Court avoided deciding that in Hosanna-Tabor, and we think that it could continue to do so here."
2019.19-267,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1951.0,1966.0,"And it would be the same if what was reported that the principal of the school, Sister Mary Margaret, had been stealing from the school, from the school's till regularly, to pay for her gambling excursions to Las Vegas."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1973.0,2013.0,"So, Justice Ginsburg, again, all of this relates to what is the potential scope, what are the types of claims, and, in particular, retaliation claims, for which the -- to which the ministerial exception would apply. I think there are logical reasons why maybe some of those claims could come in, but we think the better approach -- excuse me, why maybe some of those claims would be covered by the ministerial exception, but we think the better approach is to continue to do what this Court did in Hosanna-Tabor and say we don't need to decide those sort of outlier cases right now, we're deciding things that relate to the employee/employer relationship and a hiring/firing claim under the employment --"
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2013.0,2015.0,"Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer?"
2019.19-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.0,2023.0,"Counsel, I'd -- I'd like to ask you about the -- your categorical line thought."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2098.0,2143.0,"Well, Your Honor, I think, at a minimum, you need to add the other categories that you discussed in Hosanna-Tabor. And it -- you specifically said this doesn't just apply to leaders of the congregation, it applies to other employees who preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. So we think that, at -- at a minimum, those teaching the faith during the week to schoolchildren and not just those preaching the faith on the weekend to adults are included within that category. And then, when we're talking about what it means to carry out the religion's mission, then we -- we think that there are other categories, some helpfully laid out by Justice Alito's concurrence, like worship, leadership, and rituals that would also come in."
2019.19-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.0,2157.0,"Why? Why if it's a plain teacher and teaches religion too, why is it necessary to keep out of it entirely, even if that teacher or whoever administrator is does discriminate on the basis of handicap?"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2157.0,2188.0,"Because, once you've made the decision that somebody is performing an important religious function, then this Court said in Hosanna-Tabor that getting into why they were dismissed misses the point because, at that point, the religious organization has to be capable of deciding who is going to minister to the faithful, who is going to fulfill that role of teaching Catholic schoolchildren that Jesus is the son of God and God created the world and this is the appropriate way to be Catholic."
2019.19-267,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.0,2189.0,Thank you.
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2189.0,2190.0,And --
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2190.0,2193.0,Justice Alito?
2019.19-267,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2193.0,2199.0,What do you think is the relevance of titles in this inquiry?
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2199.0,2206.0,"So, Justice Alito, we think that, of course, all the considerations that this Court mentioned in Hosanna-Tabor, including title, may be relevant."
2019.19-267,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2266.0,2292.0,"Well, how does it even help to understand the person's role? Suppose you have two people who do exactly the same thing in two different religiously affiliated schools, but one has a title and the other one doesn't have a title other than the title of teacher. Why should the presence or absence of this title make any difference?"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2292.0,2297.0,So it shouldn't in the circumstance where we know clearly what individuals are doing.
2019.19-267,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2326.0,2327.0,Thank you.
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2327.0,2331.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-267,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2331.0,2394.0,"Counsel, in your brief, you're encouraging us not just to define who's a minister by important religious function, but you're asking us to defer to the religious organization's determination of what's an important religious function. That's a recipe for saying the teacher who says a prayer at the beginning of a class, every teacher, whether it's a math teacher, a computer teacher, a gym teacher, they're doing an important religious function because all the -- all the school has to say is that's important to us, number one. Number two, I thought what Hosanna, our prior case, was recognizing is that when you're talking about a leader, a -- a person who stewards a religion, that they are entitled to this absolution."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2456.0,2478.0,"So, Justice Sotomayor, on your first question, I want to be very clear. When we're talking about deferring to religious organizations, we think that this Court has already outlined sort of objectively what would be considered this class of important religious functions, and the deference we're talking about are in those rare cases where there's some dispute about whether someone actually performs those."
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.0,2515.0,Justice Kagan?
2019.19-267,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2515.0,2554.0,"Ms. Ratner, I was struck by the emphasis that your brief gave to the idea that it was not important whether an individual was a member of a particular faith. As I understood it, that the central premise of the ministerial exception is that there are certain individuals within faith communities who have a particularly distinctive special role about how to propagate the faith. And if a position can be filled by any old person, not by a member of a faith, isn't that a pretty good sign that the employee doesn't have that special role within the religious community?"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2554.0,2559.0,"No, Justice Kagan, I don't think so, and -- and there are really several reasons."
2019.19-267,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2624.0,2663.0,"In -- in some of your answers, you've talked a lot about the language in Hosanna-Tabor, which is, you know, leading, preaching, teaching, and -- but, of course, Hosanna-Tabor connected that up with the title, with the training, with the formal commissioning. And when you take all of those things away and you're just left with those terms, ""preaching"" and ""teaching,"" that's when you get into all the tricky questions like, how much preaching? How much teaching? Of what kind? Any -- any prayer that you say during the day? Any amount of teaching? And -- and so how would we deal with that?"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2663.0,2676.0,"Again, I think the way to deal with that is by understanding there to be a baseline here that the religious functions of the type discussed in Hosanna-Tabor have to be a meaningful part of somebody's job duties."
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2686.0,2689.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-267,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2689.0,2704.0,"Counsel, elsewhere in the First Amendment and under RFRA, we have emphasized repeatedly that we do not inquire into how important the -- the plaintiff's religious belief is or how central it is to their faith."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2767.0,2770.0,"So, Justice Gorsuch, a couple points."
2019.19-267,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2829.0,2830.0,"Oh, well --"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2830.0,2831.0,-- board.
2019.19-267,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2831.0,2850.0,"-- there -- there exactly is the problem, ""usually."" ""Usually."" And that -- that discriminates in favor of majority conceptions about religious doctrine and teaching. Why couldn't we just simply say that a sincerely held religious belief about who is a minister should control, just like we do everywhere else in the First Amendment and in"
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2850.0,2859.0,"Again, Your Honor, everywhere else we're talking about sincerely held beliefs for purposes of, say, a free exercise claim or a RFRA claim."
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2881.0,2883.0,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-267,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2883.0,2886.0,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good afternoon, Ms. Ratner."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2904.0,2917.0,I think that's correct. I don't see how you could read the Court's decision in Hosanna-Tabor to adopt some sort of statutory constitutional avoidance analysis in the same vein as Catholic Bishop.
2019.19-267,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2921.0,2922.0,Okay.
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2922.0,2923.0,-- we're --
2019.19-267,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2923.0,2959.0,"You used the phrase ""teaching the faith."" And, of course, looking ahead, if you -- your side were to prevail in this case, to -- to future cases, what does ""teaching the faith"" mean, a similar question that I asked your colleague about instilling religious values, not just teaching specific doctrine. You know, a school could have a creed of instilling the value of being a person for others in all its students, and all the teachers and coaches are told to underscore that message in how they go about instructing or coaching the students."
2019.19-267,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,2970.0,3003.0,"So I think that those cases are obviously going to be more difficult. It's a heartland case when you're talking about the formal teaching of religious doctrine on a daily or near daily basis, as we have here and as the Court had in Hosanna-Tabor. If we're talking about something that looks more like modeling the faith, I think you're going to have to do a more context-specific analysis about whether, in practice, this particular position is expected to transmit the faith through that way. I certainly wouldn't say that categorically those individuals are -- are either out or in."
2019.19-267,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3028.0,3036.0,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rassbach, you have two minutes for rebuttal."
2019.19-267,2,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,3036.0,3038.0,Your Honor --
2019.19-267,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.0,3041.0,You don't have anything to rebut just yet.
2019.19-267,2,63241,eric_c_rassbach,,3041.0,3042.0,"Yes, sorry."
2019.19-267,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3042.0,3044.0,Mr. Fisher?
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3044.0,3055.0,Thank you.
2019.19-267,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3184.0,3196.0,"Mr. Fisher, I -- I think it's fair to describe your position compared to your friend's on the other side as more formalistic in using that word in a non-pejorative sense."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3233.0,3234.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-267,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.0,3320.0,Justice Thomas?
2019.19-267,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3320.0,3321.0,Yes.
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3342.0,3344.0,"Well, Justice Thomas, I think there's a yes-and-no answer to that."
2019.19-267,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3389.0,3401.0,"Well, let's -- I don't want to cut you off, Mr. Fisher, but what if they -- it's my understanding they actually led them from time to time in prayer or took them to service, things like that. That's what I mean."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3413.0,3418.0,"I think, Justice Thomas, the answer to that is -- is no, the prayer and worship would step over the line."
2019.19-267,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3448.0,3465.32,"But don't you think it's a bit odd that -- that things that would violate the Establishment Clause, when done in a public school, are not considered religious enough for free exercise protection when done in a parochial school?"
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3465.32,3473.0,"Well, Justice Thomas, I wholeheartedly agree that free exercise protection is available in this case."
2019.19-267,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3510.28,3517.72,"So the -- you -- you rely somewhat on the, as the Chief Justice said in a non-pejorative way, ministerial designation."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3524.92,3554.32,"Well, I think, Justice Thomas, the best way to do that in a -- in a religion that didn't use the kind of titles that the Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church use would be to do what Judge Wilkinson did in the Rayburn case, which is to say that if the person is performing all of the same things as -- as -- as -- as what would typically come with a title, then that may well be quite relevant. And I hasten to add, I just don't want to give the appearance that our test relies simply on title."
2019.19-267,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3591.56,3594.68,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-267,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3594.68,3600.88,I have the same question you were answering about discriminating against some hierarchical religions.
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3609.0,3612.52,"I think that will be true quite often, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.19-267,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3692.08,3714.52,"You don't seem to make much out of what I find very disturbing in all this, that the person can be fired or refused to be hired for a reason that has absolutely nothing to do with religion, like needing to take care of chemotherapy."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3714.52,3717.04,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't want to give that impression at all."
2019.19-267,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3857.6,3861.56,Thank you.
2019.19-267,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3861.56,3862.08,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-267,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3862.08,3865.32,"You said, counsel -- thank you very much."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3942.28,3968.24,"Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer that in -- first in terms of theory and second in terms of the experience in the courts for the past several decades. In terms of theory, I think you're absolutely right to be concerned about entanglement, and that's why we say the first thing you should write is the same thing you wrote at the beginning of Hosanna-Tabor, which is that to the extent that ministerial status can be gleaned from objective factors, that's where courts ought to look."
2019.19-267,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4181.36,4185.6,Justice Alito?
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4185.6,4215.64,"This issue can come up in many, many, many different contexts, as the questioning this morning has brought out, but what is before us is a very specific case or, rather, two very specific similar cases, and it has to do with teachers in a religiously affiliated elementary school. So suppose these teachers taught in a secondary school and they taught exactly one subject and that is religion."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4227.08,4239.2,"Justice Alito, is your assumption in that hypothetical that they -- that those teachers have no other indicia of ministerial status, that they don't have any special training or title or the like?"
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4239.2,4255.64,"Well, they have -- they have the training that the school thinks is sufficient and they are not labeled minister. Do you appreciate that the very term, minister, treats different religions differently? It is a predominantly Christian/Protestant term."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4267.64,4270.6,"Well, Justice --"
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4270.6,4271.68,Do they qualify?
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4271.68,4287.12,"-- Justice Alito, I think it's -- the reason I ask, and I apologize, is that I think it's going to be an uncommon situation where that person is going to have no other formal indicia of ministerial status."
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4287.12,4288.44,Does now having --
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4288.44,4292.12,But if you had that sort of a case -- I'm sorry.
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4292.12,4292.64,Go ahead.
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4292.64,4293.28,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4299.68,4302.72,Why would that person not be a minister?
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4302.72,4314.48,"The person wouldn't be a minister in that case because I think -- at least arguably, because even then the person would not be assuming a person -- a place -- a position of spiritual leadership of the congregation."
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4320.12,4321.88,Why was that the core --
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4321.88,4322.2,-- for me to --
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4322.2,4345.84,"-- of the -- I would be more comfortable if we jettisoned the whole term ""ministerial exception"" because I do think it's discriminatory, but why is there less of a religious autonomy issue and why is there not a very central religious autonomy issue there? The -- the function of teaching a religion to new generations is central."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4345.84,4365.84,"Yeah, Justice Alito, I don't deny that for one minute, and I think that is why the schools have every -- every ability to make free exercise arguments because of the absolute centrality of that function. But remember -- and I'm happy to jettison the ""ministerial exception"" label. What we're really talking about here is when are the schools or when are religious employers immune."
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4389.88,4390.96,"Well, what is the difference --"
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4390.96,4391.68,-- considerations in play.
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4391.68,4412.24,"-- what is the fundamental difference between that situation and the situation of an elementary school teacher who teaches everything, including religion? And for a school that is set up by a religious body, the teaching of religion is central. That is why -- that's the very reason why these schools are set up."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4435.48,4492.44,"I think the difference, Justice Alito, is when somebody teaches only religion and nothing else, their stature is as more of an expert on the faith and a preacher of the faith. When you have somebody who is a general curriculum teacher and who just happens to pick up the workbook for 40 minutes a day and teach religion during that segment of the day, that person isn't seen, I don't think, as -- as holding the same degree of position in -- in the church hierarchy in terms -- in terms of church leadership. And remember, Justice Alito, I don't think there's any possible way to distinguish the general curriculum teacher who teaches religion 40 minutes a day from the science teacher, the history teacher, the English teacher, who probably, once you tally up the number of minutes in that day where religion comes into play, is teaching at least 40 minutes worth of religion if not anything more. So just in terms of consequences, Justice Alito, you take a step from a very small group of teachers in schools to hundreds of thousands of teachers in K through 12 across the country --"
2019.19-267,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4492.44,4493.04,"Well, we may not --"
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4493.04,4494.12,-- and many hundreds of thousands more.

2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4504.16,4543.12,"Well, Justice Alito, just in terms of numbers, I think even there you have, I think, about 150,000 teachers in front of you in this case that as -- as the lower court case law developed for Hosanna-Tabor were never considered to be ministers. And I don't -- as I said, just with all due respect, I don't think there's any meaningful way to distinguish, as the Catholic bishops brief says, as the American Jewish Committee brief says, as the Catholic colleges brief says, all these briefs are on the other side of the case of mine -- from me, they all stress there's no way to distinguish somebody who teaches a secular subject with religion infused from somebody who teaches as my clients did in this case."

2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4555.44,4555.88,Correct.
2019.19-267,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4555.88,4593.72,"-- and argued that merely teaching two hours per week, spent teaching religion, that that didn't qualify her as a minister. It's now said something -- Ms. Ratner said something that has taken me by surprise, which is she seems to be saying that the Ninth Circuit got this particular case wrong because they were using labels as talismanic. Did you understand that argument by her? And, if you did, why is she wrong?"
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4593.72,4630.36,"Well, I -- I -- I think just in terms of what the Ninth Circuit did, the court was at -- was clear to say that we're not simply resting this on the absence of the label minister, but we're looking at all the factors in Hosanna-Tabor itself and saying that, overall, in the totality of the circumstances, there are not enough here. The Ninth Circuit also said in its opinion that no other court has deemed teachers like these to be ministers ever before that had so little religious leadership as part of their -- their duties. And they were -- the Ninth Circuit was right about that."

2019.19-267,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4842.88,4890.76,"Mr. Fisher, I'd like to take you back to Justice Alito's questions, because some of what you said surprised me. With respect to a teacher who is a full-time teacher of religion, teaching religious doctrine, teaching religious practice, teaching religious texts, any of those things, I would have thought that Hosanna-Tabor, even though it has the thing about commissioning and title and so forth, you know, thinks of those people whose job it is to teach religion and to basically bring up the next generation in important understandings of religious doctrine and practice, that those people would be covered. But you said no, and so I wanted to just sort of say why?"
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4890.76,4896.6,"Justice Kagan, I think what I said is I think that's the hardest case for me."
2019.19-267,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4952.08,4964.64,"Well, where do we draw that line then? I mean, suppose that I think that the full-time religion teacher is -- is protected by this exemption. Then I think Justice Alito raises a fair point here."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4974.6,4994.4,"I think that line holds up pretty well, Justice Kagan just in terms of just the basic idea that somebody teaching religion all day is going to be different than somebody teaching it just for a small part of the day as part of a general curriculum. And maybe this is the way to think about it, Justice Kagan."
2019.19-267,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5027.44,5052.36,"And -- and -- and what of the question of whether the person is a member of the faith? And, you know, as I suggested to Ms. Ratner, I was surprised by the emphasis that they put on that, but, on the other hand, I suppose I can think of there -- there -- you know, a -- a -- a yeshiva says that there's a non-Jewish great Talmud scholar and -- and -- and hires that person."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5054.96,5060.84,"Justice Kagan, we do not think that -- that co-religion is an -- is an on/off switch."

2019.19-267,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5154.04,5154.92,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-267,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5154.92,5208.2,"Counsel, so we've gone from the full-time religion teacher to the part-time religion teacher, and the line that I'm -- I'm trying to -- I'm struggling with that you're drawing there is the part-time teacher's less important, but what if the school can't afford one, a full-time teacher? Maybe they can only afford a part-time teacher. You -- you mentioned that you thought it important that they be part of the faith, but then you withdrew from that a bit, recognizing that one could be part of another faith and also minister in this faith, Protestants, Catholics, different reform sort of Jews, whatever. So where -- I'm struggling with where you draw the line and -- and how much entanglement you're -- you're going to get us -- both sides are going to get us in here in deciding what's an important enough person in -- in a particular faith and how we avoid that, that difficulty."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5208.2,5243.32,"So, Justice Gorsuch, let me talk first about the part-time hypothetical and then the importance and entanglement. On the part-time question, I -- I may not fully understand your hypothetical, but I -- but I -- but I think that if a school said we're limited funds, we want -- teaching religion in our school is very important to us, but we don't have the funds to hire a full-time religion teacher, we're just going to hire a part-time teacher, I think that whatever answer you would give to the full-time religion teacher who taught only religion would also apply to the part-time --"
2019.19-267,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5243.32,5244.04,"Okay, let me change --"
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5244.04,5244.32,-- teacher.
2019.19-267,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5244.32,5245.6,-- the hypothetical then.
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5266.28,5286.2,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, I think that Hosanna-Tabor itself, you know, if you're talking about that in terms of a labeling exercise, Hosanna-Tabor itself said that -- that that would not be enough. And I think that just again highlights the real issue in front of the Court."
2019.19-267,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5368.36,5368.68,Mr. Fisher --
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5368.68,5370.08,-- and a little less on the religion.
2019.19-267,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5370.08,5380.28,"-- you say that we -- we -- we -- we -- we can't -- we can't -- we shouldn't focus on -- on their sincerely held religious beliefs, but that is what we do elsewhere in -- in First Amendment jurisprudence."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5388.6,5390.44,"No, that's my point, Justice Gorsuch."

2019.19-267,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5486.72,5490.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon and welcome, Mr. Fisher."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5520.68,5567.68,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I haven't seen any empirical proof for that statement, and we don't see why that would be the case. Remember, the Ninth Circuit itself harmonized its decision with the Seventh Circuit's Grussgott case, which dealt with the Jewish Day School and said that even there, the teacher had special training to be teaching in that school and that teacher may well be different. And -- and, Justice Kavanaugh, if I would just return you -- I know I've said this before, but the cases we cite in red brief -- in our red brief in Footnote 1 deal with schools of the Christian faith, of Jewish faith, and I think even some other faiths. And across the board, we see a consistent treatment of lay teachers like our clients here being outside of the ministerial exception."
2019.19-267,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5568.44,5568.96,Okay.
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5592.32,5596.64,"Well, I -- I think the -- we agree with much of the concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.19-267,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5646.32,5646.64,Okay.
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5646.64,5649.0,And I think the way that we would tell the Court --
2019.19-267,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5649.0,5665.64,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to get another question or two in. You mentioned earlier a religious teacher who just picks up -- a religion teacher who just picks up the handbook and you referred to someone like that having no training. And I -- I guess I would question the training point."
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5672.8,5675.48,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh --"
2019.19-267,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5675.48,5676.76,How would you respond to that?
2019.19-267,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5676.76,5712.32,"Well, I -- I -- I think -- I think I'd respond to that by returning to one of Mr. Rassbach's own answers when he was asked is it enough to be a model or a witness. I think he said no. And so I think there's something more than being a model of the faith or using your own personal experience because I don't see how you would distinguish the teachers in this case if that were the -- a proper touchstone from the hundreds of thousands or millions of other employees of religious institutions who are told in their handbooks, in their contracts, by their supervisors to carry out themselves during work hours and their lives according to the faith."
2019.19-267,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5712.32,5717.68,"Thank you very much, Mr. Fisher."
