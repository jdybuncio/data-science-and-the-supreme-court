2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.651,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. Jones."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,8.29,12.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,54.804,59.773,"Knotts, though, seems to me much more like traditional surveillance."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,74.032,90.009,"The technology is different, Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that shows that this was not simply amplified visual surveillance is that the officers actually feared detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to Wisconsin."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,109.626,111.623,But that's a good example of the change in technology.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,128.743,139.974,"But it doesn't expose anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that was the crucial principle that the Court applied--"
2011.10-1259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.974,145.439,"Well, under that rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the man's overcoat or sport coat?"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,145.439,163.729,"--Probably not, Justice Kennedy; and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically distinguished the possibility of following a car on a public roadways from determining the location of an object in a place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy."
2011.10-1259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.729,164.197,"Oh -- oh, no."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,168.725,177.502,"In that event, Justice Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the installation of such a device would implicate either a search or a seizure."
2011.10-1259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.627,191.996,"And on that latter point, you might just be aware that I have serious reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about the way in which this beeper was installed."
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.075,196.512,"Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to get to it now."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,198.369,199.152,"Happy to, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.152,203.477,I have to give a little prologue to my question.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,305.421,319.647,"It may be a technical trespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the United States v. Karo when a can of ether was transferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio transmitter--"
2011.10-1259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.647,324.038,"Well, but the owner of the can at the time it was installed consented, and that is not this case."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,331.611,338.922,--But there was no consent to the owner of the can once he acquired it to have it contain a foreign item installed by the government.
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.922,339.967,"Well, that's too bad."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,342.217,343.107,"Well, this Court thought that it--"
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.107,347.762,"--It may be a sneaky thing to do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,347.762,363.739,"--Well, this Court thought that it was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made no difference because the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful interferences with possessory interests, not to cover all technical trespasses."
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.566,365.786,So we've narrowed the Fourth Amendment?
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,365.786,367.019,"--Well, I think the Court--"
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.019,372.08,"So the -- the privacy rationale doesn't expand it, but narrows it in some respects."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,372.08,375.563,"--It changes it, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.74,407.222,"Undoubtedly, but the rationale of that case was that it was not an unreasonable--"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,407.222,409.098,"No, the rationale was that--"
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.098,409.8,--it was not an unreasonable search.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,409.8,411.188,"--there was no search, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,422.856,431.306,"You think there would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month?"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,433.571,436.071,The justices of this Court?
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,436.071,436.539,Yes.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,440.13,448.206,"Under our theory and under this Court's cases, the justices of this Court when driving on public roadways have no greater expectation--"
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,448.206,457.437,"So your answer is yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no problem under the Constitution?"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,457.437,470.729,"--Well, equally, Mr. Chief Justice, if the FBI wanted to it could put its team of surveillance agents around the clock on any individual and follow that individual's movements as they went around on the public streets and they would thereby gather--"
2011.10-1259,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,470.729,505.12,"Well, that seems to get -- to me to get to what's really involved here, the issue of whether there is a technical trespass or not is potentially a ground for deciding this particular case, but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's presented by this case and will be presented by other cases involving new technology is that in the pre-computer, pre-Internet age much of the privacy -- I would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was not the result of legal protections or constitutional protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty of traveling around and gathering up information."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,557.986,566.669,"--I don't think, Justice Alito, that there is a particularly dramatic change in this case from what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.279,605.513,But it -- it is a third party involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,639.111,643.716,"--Well, we are talking here about monitoring somebody's movements in public."
2011.10-1259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.509,674.83,"But what -- but what is the question that I think people are driving at, at least as I understand it and certainly share the concern, is that if you win this case then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,725.762,730.979,"Justice Breyer, first of all, this is exactly the argument that was presented to the Court in Knotts."
2011.10-1259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,740.113,741.922,"Of course, that's true."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,771.488,781.689,--I first want to address the suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between a month and a trip and have a workable standard for police officers to use.
2011.10-1259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.228,817.502,"Well, there is the same kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I think it's used for example in the bribing the judge case, you know, with campaign contributions."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,839.68,842.771,--I'm suggesting that the Court do the same thing that it did in Knotts.
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.141,861.921,"Well, then you're -- you're moving away from your argument."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,874.463,876.775,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,876.775,887.018,"Well, isn't the normal way in these situations that we draw these limits how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,887.018,899.47,"When you're talking about the movements of a car on a public roadway, which even Justice Breyer's question seems to concede could be monitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no Fourth Amendment search -- unless--"
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,899.47,904.231,"Well, you're talking about the difference between seeing the little tile and seeing a mosaic."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,907.183,909.585,"--So does a pen register, so does a garbage pull."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,916.082,920.189,"Mr. Dreeben, this case started out with a warrant."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,962.873,967.089,"--In this case, there would not have been any difficulty getting a warrant, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1025.794,1032.763,"If you get an anonymous tip that there is the same bomb in somebody's house, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in?"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1032.763,1037.603,"--You do neither, because without probable cause you cannot enter the house."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.603,1040.149,Then why are you asking for a different rule in this situation?
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1040.149,1047.039,Because the -- the police in this situation have the traditional means available to investigate these sorts of tips.
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.831,1072.994,"You're -- you're now suggesting n answer to Justice Kennedy's question, which is it would be okay to take this computer chip, put it on somebody's overcoat and follow every citizen everywhere they go indefinitely."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1113.012,1113.901,--I think that--
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1113.901,1124.585,"--to track them, to invade their sense of integrity in their choices about who they want to see or use their things."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1125.895,1136.58,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think that that goes considerably farther than our position in this case, because our position is not that the Court should overrule United States v. Karo and permit monitoring within a private residence."
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1152.716,1154.073,Cars get parked in a garages.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1154.713,1160.679,"Yes, but a car that's parked in a garage does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to its location."
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1161.666,1162.383,Neither does a person.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1167.613,1178.296,"--Once the -- once the effect is in the house, under Karo there is an expectation of privacy that cannot be breached without a warrant, and we are not asking the Court to overrule that."
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1178.296,1182.453,Tell me what the difference between this and a general warrant is?
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1183.904,1185.406,A general warrant--
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1185.406,1213.97,"--what motivated the Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the outrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately to investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not probable cause and to invade every possession that the individual had in search of a crime."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1215.111,1216.25,--A warrant authorizes--
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1216.25,1224.139,"--this kind of surveillance where there is no probable cause, there is not even necessarily reasonable suspicion in--"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1224.139,1227.59,--A warrant authorizes a search.
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.159,1254.766,"What if we -- I give you that, that it's in public."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1277.929,1284.192,"--Well, something that takes place in public isn't inherently off limits to a reasonable expectation of privacy."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1303.451,1323.987,"You can see, though, can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the police following you, you might get one answer, while today if you ask people does it violate your right to privacy to know that the police can have a record of every movement you made in the past month, they might see that differently?"
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1323.987,1333.875,"They probably would also feel differently about being followed 24/7 by a team of FBI agents, who gain far more information than a GPS device produces."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.62,1340.09,And speed as well.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1340.09,1346.931,"The approximate speed, the location traveled, that -- that is what the GPS provides."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.523,1359.694,"An easy way, to pick someone up for speeding when you suspect something far worse but have no probable cause."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1359.694,1367.626,"--Well, this Court held in Whren v. United States that when the police have probable cause to stop someone for a traffic violation they can do that."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.283,1373.498,That was when the police came upon the violator.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1391.304,1398.443,"--Justice Ginsburg, it's not very hard for police to follow somebody and find a traffic violation if they want to do that."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.068,1436.506,But the Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1476.613,1500.837,"I'm quite sure, Justice Ginsburg, that if you ask citizens whether the police could freely pick up their trash for a month and paw through it looking for evidence of a crime, or keep a record of every telephone call that they made for the duration and the number that it went through, or conduct intense visual surveillance of them, that citizens would probably also find that to be, in the word that Respondents choose to use--"
2011.10-1259,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.837,1506.819,But they won't and probably couldn't physically.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1541.353,1543.025,--I think -- all right.
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1562.001,1563.517,--This case is not that vehicle.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1563.517,1564.906,--If the Court--
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1564.906,1579.572,"The GPS technology today is limited only by the cost of the instrument, which frankly right now is so small that it wouldn't take that much of a budget, local budget, to place a GPS on every car in the nation."
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1579.572,1580.024,--Well I think that--
2011.10-1259,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1580.024,1581.431,Almost every car has it now.
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1581.431,1588.053,"--Well, I think it would be virtually impossible to use the kinds of tracking devices that were used in this case on everyone, because--"
2011.10-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.053,1590.833,Don't we have any legislatures out there that could stop this stuff?
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1590.833,1623.117,"--Justice Scalia, the legislature is a safeguard, and if the Court believes that there needs to be a Fourth Amendment safeguard as well, we have urged as a fallback position that the Court adopt a reasonable suspicion standard, which would allow the police to conduct surveillance of individuals in their movements on public roadways, which they can do visually in any event, and would allow the police to investigate leads and tips that arise under circumstances where there is not probable cause."
2011.10-1259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1623.117,1627.723,Who would be under your test the judge of the reasonable suspicion?
2011.10-1259,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1627.723,1636.953,"As in most reasonable suspicion cases, it's the police at the front end and it's the courts at the back end if there are motions to suppress evidence."
2011.10-1259,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.931,1659.336,Thank you.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1664.491,1667.318,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1692.244,1694.573,What is the size of this device?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1694.573,1695.259,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1695.259,1696.682,What is the size of this device?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1696.682,1710.408,"The record doesn't show in this case, but we know -- we learned last week, Justice Alito, from the NACDL that there is now a GPS on the market that weighs 2 ounces and is the size of a credit card."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1717.657,1719.186,What if it was put on the license place.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1723.889,1729.839,"Well, a license plate as I understand it is the property of the State and driving is a privilege."
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.651,1736.055,I didn't own my license plate?
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.914,1745.317,"We don't need to get into it, but ""Live Free Or Die""--"
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1745.317,1757.343,"--What I'm saying, Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia, is this: That the issue insofar as the seizure is concerned is, is it meaningful."
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.729,1771.9,I didn't -- I didn't hear an answer to Justice Alito's question.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1777.288,1777.741,They can't do it.
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1780.1,1780.787,It's a--
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1780.787,1781.582,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1781.582,1792.953,"--If my understanding is correct that it's the State's license plate that they require you to have, so your trespass theory it would seem falls apart with respect to that particular scenario."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1792.953,1799.765,"Well, first of all, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, my -- you would probably see the GPS and in that case--"
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.765,1799.921,No.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1802.651,1810.711,"--In that particular case, what you have done is you have -- the installation of the GPS, it is a seizure."
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.554,1814.634,"Well, this is ridiculous."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1829.456,1829.971,That's correct.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.971,1836.389,And whether it's put directly on the car or directly on something that the car is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any difference.
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1836.389,1844.044,"I thought it made a difference under your theory, which focused on the question of trespass, because it was attached to an effect owned by somebody else."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1846.197,1846.961,That's correct.
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.961,1850.65,So the trespass theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1850.65,1852.007,"But it's an effect, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1862.051,1871.079,"Mr. Leckar, I guess I'm not sure I quite understand the argument, because a trespass is accomplished no matter what you put on somebody's car or somebody's overcoat or what have you."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1886.463,1888.432,"--As I -- thank you, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.894,1901.503,So it doesn't make it a seizure.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1904.206,1905.142,--Your Honor--
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.142,1911.498,"I mean, you can say that there is a trespass for the purpose of obtaining information, which makes it a search."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1922.931,1926.367,--What has been seized is Antoine's -- data.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.786,1942.254,Do you have any case involving seizure of -- of data floating in the air as opposed to papers?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1942.254,1952.154,"--The closest case I could come, Your Honor, would be Silverman, where the Court called a Fourth Amendment violation where the spike mike just touched -- touched the ventilator unit."
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.154,1956.654,"It's not a violation unless, in addition to a search, it is an unreasonable search."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1960.308,1960.885,That's right.
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.885,1963.166,So you already have everybody agrees it's at least a search.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,1978.846,1979.423,That's right.
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.423,1981.518,And I think that's the question we've been debating.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2025.963,2030.76,"Reasonable suspicion, Justice Breyer, is something that the Court has adopted for limited intrusions."
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2060.42,2060.966,How do you know that?
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2060.966,2062.338,--Why does it have to be cost-free.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2077.129,2087.72,"--What happens is the police have the capacity with GPS to engage in grave abuse, grave abuse of individual and group liberties, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2087.72,2095.905,But suppose what they got is nothing more than what they would have had if they had 30 deputies staked out along the route.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2101.685,2103.794,"Yes, if they use a GPS, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2106.963,2107.587,"Well, no."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2128.751,2129.422,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2130.202,2140.263,"I'm fully aware of the 1984 ministry of love, ministry of -- of peace problem."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2148.93,2150.615,--I think I can help you with that.
2011.10-1259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2189.068,2204.643,"But he wouldn't -- he wouldn't be protected against a surveillance camera that could get information, and is this really different in kind from the surveillance camera?"
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2204.643,2205.049,--Yes.
2011.10-1259,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2240.643,2241.672,What is the difference really?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2257.996,2259.337,--It's pretty scary.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.385,2264.212,"Well, it must be unconstitutional if it's scary."
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.537,2282.048,"And in fact, those cameras in London actually enabled them, if you watched them, I got the impression, to track the bomber who was going to blow up the airport in Glasgow and to stop him before he did."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2293.763,2294.667,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.855,2299.432,And what Justice Kagan wanted to know is why not.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2299.432,2301.663,--Because you have a physical invasion of property.
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.663,2302.104,"Oh, my goodness."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2333.245,2334.808,"It's not, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.75,2357.628,"But you're -- you're mixing, you're mixing two things."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2370.59,2376.479,"Well, but technology, as you observed, Justice Kennedy, is dramatically different with GPS than was present in Karo."
2011.10-1259,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2376.479,2378.838,But it's going to be dramatically different in the next step.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2398.877,2399.532,Well--
2011.10-1259,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2399.532,2401.232,So if -- give us a theory.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2415.291,2422.552,"--Our theory, Justice Sotomayor, with respect to video camera, if they are targeting an individual, this presents a gray question."
2011.10-1259,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2441.624,2443.655,I think there are about 28 satellites up there.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2443.655,2444.373,--All right.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.947,2467.818,"Mr. Leckar, your -- all of this discussion, you're going into it, but the questioning leads you into it, it seems to me leaps over the difficult part of your case."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2535.165,2536.038,No.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.038,2536.787,Why?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2540.726,2544.676,Because it is -- it is a complete robotic substitute.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.123,2559.685,100 times zero equals zero.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2574.694,2581.55,"Justice Scalia, what -- I'm going to refer to your dissent along with Justice Breyer in Bond v. United States."
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.656,2593.233,So is a tail.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2597.826,2600.715,"--The question we have to answer in this case, Justice Scalia, is this."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2619.847,2620.818,"Well, where would you draw the line?"
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2630.516,2637.465,"Our position, Justice Alito, is, no circumstances should a GPS be allowed to be put on somebody's car."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2638.217,2640.916,Put aside -- put aside the trespass question.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2640.916,2643.431,--I'm not addressing it purely as a trespass.
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2667.624,2669.063,"Well, that sounds like a legislative line."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2682.886,2685.853,"Because it's an unreasonable invasion of privacy, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2685.853,2697.22,What -- what is the difference in terms of one's privacy whether you're followed by a police officer for 12 hours and you don't see the officer or whether you're monitored by GPS for 12 hours?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2697.22,2706.798,"Because -- because what you have here is society does not expect that the police, the human element would be taken out of -- would be taken out of the surveillance factor."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2706.798,2709.734,"You know, I don't know what society expects and I think it's changing."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2738.002,2740.501,"Well, the use of a cell phone, there are two ways of looking at it."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2778.595,2780.218,"Well, that -- maybe that's a good way to decide the case."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2798.681,2804.96,"If it were nothing more than a note, say, or even a bumper sticker like you get at South of the Border, probably nothing."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2804.96,2805.724,You don't even see it.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2808.895,2812.08,It's a little wafer that's got an enormous capacity.
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2812.08,2818.359,"But this one does nothing, and you -- so you would go -- you would sue -- you would bring a trespass action."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2818.359,2819.689,"No, heavens, no, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2821.704,2825.483,So what's you're concerned about is not this little thing that's put on your car.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2829.902,2832.23,The monitoring makes it meaningful.
2011.10-1259,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2833.512,2839.915,"But to ask Justice Alito's question in a different way, suppose that the police could do this without ever committing the trespass."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2852.549,2859.39,"--As I assume, that's because of manufacturers doing it, or because Congress has legislated it, Justice Kagan?"
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2908.683,2916.962,"Lots of communities have, including Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on stop lights."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2933.468,2936.155,"I think that would be allowable, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.872,2937.672,You think it would be?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2937.672,2939.875,"--I think that would be permissible, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2945.701,2947.729,You have -- you have a targeted invasion.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2957.697,2958.383,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2989.883,2990.386,What a--
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2990.386,2991.587,--The camera is one site -- one--
2011.10-1259,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2991.587,2996.212,--What an unworkable rule with no -- tethered to no principle.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,2996.212,2997.632,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-1259,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2997.632,3001.66,What an unworkable rule tethered to no principle.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3006.611,3008.44,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3045.267,3052.843,"Well, that gets back to Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to determine that there has been a search first before you impose the warrant requirement."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3059.543,3060.92,That's -- and seizures.
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.92,3060.967,Okay.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3070.884,3075.711,"But if you know, if you the police agents know -- this is the deliberative process."
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.808,3103.136,Now we pushed your -- we pushed your friend to the limits of his theory.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3113.24,3113.708,Yes.
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3113.708,3117.865,"Don't talk to me about how long they are going to be doing it, or all the information."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3124.439,3131.435,"I -- I think it does, Your Honor, because of the -- society does not expect -- society views it as objectively reasonable not to expect--"
2011.10-1259,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3131.435,3132.278,You said that several times.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3155.05,3157.628,--You look to -- you look to the common law.
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.233,3167.607,Excellent.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3189.6,3190.193,We have--
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.193,3195.738,Why isn't this precisely the kind of a problem that you should rely upon legislatures to take care of?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3195.738,3202.937,--That's the same -- that's the same -- same problem that the United States advanced before this Court in the United States v. District Court; give it to Congress.
2011.10-1259,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3235.687,3237.091,Can you take it to Congress the other way?
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3276.31,3282.088,"Justice Breyer, that was exactly what Congress, what happened when the foreign intelligence surveillance courts were created."
2011.10-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.884,3295.32,I don't see why it's any of Congress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely intrastate operation.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3311.983,3314.154,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3357.697,3359.323,There was a warrant -- there was a warrant in this case.
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3388.343,3390.215,--They had the choice.
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3394.918,3395.354,"No, that's not my point."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3411.818,3412.349,--No.
2011.10-1259,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3417.769,3420.327,"Not a warrantless intrusion, there was a warrant."
2011.10-1259,1,41652,stephen_c_leckar,,3420.327,3422.734,--But the warrant was not in effect.
2011.10-1259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.45,3433.247,I think that's been conceded by both sides and that's accepted by both sides.
