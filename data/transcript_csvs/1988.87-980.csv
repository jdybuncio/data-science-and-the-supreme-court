1988.87-980,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-980, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Orrey Curtiss Holyfield, et ux."
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,51.433,57.753,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-980,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.06,150.778,"Mr. Smith, I'm troubled a little bit by what might be a standing problem here."
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,154.249,155.399,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-980,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.399,185.035,"Well, supposing this were a case that didn't involve Indian tribes, but involved people in California, say, getting a divorce from one another and the State of Nevada felt very strongly, since they had been both domiciled in Nevada, that Nevada courts should have had jurisdiction rather than the California courts, do you think the State of Nevada by itself could come before us and say, well, the California courts had no jurisdiction here, they should have done it in Nevada?"
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,185.035,187.137,"No, sir, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-980,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.457,200.445,"Well, does the statute say in so many words that the Mississippi Band shall have a standing to raise this sort of a question?"
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,200.445,211.418,"--The... the statute provides a vested interest in the tribe in the placement of its Indian children, and that is precisely what's at stake here."
1988.87-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.106,223.993,"Well, I suppose you could say the Tenth Amendment gives the State of Nevada a vested interest, too."
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,235.784,239.736,"Yes, sir, Your Honor, I believe they do."
1988.87-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.541,289.419,"Mr. Smith, I guess the statute in section 1911 says the Indian child's tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding, in a state court proceeding, involving termination of parental rights."
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,290.62,291.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.72,295.672,And the tribe did intervene pursuant to that statute?
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,295.672,303.678,"The tribe filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the state court lacked jurisdiction over this proceeding."
1988.87-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.214,308.416,Is that tantamount to an intervention in the proceeding?
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,308.416,310.016,"--Yes, I would say it was tantamount to--"
1988.87-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.016,313.301,And what was the timing of that motion by the tribe?
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,313.301,319.974,--The motion was filed as soon as the tribe learned that the adoption had gone on through.
1988.87-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.107,324.342,Was that after the adoption had become final?
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,324.342,356.313,"--That was after the adoption became final, but important to this case I think to understand is that even before the children were born, the tribe had become aware that the adoption was going to take place and had notified the proposed adopting couple, as well as their counsel, that there was this federal law that did govern, and that the... the natural mother was resident, domiciled on the reservation, and that therefore 1911(a) would vest exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal court."
1988.87-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.313,365.336,"Well, how long after the adoption decree was issued by the trial court did the tribe intervene?"
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,365.336,373.941,"I am not certain, but I believe it was something like three or four weeks."
1988.87-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.445,383.13,Wasn't it between January 28 and March 31 or the two months?
1988.87-980,0,23142,edwin_r_smith,,383.13,383.497,--Yes.
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,1803.277,1809.348,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-980,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.243,1911.582,"Well, I take it you concede, however, that the mother never changed her lawful domicile from the reservation."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,1913.649,1914.618,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-980,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.951,1924.223,"And the court below made the issue of domicile turn on a theory of abandonment, I take it."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,1924.223,1924.806,--That was one of the issues.
1988.87-980,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2139.313,2139.646,"Well, Mr. Miller--"
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2139.646,2139.896,"--Yes, ma'am?"
1988.87-980,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2139.896,2160.559,"--What Congress did say in Section 1915 was that in any adoptive placement of an Indian child under state law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to placement with a member of the child's extended family, other members of the Indian child's tribe and other Indian families."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2165.511,2167.027,"Yes, ma'am, I would say so."
1988.87-980,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2167.027,2170.729,And did the state court here follow that preference?
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2170.729,2176.117,"Justice O'Connor, they did not because they looked at the part which deals with the good cause."
1988.87-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.78,2210.373,"Well, Mr. Miller, whether you're under this... this Indian law or not, whether you're an Indian or not, it's... it's simply not the case that if you choose not to keep a child yourself, you have the right to place that child where you like."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2219.646,2234.822,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1988.87-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.972,2275.447,"Well, but the statute clearly says that with... with respect to... with respect to a married couple on the Indian reservation, for example, even if they had a child off the reservation, there is no doubt where the child's domicile would be."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2288.29,2290.357,"Well, that is a good question, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.357,2292.242,"--That would put a big hole in the statute, wouldn't it?"
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2292.242,2293.192,I agree it would.
1988.87-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.392,2325.396,"No, I'm talking about the same situation as we have here except that the Indian couple are married, as opposed to what was the case here that they were not."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2325.396,2327.498,"I don't think that that would change it, Your Honor."
1988.87-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.498,2328.082,It wouldn't change it.
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2328.648,2330.284,In my opinion.
1988.87-980,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2330.284,2342.257,"Mr. Miller, when I practiced law 100 years ago and got in the adoption courts now and then, private placements were definitely frowned upon."
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2344.293,2345.259,"No, sir, it is not."
1988.87-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2348.461,2356.548,"Isn't there substantial law to the effect that on abandonment, the child takes the domicile of the parent?"
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2356.548,2360.602,The adoptive parent or the persons with whom it's--
1988.87-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.602,2361.452,The natural parents.
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2361.452,2366.422,"--Oh, Your Honor, not to my knowledge."
1988.87-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.826,2379.58,"So, the abandonment... whenever there's an abandonment, the child takes the domicile of the place where the abandonment takes place?"
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2379.58,2386.417,--That's correct according to our court and according to Alaska's Supreme Court in an '86 decision which is mentioned in--
1988.87-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.417,2389.102,"The restatement is contrary, is it not?"
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2389.102,2391.971,"--Well, I think that--"
1988.87-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2391.971,2392.771,Restatement on Conflicts?
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2392.771,2395.423,"--Yes, sir, I would think."
1988.87-980,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.676,2531.794,Where is Section 1913?
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2537.781,2539.364,--It's in the supplement [inaudible]... Justice Scalia.
1988.87-980,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.364,2540.9,The... okay.
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2542.483,2547.72,"In Section 1913, there is a safeguard even in the voluntary proceeding."
1988.87-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.115,2574.453,They... they don't trump the... the requirement as to which courts have jurisdiction.
1988.87-980,1,22754,edward_o_miller,,2580.624,2581.041,That's correct.
