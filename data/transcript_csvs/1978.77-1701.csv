1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.87,We will hear arguments next in Rose against Mitchell.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,15.589,23.275,Thank you.
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,313.259,317.85,Does the Grand Jury of vote have to unanimous in Tennessee?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,317.85,323.085,No sir it requires that 12 grand jurors indict.
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,323.085,324.888,Otherwise it takes a vote of 12.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,324.888,332.43,Yes sir and the foreman is under Tennessee law the 13th Grand Juror and may vote.
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,332.43,339.651,And under Tennessee law before a person can be tried for this kind of an offense must he be indicted by a grand jury or can there be an information?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,339.651,342.842,Must be Grand Jury Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.842,349.217,Are the Grand Juries statutorily regulated as to size that they all theoretically are 13?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,349.217,354.483,"Yes sir, yes sir Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.483,361.102,"Mr. Attorney General, I may have missed your stating at -- but does the record show the race of the victims in this murder case?"
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,361.102,361.953,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,375.046,382.157,Can you challenge incidentally the conclusions of the Court below that the respondents made out a prima facie case?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,382.157,383.496,"No sir, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,408.166,415.753,"How about the judges of that Court, what's the history there, any Negroes ever been judges of that court?"
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,416.253,422.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's not in the record and I have no personal recollection."
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,422.474,426.028,Have no personal collection either way?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,426.028,428.762,"No sir, either way."
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.714,626.879,Is there anything in the record as to what the foreman does?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,626.879,627.541,I am sorry Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,627.541,632.998,Is there anything in the record or any place else to tell you what the foreman does?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,632.998,638.568,Yes the statutory prescription of the foreman's duty is in the record further the--
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,638.568,641.026,Is there anything beyond the statute?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,641.026,667.559,"Yes, the foreman of the grand jury did submit an affidavit before the federal magistrate at the District Court level in which he stated in this case that he did not vote and that he did preside basically we contend that the foreman's chore is basically ministerial and administrative and that it assists in the organizing of the grand jury scheduling of witnesses."
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.428,683.346,"Well I am not asking his reporting, what does he do?"
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,684.657,698.858,"No sir, he schedules the witnesses, he schedules the witnesses who are to appear, he asks them questions and then he turns to the other members of the grand jury and ask them if they have any questions of the witness."
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,698.858,700.39,So he does have something to do with.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,700.39,701.37,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.37,703.16,He sits out as a Chairman or the President?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,703.16,706.584,"Yes sir, he is Chairman of the grand jury."
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,706.584,712.44,Can the juror A call a witness that he does more?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,716.434,718.726,"No sir, under Tennessee law --"
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,718.726,720.519,You said he calls the witnesses.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,720.519,726.248,He schedules them or does the ministerial function of calling them.
1978.77-1701,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,726.248,739.641,Well I mean if the -- formally the grand jury decides who will testify and who will not testify then that's just not a perfunctory position?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,739.641,771.807,"Mr. Justice Marshall he does not make the -- he is not the solo arbiter of who testify -- any grand juror can insist on or ask to hear from a witness, as a practical matter, I think most District Attorney's General who have charge of the grand jury schedule and report on the indictment form who the witnesses are as a result of the investigation from the law enforcement officer."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.517,801.982,"Mr. Attorney General, you are saying there hasn't been any extension -- to a foreman."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,812.047,827.52,"Yes sir on the grand jury, on the grand jury, we would on to the rationale encompassed in Stone and that Tennessee has a full and fair trial and appellate practice and is more --"
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.52,833.656,So that issue on the grand jury just wouldn't be open in federal collateral relief.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,833.656,836.659,"Under habeas corpus, there is a collateral tag, yes."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.659,857.447,"So your position does encompass that, that and so it really -- well I take it you are saying that even if Stone against Powell would pick up challenges to the grand jury in general, it shouldn't pick up challenges to the foreman is that it or --?"
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,857.447,858.314,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.314,861.257,Or should they both be treated the same?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,861.257,879.316,"I would say of course there is a line at some point in which we, there is a breaking point, obviously we haven't gone to the arresting officer, we haven't gone to the committing magistrate in the manner in which that individual is selected."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.387,924.3,"A federal habeas corpuses has been available on the grand jury for a long time, isn't it?"
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,924.3,925.09,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.09,948.682,"Well as understood your position to be with respect to singling out the foreman of the grand jury, that not necessarily just under federal habeas but as a matter of federal constitutional law, in this particular case where the foreman does invoke the general rule applying in the presumption of prima facie case that grand jury shouldn't apply just because of this particular foreman."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,948.682,950.451,"In this particular case, yes."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.451,953.949,I understand your position to be that too.
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,953.949,988.39,"Mr. Attorney General just, so I'll be sure I understand your position, I had understood it to be that quite without regard to the foreman, let's assume that you didn't have any foreman, you had a 12-man jury that on, a grand jury that indicted the defendant and there after the defendant was tried before a petit jury, the composition of which was not questioned and the defendant was found guilty, and then the case went its way through direct review and ends up in federal habeas corpus."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1007.375,1008.173,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1008.173,1012.401,"Well I wonder, why you talk so much about the foreman, I take it that's an alternative position."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1012.401,1022.586,Yes we just simply say that since it has never been extended to the foreman it has been extended as has been pointed out to grand jury composition--
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1022.586,1033.855,But in how many cases was it extended to the grand jury and habeas corpus while the composition of the petit jury also had not been attacked.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1033.855,1035.336,A number of --
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1035.336,1038.829,Well how many?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1038.829,1039.352,I really don't know --
1978.77-1701,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1039.352,1044.42,This question ever raised in any of those cases.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1047.637,1055.647,I really don't know as to the numerical breakdown.
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1055.647,1068.408,"But your point I take it is that whatever maybe the law with respect to the membership of, the voting members of the grand jury that has no bearing on the selection of the foreman."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1068.408,1071.155,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice that's correct."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.974,1119.263,"Now but that's on the basis and a constitutional issue, it isn't on the applicability of Stone against Powell."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1119.263,1121.752,On the basis of constitutional issue.
1978.77-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.752,1126.966,"Well it's and on the basis of, it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1126.966,1127.93,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1144.966,1159.583,And harmless beyond a reasonable doubt argument would it not always be true that's any defect in the grand jury proceeding will be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if you got a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at the trial by the petit jury.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1159.583,1163.929,Yes sir in the absence of an actual showing of prejudice which I cannot --
1978.77-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.929,1167.572,How could there ever be one on the man that's proved beyond a reasonable doubt that'll be guilty.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1177.836,1181.853,In the absence of an actual showing of prejudice.
1978.77-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1181.853,1192.65,"Well even if there was prejudice would then still be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, that is prejudice at the grand jury stage because -- if the man had a fair trial, if we assume the man had a fair trial was found guilty."
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.65,1203.405,"In other words, isn't the petit jury that determines guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, doesn't that wash out any possible error in selection of the grand jury?"
1978.77-1701,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1203.405,1213.382,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, although I would hesitate saying it possible because I could envision some Grand Jury participation beyond their regular role or --."
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.382,1225.706,"Well, if that turned out that there are only ten grand jurors and the Tennessee Law requires 12, then maybe there wouldn't be any indictment, that's possible right?"
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.706,1230.129,Wouldn't that even be harmless beyond reasonable doubt because you've been proven guilty at a fair trial?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1240.522,1265.582,"Well, if indictment itself is faulty in Tennessee Law, whatever occurred in the trial is void because a defendant cannot stand trial in Tennessee without first being indicted and so if the indictment is faulty and it is shown that it is defective even in State Court."
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1265.582,1267.913,That's a matter of state law is it not essentially?
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1267.913,1270.092,"Yes, it's a matter of state --"
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.092,1276.415,I would think then that Grand Jury could never be harmless error.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1276.415,1278.894,"No sir, not in State Court."
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.224,1292.668,"Wasn't validly indicted, then his entire conviction must fall under Tennessee Law."
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1292.668,1293.019,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.019,1302.206,And no one in federal habeas could say that harmless error.
1978.77-1701,0,45380,william_m_leech,,1302.206,1307.786,I request to reserve few moments in rebuttal.
1978.77-1701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1307.786,1314.675,Very well Mr. Attorney General.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1317.488,1320.94,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court."
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.088,1374.509,Which one of those do you read first?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1374.509,1384.896,"Well, I had planned to begin with the discrimination issue in my argument, but of course logically if Your Honors were to expand Stone versus Powell."
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.896,1389.81,That's sort of non-constitutional isn't it?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1389.81,1392.506,"The jurisdiction -- No, the habeas --"
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.506,1403.301,"Yes, the Stone against Powell issue is a -- if Stone against Powell bars any review here we never reached our constitutional issue I take it."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1403.301,1405.57,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.832,1458.438,"Mr. Kurtz before you get to that, would you tell me what period of time your evidence covered with respect to no black ever serving as foremen on the grand jury?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1458.438,1465.291,"Yes, Your Honor it covered a period of time from the early ‘50s to 1972, I say the early --"
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.291,1468.177,Continuously?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1468.177,1470.056,That's what the Court of Appeal found Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.056,1472.735,"Well, what does the record show?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1475.756,1492.847,"Nobody has found there to be gaps, but I -- but there were three grand -- prior Grand Jury foreman testifying, one who would served in early ‘50s, all of them testified that it was in their memory they could not recall a black grand jury foreman."
1978.77-1701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.258,1510.131,One of the three testified he didn't know at all.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1512.679,1515.951,I don't recall that Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.927,1542.873,"While we're in that area and since I take it you are a practitioner in that area, do you know as an officer the Court whether any judge of that Court has -- since 1900 let us say."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1542.873,1544.185,"No your Honor, I do not."
1978.77-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.582,1560.964,What's the city near that?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1560.964,1582.34,"Covington, Tennessee is the county seat Your Honor and I would correct the Attorney General on one thing, Tipton County does border on Shelby County and rather being in Northwest corner it is in the Southwest corner of the state."
1978.77-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1582.34,1585.572,At least one Negro judge in Memphis.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1585.572,1590.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1716.724,1732.738,"What if you had a case, this is hypothetical now, where since Tennessee was admitted to the union, the records show that the judge of this courts that we are dealing with had always been a White male."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1739.779,1741.352,"I don't think so Your Honor, because --"
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1741.352,1743.371,"Why not, why not?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1743.371,1745.392,In Tennessee judges are elected.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1745.392,1747.405,Yes.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1756.143,1768.659,"Well, that's certainly true Your Honor, but I don't think that this Court has ever involved itself in the motivation of individual voters that comprise an electorate."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1768.659,1770.492,That shouldn't stop you.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1776.275,1784.966,"It may not stop me Mr. Chief Justice, but of course I'm not here to argue that point."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.966,1790.958,"No, but we often explore with hypothetical questions the reach of an argument that's presumptuous."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1790.958,1794.252,But I do think that selection process there is certainly different.
1978.77-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.307,1859.62,"Even when he selected the members of grand jury, he didn't select the members of the grand jury, did he?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1859.62,1863.189,No I guess I used that and it's sort of generic term Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1903.903,1912.277,"In the process of the petit jury that tries criminal case, who does the selecting there?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1912.277,1924.346,The petit jury is chosen from the master jury list or venire Your Honor and it comes from the same basic path of jurors that the grand jurors are drawn from.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.346,1934.497,"Who -- what's the mechanics of actually bringing 40, or 50, or a 100 people in at a given time -- Does it require a commissioner or jury commissioner or what?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,1934.497,1952.242,"Commissioners chose the master jury list, but then as I recall the clerk administers a system by which names are put in a pot and until recently a 10 year old child was brought in and drew out names at random."
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.022,1987.129,Mr. Kurtz I am little bit concerned about the same point that Mr. Justice Blackmun raised with you earlier about the actual existence of a prima facie case.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2008.355,2027.987,"Well I don't believe it's a clearly erroneous test Your Honor, because for one thing there is no evidentiary hearing in the district court, none whatsoever it was based solely upon the statistical information available that there hadn't been any blacks, the judge, and the judges' affidavit."
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.927,2047.783,"The Court of Appeals didn't send it back for an evidentiary hearing, it simply, it said the habeas writ issue, didn't it?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2047.783,2059.081,"Yes Your Honor, because I think that they felt confident that the district judge had applied the facts or the law improperly to the facts."
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.081,2068.065,Did the state ever have an opportunity to rebut if the prima facie case even if the district court had agreed with the magistrate that a prima facie case has been made out.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2068.065,2074.514,Yes Your Honor and I do disagree with you that the district court did not find a prima facie case.
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.17,2112.573,"So you said the district court said, gave the state an opportunity to respond?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2112.573,2115.897,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2248.288,2249.668,Are you suggesting that --
1978.77-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2249.668,2265.179,"We all practice law and I don't know what happens in the grand jury room that -- you don't happen to go in -- I don't know, I thought all lawyers were provided -- Is that true in Tennessee?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2265.179,2266.762,That is also true in Tennessee.
1978.77-1701,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.762,2268.945,Well how do you know what goes on in there?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2268.945,2288.043,"Well we don't know exactly what goes on but I think that we are well aware of certainly the power of the foreman of the petit jury, the power of any chairman or leader of a small group and we can extrapolate from that as to the power of the foreman."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2290.361,2299.093,"Are you suggesting that a member of the grand jury, any member of the grand jury, any member of the grand jury can call any witness he or she wants to call?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2299.093,2302.867,"No Your Honor, I don't suggest that and I don't disagree with what the attorney general said about that."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.867,2310.863,"Well, you implied in your statement that the foreman dictated what witnesses were going to be heard and that's not so at, all is it?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2310.863,2314.722,That is the matter of law but I think as a matter of just controlling --
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.722,2325.844,They are satisfied with what's presented to them but that's one thing but is not the prosecuting attorney some factor in what witnesses are going to be presented to a grand jury.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2325.844,2326.894,Well absolutely.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2326.894,2330.004,"He is the dominant factor, isn't he?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2330.004,2330.269,That is --
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2330.269,2333.11,Unless Tennessee is different from all the other states of the union.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2333.11,2350.187,"Tennessee is not different in that regard Your Honor, and I didn't mean to create an impression of -- but I wanted to impart the information that the foreman does occupy most important role."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2362.544,2363.847,Mr. Kurtz--
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2363.847,2364.145,Yes.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2364.145,2372.381,Coming back to the Stone v. Powell issue because I like to ask you some questions whenever it's appropriate.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2372.381,2375.729,"Yes Your Honor I will reach that, but of course I'd be glad to address it --"
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2375.729,2386.763,Now if you arguing another point but you mentioned Castaneda and some other cases a little while ago and I thought you are going to continue with the Stone v. Powell argument.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2389.188,2390.424,I will definitely get to it Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2390.424,2392.254,Alright.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2392.254,2410.153,I just -- further more the grand jury foreman must sign indictment in Tennessee or the indictment is void even if the Grand Jury foreman does not vote and of course the Grand Jury foreman has certain statutory duties even out of term.
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.231,2427.149,"But you say the Grand Jury foreman signed the indictment, the indictment need be returned by only 12 of the 13 Grand Jurors?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2427.149,2428.032,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.032,2435.549,"So if the foreman were the 13th and he disagreed with the action of that 12th, he would nonetheless be require to sign it, is that correct?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2435.549,2436.9,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2585.996,2598.336,"May we start out by my asking you, who was injured in this case by the foreman of the Grand Jury having been selected in a discriminatory manner?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2598.336,2600.729,I think the defendants.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2600.729,2603.111,How was he injured?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2603.111,2604.74,Both of them were injured Your Honor because --
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2604.74,2605.162,How were they?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2605.162,2608.868,Their personal Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2608.868,2611.057,"Well, in what respect?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2615.269,2616.554,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2616.554,2623.8,Is any error before us today in the trial that you are citing?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2623.8,2625.929,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2625.929,2632.864,So you stand here today challenging only the validity of the Grand Jury that indicted here.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2632.864,2634.771,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2634.771,2644.361,And again I ask you how was your client injured if he was tried and convicted by a jury properly selected?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2644.361,2654.967,"Well, again I must say because their personal Fourteenth Amendments rights were violated."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2654.967,2669.268,Were your clients rights violated in terms of judicial integrity as you use that term anymore than the public generally?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2669.268,2672.257,"Well, I think they were both violated Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2672.257,2681.697,"You concede your client had fair trial and he was found guilty, that guilt has been affirmed by at least three courts."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2681.697,2682.344,For purposes --
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2682.344,2684.037,You're not challenging that?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2684.037,2687.971,For purpose of this hearing I do not challenge that Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2687.971,2692.969,"And what is the purpose, the historical purpose of habeas corpus?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2692.969,2703.638,"Well, I believe the historical purpose of habeas corpus prior --"
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2703.638,2707.107,"It had something to do with innocence, didn't it?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2707.107,2709.276,"Yes Your Honor, it had something to do with innocence and --"
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2709.276,2714.083,Is innocence involved in this case at all?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2714.083,2716.218,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2716.218,2716.88,Alright.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2716.88,2730.64,But habeas corpus law has changed considerably since it had something to do with the innocence as you say and also it has to do with the jurisdiction of the Court.
1978.77-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.64,2738.627,Well habeas corpus has to do with release from unlawful confinement that may or may not have something to do with innocence in your case?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2738.627,2739.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2739.92,2743.075,It's released from unlawful confinement isn't it?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2743.075,2745.044,"Yes, and Congress is --"
1978.77-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2745.044,2747.773,"Sometime it has to do with the innocence, sometimes it doesn't."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2747.773,2749.231,Yes.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2749.231,2752.91,But is there any unlawful confinement in this case?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2752.91,2754.366,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2772.001,2775.274,The indictment.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2775.274,2777.196,"Well, there would be --"
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.196,2779.862,Which is the first case you rely upon?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2779.862,2783.317,I would start with Strauder versus West Virginia Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2783.317,2786.239,The attack that was on the petty jury as well as the Grand Jury.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2786.239,2787.035,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2787.035,2788.552,What was the next case?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2788.552,2795.271,"Bush versus Kentucky, which as an 1883 case, in which the attack was solely on the Grand Jury."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2795.271,2798.939,Was the issue you're arguing here today argued in that case?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2798.939,2803.432,"No, Your Honor but there is a case in which the issue that interests Your Honor was argued."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2803.432,2804.111,Which case was that?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2804.111,2807.517,And that is Cassell versus Texas.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2808.417,2810.206,Was that a habeas corpus case?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2810.206,2811.135,"No, it is not Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2811.135,2813.204,"Well, that's a very different case then."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2813.204,2817.143,The issue on habeas corpus has never been addressed by Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2817.143,2820.391,"Well, this is a novel case in that respect."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2820.391,2821.427,It is Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2821.427,2823.371,That's my point.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2823.371,2834.435,"But I would like to submit that there are tremendous differences in this case and Stone versus Powell, which should not lead to the same result."
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.071,2890.672,Your read Mr. Justice Stewart's opinions for the Court in Elkins against United States?
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2890.672,2891.719,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2891.719,2894.365,That came out a number of years ago.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2902.107,2921.502,"Yes, but as I read Stone versus Powell, Your Honor's have rejected such irrational in the area of the Fourth Amendment or if not rejecting it certainly entered into a balancing test, a balancing test that has never been used by this Court in Grand Jury discrimination cases."
1978.77-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2921.502,2936.573,"Well, that had to do with the exclusionary rule and it did as my brother Rehnquist correctly recollects, emphasize the interest of juridical integrity in connection with the exclusionary rule."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2936.573,2937.078,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2937.078,2941.939,"Which is, I would corollary to the Fourth Amendment."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2941.939,2952.936,"Well I certainly recognize that and support it, but I don't think that, that rationale is supported by this Court's decision in Stone versus Powell."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2952.936,2966.471,What did -- you said in response to question from Mr. Justice Stewart early that indictment can be only 12 votes of a Grand Jury and not by information as in some states.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,2966.471,2966.845,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2966.845,2998.995,"Suppose Tennessee law allowed a charge to be instituted in -- even on a homicide case by information from the prosecutor and it appeared the prosecutors for -- ever since Tennessee had been member of the union had been white males appointed by the governor since you don't want to get into the election process, by appointed by the governor."
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3010.877,3028.325,I think that that could raise substantial questions as to the validity of the charges if it was shown that the racial discrimination had been exercised in the selection of the prosecutors.
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3040.699,3045.154,First you try out the prosecutor before you can try the defendant.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3051.892,3053.05,That's possible.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3053.05,3054.418,Mr. Kurtz.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3054.418,3055.282,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3055.282,3076.087,"May I ask a question, obviously the integrity of the grand jury is important to society no one questions that, what other ways may the grand jury integrity be protected legally apart from the type of action that you have here today?"
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3076.087,3084.492,"Well of course the grand jury integrity could be protected by federal criminal statute, there is such statute 18 U.S. code 243."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3084.492,3085.057,That's right.

1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3092.141,3093.828,"Yes Your Honor, the Canyon case."
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3093.828,3099.662,Right and of course they can be direct attack on direct appeal.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3099.662,3100.856,In the state court.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3100.856,3104.297,In the state courts and this court also.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3104.297,3105.619,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1701,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3105.619,3111.249,So at least three other ways without resorting to habeas corpus.
1978.77-1701,1,45273,walter_c_kurtz,,3111.249,3133.652,"That's correct, there are alternatives available but I think that there are legitimate differences between the exclusionary rule and the rule in this case it does not appear that we are going to be able to get and my time is up now, thank you very much."
1978.77-1701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3133.652,3140.693,Do you have anything further Mr. Attorney General.
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3140.693,3144.11,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please court.
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.342,3233.111,"Mr. Attorney General, you are not suggesting this court to promulgate rules for the Tennessee courts to follow, are you?"
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3233.111,3253.885,"Oh no sir I said the state court, if the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee perceives that, this is a state wide system we have, and perceives that there have been numerous violations or its not working as a system because the --"
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3253.885,3262.934,What if as in this case where the Supreme Court of Tennessee perceived there was no problem and federal judges thought there was a problem.
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3265.168,3276.872,"That's the heart of the matter, yes sir I would say that as opposes the deterrent factor under which the rationale of federal habeas corpus has been used here for in Fourteenth Amendment question."
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3292.216,3303.594,"Well is it, it is generally considered a full fair and impartial hearing when the judge who's conduct in under review is the judge who is reviewing that conduct, which is what we had here."
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3308.62,3313.916,He was passing on the plea in abatement which went to the selection of the foreman juror --
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3313.916,3314.189,Which he had --
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3314.189,3316.568,"-- which would be his appointment, yes sir."
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3316.568,3325.637,Is that normally that a fair and adequate -- full and fair hearing of the issue when you have this -- the judge trying himself in effect?
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3325.637,3332.335,"Your Honor, he would be trying the issue presented to him as to whether or not there was, and he did submit --"
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3332.335,3340.72,"The challenge was that he had not followed a proper procedure, that was the challenge and then he is the one who decided whether or not he followed a proper procedure?"
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3340.72,3368.995,"Once much -- if Your Honor please once it might fall in the proper procedures so much it was the charge of being discriminating by intentionally and excluding black and I don't think that when his affidavit is read as a whole submitted into the record is what he said, simply said he seldom ever appointed people and when he did he simply reappointed those who had been there and then he had to consider."
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3368.995,3373.129,And then he reviewed his own affidavit and decided that that didn't show discrimination?
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3373.129,3387.316,Yes sir and then he also presided to go further as a trial judge for the petit jury but then that was reviewed by Criminal Court of Appeals in reviewing the entire record and the Supreme Court in reviewing the record.
1978.77-1701,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3387.316,3408.939,"But the issue as to full and fair trail as I have understood it didn't relate to whether or not foreman of the grand jury had been properly selected, the issue so far has habeas corpus being a proper remedy it relates to whether or not there was a full and fair trial of the defendant by the petit jury and the judge who presided over it."
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3408.939,3414.882,On the merits of the indictment --
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3414.882,3427.207,"Well that's a different test in the Stone against Powell test, on the Stone against Powell, the issue on the full and fair hearing isn't just a trial it's whether there was a hearing on the issue whether or not the evidence had been illegally seized, isn't that right?"
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3427.207,3428.76,Yes sir and I think it --
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3428.76,3434.51,"Is that what you are asking for or you are just saying whenever there is a fair trial that's the end of the matter, it's kind of an extension as Stone against Powell?"
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3434.51,3438.136,"No sir, I am not saying that at all."
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3448.893,3462.747,"Yeah, but in order for your theory of Stone against Powell to apply, we would have to decide if there was a full and fair hearing by the judge on the issue of discrimination in picking the grand jury foreman."
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3464.233,3480.961,I don't know maybe I missed it but I was under the impression that we were -- that our theory is that there was a full and fair hearing on every aspect of the -- in the accusatory spectrum including a full appellate review and post conviction --
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3480.961,3482.879,Well let's make it precise.
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3482.879,3483.554,-- as a system.
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3483.554,3493.288,If there was a not a full and fair hearing at the trial court level in the state system on the question whether the grand jury foreman had been picked improperly.
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3501.551,3506.433,"Yes sir it would be reviewable in the state court, if the state court felt that he, that --"
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3506.433,3510.939,"No, no, I say would it be reviewed on the federal court on that hypothesis?"
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3510.939,3517.552,"No sir under our, under our contention that that it should be expanded to include this as a --"
1978.77-1701,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3517.552,3526.977,And you would say Stone against Powell would bar it even if there was not a fair hearing by the State trial judge on the issue raised in the federal habeas corpus proceeding?
1978.77-1701,2,45380,william_m_leech,,3526.977,3532.602,Yes sir.
1978.77-1701,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3532.602,3533.245,Thank you gentlemen.
