1998.97-1056,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.936,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97 1056, Naomi Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild."
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,10.128,12.739,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.313,112.005,"Well, the contract was written in the language of the statute, I gather."
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,112.005,113.635,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.005,119.679,"And the statute doesn't make it all that clear itself, but I guess there's a judicial gloss on it."
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,119.679,121.041,"--That's my point, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.492,127.006,And why shouldn't the employee assume the judicial gloss is there?
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,129.547,132.578,"--To put it simply, Your Honor, the employee is not a lawyer."
1998.97-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.073,143.587,What other portions of the contract that are very intricate have to be spelled out for the employee?
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,152.223,153.044,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.044,154.523,"Well, where do we draw the line?"
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,154.523,175.209,"We draw the line at the union security clause, because that is the only provision of the contract as to which the interests of the individual employee are adverse, and as to which the union has a duty to inform employees truthfully and fully as to what their rights and obligations are."
1998.97-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.209,176.26,Well... go on.
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,191.121,196.412,"I don't believe so, Justice Souter, because the contract is the basic law of the shop."
1998.97-1056,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,196.412,222.86,"No, but the fact is, the employee is quite un... is far less likely to read the contract than to have contact with union representatives, who have, as you acknowledge, an obligation to explain, in fact, what those terms mean and what the employee's real obligation is, so it seems to me that you're arguing for a formality which the average employee is likely, unlikely even to take notice of."
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,222.86,225.572,"I don't believe that I'm arguing for a formality, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.221,241.894,What does that say with negotiating the contract?
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,287.195,289.057,"--There are two points to your question, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.81,338.171,"Well, Mr. LaJeunesse--"
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,338.171,339.763,"--go read the statute, and they'd still be misled."
1998.97-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.763,359.275,"--Suppose... suppose the contract had been written with all the complicated things you want in there, so that she would have had to come up with, what, $485 instead of $500 to join the union, she still wouldn't have gotten the job, because she didn't have the money."
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,361.517,377.798,"Well, she was injured because the casting agent in this case enforced the contract as it was written, saying, you are not going to work tomorrow if you don't pay the full amount demanded by the union by 5:00 this afternoon."
1998.97-1056,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.798,392.117,"Yes, the point is, I guess... you say the correct amount would have ben $485 instead of $500 and the contract could have made that clear, but she didn't have $485 either, so she still wouldn't have gotten the job."
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,395.99,398.101,"Well, there are two answers to that question, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.81,432.404,Regulatory lag would have saved her.
1998.97-1056,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,433.085,433.606,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1056,1,34516,leo_geffner,,1724.881,1730.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
