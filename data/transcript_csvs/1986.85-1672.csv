1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.013,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1672, United States against William D. Merchant."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,12.886,16.042,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.659,191.126,"You mean, this Court granted your petition, not the Court of Appeals?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,191.126,192.376,"--Oh, if I misspoke, I'm sorry."
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.002,230.814,Don't we have to get to the good faith ground anyway?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,242.904,248.526,"Well, the Court of Appeals analysis in that part of its opinion contained several different elements, we believe."
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.061,278.513,"Isn't that the end of the matter, though?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,285.621,289.073,"Well, the way the Court of Appeals seemed to address the case--"
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.073,290.635,Never mind how they did it.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,299.115,302.755,--And if the pretextual nature of the search was important to this case.
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.018,311.471,Okay.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,311.471,313.783,That deals with the substantive law of probation searches.
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.783,314.33,Right.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,314.33,317.751,And that's a question that the Court will address in the Griffin case.
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.653,335.229,"Mr. Larkin, what do you mean when you use the word ""pretextual""?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,335.229,344.819,"Well, the Court of Appeals seemed to be believing that the purpose of this search was not to enforce his probation, but was to conduct a criminal investigation of something else."
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.819,347.287,Are those totally distinct?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,347.287,349.865,"In our view, they shouldn't be."
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,420.475,428.989,"Mr. Larkin, do you think the pretext issue--"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,428.989,433.299,That it first knew of the order on February 27?
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,433.299,434.002,--Yes.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,434.002,439.358,I believe when he was told at the door was probably the first time.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,440.858,442.404,That was the first he knew about it?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,442.404,443.389,--Yes.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,445.606,446.98,"That doesn't give you any problem, does it?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,446.98,453.212,--It would give me a problem if they tried to revoke his probation for violating a condition of his probation.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,472.364,476.456,So he lost his rights without even knowing that he had lost them?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,476.456,478.127,"--No, I would disagree with that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,502.51,505.01,I'm not talking about when he was there.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,507.242,511.428,"--Well, he was not at the February 27 hearing, and he was not notified about it."
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,511.428,514.52,And he didn't know about that until they came to his door?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,514.52,515.49,Correct.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,516.317,520.566,And two minutes later they went to search him?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,520.566,521.847,--That's correct.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.826,542.639,0 xxx.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,542.639,542.92,That's right.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,546.591,550.184,"Well, we aren't interested in the California law as it... at least I'm not... apply to probation."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,554.916,562.727,"Well, at the time of the search in this case, Your Honor, and I will directly address now the good faith argument that we've made in our brief."
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,573.833,586.53,"But may I verify, Mr. Larkin, if we felt that the Court of Appeals was wrong on the notice rule that it made, we could reverse on that ground, and that would be the end of the matter?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,586.53,590.873,I believe technically speaking that would end the matter at this time.
1986.85-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.99,629.125,"Well, on the notice point, do you ask us to disagree with the Court of Appeals that under California law, the judge stayed the entire sentence rather than... stayed the entire judgment, rather than just a sentence?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,629.125,630.702,We do not ask the Court to disagree with that.
1986.85-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.667,655.712,"So that even if... even if this was an original sentencing hearing, notice to the attorneys is enough?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,655.712,658.038,It would be enough for the purpose of notice.
1986.85-1672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.038,659.07,"Yes, exactly."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,659.07,662.037,It may not be for the purpose of presence.
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.879,677.033,"Mr. Larkin, before you leave the notice aspect of the case, let's assume that you're dead right, that the order is not a nullity."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,714.659,715.081,That's right.
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.987,726.671,"Well, then, aren't you saying that the... that the... insofar as the conditions of the probation affect his personal conduct, he's entitled to notice of that before the order becomes effective as to him?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,738.355,747.32,"--Well, the order in this case, the February 27 order, was... dealt with a stay that had originally been imposed."
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.32,747.71,I understand.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,757.409,760.581,"No, I said he couldn't be... if the conditions--"
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.581,762.534,"Well, why couldn't you revoke it if it was effective?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,774.265,782.981,"--In our view, it would be effective for bringing into play the authorization that was contained in the November 14 sentencing order."
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.574,789.212,But why wouldn't it also be effective as to saying you can't associate with Mr. X?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,793.742,798.677,"--Because of the different things, the consequences, that flow from the order coming into being."
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.443,802.333,It's important to know about some but not others?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,807.19,811.75,"--Well, he's... it would be, I'm sure, important to him to know both of these."
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.467,821.483,"Well, he hasn't, because the man has consented to it, under your--"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,821.483,821.873,--That's right.
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.873,825.262,--But hasn't he also consented not to associate with Mr. X?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,825.262,833.306,"Well, I'm not sure I understand the difference, Your Honor, that you're... the point that you're making."
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.038,842.272,"Well, he's going to go to jail."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,842.272,843.397,--conducting a probation search.
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.397,845.834,Let's say he had private things there he didn't want the officers to see.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,851.787,861.081,That's the... it's not part of any type of affirmative disability that you're imposing on him for violating some type of condition that's been imposed on his liberty.
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.359,874.39,You don't think there are adverse consequences in an unwarranted search?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,874.39,876.608,"--Well, the adverse consequences in this case flowed--"
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.608,881.169,"I mean, just assuming he doesn't go to jail for it, just, you go into his living room when he doesn't expect anybody to walk in?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,884.918,898.693,"--Well, I think it's... maybe it's not a difference in... even if it's not a difference in kind, it's certainly at least a difference in degree between a probation officer just entering your home, and then a probation officer using the information against you to serve as the basis for revoking your probation and putting you in jail."
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.693,907.299,"I thought the point you were making, Mr. Larkin, was that you need notice for those matters that would affect your primary conduct."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,922.841,923.982,"No, I agree."
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.481,928.169,It isn't that you weren't taking it back.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,933.418,936.448,"--Well, that certainly is one of the distinctions."
1986.85-1672,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.072,945.29,"Well, and also, to what extent is the order effective."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,959.974,972.547,"--In our view, for the reasons that I've tried to explain, the fact that you're just entering is not sufficiently comparable to the fact that you are ultimately put in prison, to say that the entry is itself a type of penalty of which you need some type of notice."
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.547,976.764,"Mr. Larkin, I'm getting confused by this discussion."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,995.18,996.695,"That's our position, Your Honor, yes."
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.695,999.678,"Well, and the record seems to support that."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1052.533,1057.889,If there is no procedural flaw in the February 27 hearing--
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1057.889,1058.42,Right.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1058.42,1061.919,"--either of notice or presence, the order in our view would be valid."
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.919,1062.419,Right.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1062.419,1072.572,"Respondent has challenged, in the lower courts but not in this court, that order to the consent to search provision entered at the original proceeding on the ground that that's substantively invalid."
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.963,1074.869,But that's not before us at all?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1074.869,1076.024,"--in this case; no, that's correct."
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.5,1114.384,"But I think Justice O'Connor's question is, if you... or at least that's the way I understood it... if you find that the consent to search provision and the probation decree has no flaw in it, you don't need to get to any good faith exceptions."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1114.384,1122.163,--You could end the case at this time simply by ruling on the notice and/or the presence grounds.
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.163,1122.257,Yes.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1122.257,1124.178,This Court would not need to go further than that.
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.865,1138.488,"Well, if we say this was a valid search, I would think the Court of Appeals would have difficulty saying it was an invalid search after our opinion."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1138.488,1144.642,"No, by that what I mean, Your Honor, is, respondent has an issue that he raised in the Court of Appeals that he's not reasserted here."
1986.85-1672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.062,1156.294,"Well, if we decided it wasn't, I doubt that the Court of Appeals would contradict us."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1156.294,1157.685,I fully agree.
1986.85-1672,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.582,1181.238,And that's coming up in another case this term.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1181.238,1181.691,Correct.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.161,1415.863,"Mr. Larkin, there weren't just police there."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1417.862,1418.612,"Correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1418.612,1422.017,So I mean they weren't without legal advice?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1422.017,1422.689,That's true.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1424.656,1426.938,Who knew the facts of the case.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1426.938,1428.094,That's correct.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1428.094,1433.125,And who knew that the respondent was not in court.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1433.125,1434.483,That's correct.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1451.553,1455.911,xxx objects to the legality of the hearing.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1462.362,1464.251,"Well, I think he also objects to the--"
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1464.251,1468.827,"If he had been at the hearing, he would have no case at all, right?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1468.827,1470.435,--I believe so.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1470.435,1474.56,"But if he wasn't at the hearing, that doesn't help him at all, you say?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1474.56,1475.684,No.
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.684,1477.027,"Well, why should he be there?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1477.027,1483.135,"Well, it's a purely legal hearing on a stay; the same type of hearing that could take place in an appellate court."
1986.85-1672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1489.288,1492.302,0 xxx.
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1492.302,1493.099,Well--
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.099,1499.191,"Mr. Larkin, wasn't it that the effect of the second hearing was to confer his agreement?"
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1509.016,1517.06,"--Yes, it's our view that the record and the state law makes it clear that he consented at the time the order was originally entered November 14."
1986.85-1672,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.089,1534.399,"What if I agree with you that notice was not necessary so long as the attorney was advised, but I think he should have had a right to be present at the second hearing."
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1537.522,1543.957,The next question then is whether the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that the order entered was valid and therefore authorized the search.
1986.85-1672,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1545.566,1549.346,May I just ask this final question?
1986.85-1672,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1578.584,1587.097,"I agree, Your Honor, that the Court of Appeals said that the November 14 order was stayed in its entirety."
