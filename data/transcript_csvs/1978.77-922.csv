1978.77-922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.774,"We’ll hear arguments next in 922, Chrysler Corporation against Brown."
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,50.641,54.445,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.188,332.81,"When you say the Trade Secrets Act counselor, you mean 18 U.S.C. 1905?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,332.81,333.605,Yes sir.
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.605,340.528,Isn’t one of the black letter principles of equity that court of equity will not enjoin a criminal act?
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,340.528,341.471,That is correct.
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.28,367.043,Well you’re stating then it just didn’t bothered to follow what is on the black letter principle of equity?
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,367.043,369.309,I believe it did bother to follow.
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,691.109,694.567,Which legislative history are you talking about Senate or the House?
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,694.567,698.62,This comes through in fact in both the Senate and the House.
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.912,731.93,This is committee report?
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,731.93,733.942,These are in the committee reports.
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.508,770.251,"I always had the feeling that one with a House Report was written by the proponents and the Senate report was written by the opponents or vice versa, I find those reports quite contradicting?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,770.251,775.508,They obviously have their proponents and their opponents.
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.444,821.511,"Mr. Braverman I wonder if your argument really advances your cause because the statutory language is the same as in -- for in terms of whether it’s permissive or mandatory for all six exemption, through 7 exemptions rather."
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,829.728,830.8,"No, I don’t believe so."
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.131,909.883,"Exemption 4 was added later, how do you explain the failure to use different language?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,909.883,915.599,Exemption 4 was added in response to the need to protect the information.
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,932.184,941.636,"But it doesn’t really explain why they used statutory language, that had previously been made clear to have a permissive meaning, to accomplish the purpose you describe."
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,942.546,954.072,"I think it’s poor legislative drafting because I think that they meant something more than merely shall not apply, and what has to be done is to be read in the context of what proceeded this."
1978.77-922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1057.385,1075.832,"Was there anything in the legislative history discussing the organization of business groups, who simply sort information in the abstract then classified it and sold it too, was that developed in the legislative history?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1075.832,1079.358,I do not recall anything concerning that in the legislative?
1978.77-922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.358,1084.34,"-- parts, I wondered whether it was in this history?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1084.34,1085.542,I do not recall that.
1978.77-922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.052,1117.86,"But it’s true that Congress moved it, is piloting for the lack of another word, between business corporation was going on."
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1119.602,1127.619,In ‘67 they knew that this was a practice that was then conducted by sequestering an employee taking a photograph.
1978.77-922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1128.8,1130.186,Anyway possible.
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1130.186,1133.283,"Anyway, but they did not realize that the act –"
1978.77-922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1133.283,1135.679,They didn’t realize that this was going to be a new way?
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1135.679,1140.912,They didn’t realize it because they intended that the fourth exemption would provide protection.
1978.77-922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1141.398,1144.391,I don't think it is a clear as you think it is.
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1147.351,1150.6,"Perhaps they should have more foresight, we wish they had."
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.044,1205.306,You know Congress did provide some protection for the kind of thing you talk about.
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1218.01,1226.568,"Absolutely that is in fact another issue in the case which I was not going to address today, but I will say that we do contend although the-"
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1226.568,1227.763,That’s Exemption 3 --
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1227.763,1242.094,"-the court did not agree, that’s right that Exemption 3 incorporates the Trade Secrets Act into the FOIA in such a way as to make the act not applicable to any information which falls within the Trade Secrets Act and that is an issue."
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1242.094,1248.715,"I’m sure that it’s your view that Exemption 3 is more than just permissive to, as you submit -"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1248.715,1251.951,"Exemption 3 is absolutely mandatory, yes."
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.462,1264.644,"And that neither under -- if material falls under either Exemption 3 or Exemption 4, the agency may not waive for Exemption?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1264.644,1266.388,That is correct.
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1269.669,1275.666,"Although you can see, the agencies may waive the other or at least some of the other exemptions?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1275.666,1279.754,Exactly because those exemptions are designed to protect governmental interests.
1978.77-922,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.754,1288.469,Now is this because of the legislative history or because of the interest that are designed to protect or because of their language or what?
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1288.469,1299.19,"It is because of the interests that they are designed to protect, it is because of the history of Section 1905 the Trade Secrets Act there’s a quote as incorporated through Exemption 3."
1978.77-922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.021,1313.106,"Mr. Braverman, I am puzzled by your reliance on 3, because the condition of coming within 3 is it some other statute mandate non-disclosure?"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1313.106,1313.935,That’s right and in this --
1978.77-922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.935,1318.279,"So then how can 3 be the source of the mandate for non-disclosure, you don’t even --"
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1318.279,1321.759,It’s a somewhat circular process.
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.679,1513.798,"Before the enactment of FOIA Mr. Braverman, I take it if you had been defending Chrysler against a private litigant in the United States District Court that private litigant would have been free to go to the Department of Defense and say, “look we got a law suit, will you give us some papers that you’ve got here?” And the Department of Defense could have given it to them without the necessity of going through the compliance of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1516.382,1523.274,"That’s not true, because at that point the Department of Defense would have been prohibited by the Trade Secrets Act from disclosing that to any person."
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.274,1525.214,"But if you are right, they still are."
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1525.214,1527.151,If we are right and if the Trade Secrets Act—
1978.77-922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.151,1530.226,And in each case the remedy would be a criminal prosecution.
1978.77-922,0,17430,burt_braverman,,1530.226,1538.79,Exactly.
1978.77-922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.79,1540.452,Mrs. Babcock?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1540.452,1543.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1630.108,1634.037,"Mrs. Babcock, isn’t it true that in -- we are not to confront the abuse of discretion issue here, are we?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1638.126,1651.672,"Yes it is, but I think that here this Court should take the approach - should mandate the approach in this kind of case, which we have all fallen into the habit of calling reverse Freedom of Information Act cases."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1662.538,1663.844,"Well, that’s the issue, isn’t?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1663.844,1665.044,It is the issue and --
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1665.044,1671.841,Since you’re making argument on merits because we don’t begin with that as a hypothesis agreed to by both sides.[Laughter].
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1671.841,1696.632,"Oh no, it’s certainly not agreed to by both sides, but that is the point that I am making here, which is that these very kinds of issues which is the balancing of the public and - the public interest in knowing and the private interest in concealing- these have risen before to this Court in other context, and there is nothing about the Freedom of Information Act that changes that-"
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.632,1697.169,Of course in the Schreiber --
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.169,1699.198,"Excuse me, go ahead."
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.198,1707.396,"In the Schreiber case it was an agency proceeding, the agency was really an interested party in conducting those hearings, was it not?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1713.239,1724.59,"Not at all Your Honor, I think that’s a very important point, the agency is not a disinterested bystander; we have to look at what the records that are complied here are."
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1765.035,1770.906,Does the government need to disclose it to the world at large in order to a make use of it for governmental purposes?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1770.906,1789.801,"No it doesn’t need to disclose it to the world at large, except this particular kind of information which is Equal Employment Opportunity Information has been found under the Regulations of the Labor Department and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance to be useful for disclosure."
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.983,1814.89,Why does it have more of an interest in that area than in any number of other areas where the Department of Defense receives information?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1814.89,1817.25,Why does the agency have more interest?
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.25,1834.471,"Well, why does the agency conclude that the public has more information in the equal employment operations of the Department of Defense say then in the procurement regulations or the personnel policies of the veterans’ preference or something else?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1834.471,1855.991,It doesn’t conclude that it has more of an interest Mr. Justice Rehnquist but it does say that peculiarly there is a current interest in the enforcement of the executive order and that the -- but it is not -- but there may be a equal interest in procurement or any of those other matters.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.435,1902.729,I don’t see how any of that has any relevance if the information is in fact trade secret and confidential.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1902.729,1903.408,Yes they are.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.408,1906.084,"The fact it has been asked for, does not make any difference than census information or anything else, doesn’t it?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1906.084,1909.061,Well Mr. Justice Stevens that’s what I was just going to reach.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.161,1961.008,"Well, I suppose it depends on which point of view you look at it from but do we not start with the assumption that some of this information is confidential or trade secret information within the meaning of Exemption 4?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1961.008,1963.735,"Well, we can’t start -- we can’t really start with that."
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.7,1971.954,The District Court so found in this case?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,1971.954,1974.309,"The District Court so found, yes."
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1987.602,2005.71,"Well, but doing nothing because— to be sure I have your position well in mind, you do take the position, the United States takes a position and even if Exemption 4 applies and even if the information is a trade secret, a bonafide genuine trade secret, they may nevertheless in their discretion decide to disclose it."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2005.71,2022.584,"Yes sir, under certain regulations though and that is if the disclosure is in the public interest and if the disclosure would not harm the agencies’ ability to gather information or to do its job in the future so that they aren’t --"
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2022.584,2025.56,Even though it would harm the proponent of the information?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2025.56,2045.904,"Even though it is confidential commercial information, it is -- what we are talking about here under these regulations is a balancing, and the balancing has to be the harm to the submitter of the information and the benefit to the public, and the need for the public in the interest of the Freedom of Information Act."
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2045.904,2054.82,Did the Court of Appeals find that there was no substantial evidence to support the findings made by the District Court?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2073.143,2080.257,"No, Mr. Justice Powell in essence the Third Circuit just kind of leaped over the District Court opinion."
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2088.259,2095.25,"But for purposes of deciding this case, do you think we must accept those findings by the District Court?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2095.25,2098.456,"No, Your Honor, I don’t because what I would ask --"
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2098.456,2100.322,What do we do with them?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2100.322,2105.539,What you do with them is affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2105.539,2106.008,I understand.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2106.008,2127.492,-- which sort of skipped over the findings of the District Court [Laughter] and said that the case should go back to the agency for a further record and mandated the creation of the kind of record which would allow a District Court to review these kinds of cases under the Administrative Procedure Act.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2127.492,2128.543,May I ask you this?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2144.591,2145.505,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2145.505,2149.38,"Yes, well next question is this."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2178.057,2186.93,"No that would not be appropriate because the agency has a function here and the agency -- and we really, I don’t think can down play this."
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2199.338,2200.613,Because the records show --
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2200.613,2204.756,It has an interest in doing an appropriate balance and it has the expertise.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2204.756,2214.328,Does the record in this case show what interest an agency has in making this information available to competitors of Chrysler?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2214.328,2223.231,No it does not and I think it should be made very clear that the requestors in this case are not competitors of Chrysler and in fact in the vast majority --
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2223.231,2224.303,They could be.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2225.966,2237.967,"Any of them -- there is no distinction made among the requestors but if we look at the real world and what’s really happening in the so called reverse Freedom of Information Act cases, the requestors are not the competitors."
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2251.506,2259.493,"Would the information be denied if one showed up and said, I represent General Motors and I would like to have this information?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2259.493,2280.039,That’s -- no it wouldn’t except that in the balancing that the agency does and in the administrative record that the agency would make though the-- it would certainly I think be taken into account when you weigh the interest of Chrysler in withholding the information who the requestor was.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.039,2286.684,"But if -- General Motors was denied, they just asked their friendly newspaper to go get it for them."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2286.684,2295.093,That’s certainly true and that’s why the act -- I mean that’s one of the problems of the Freedom of Information Act that there is no way to distinguish among requestors but I --
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.093,2306.24,"This includes a group of people who might organize a corporation as industrial intelligence incorporated gather the information, classify it and then sell it to the people who are interested."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2306.24,2317.888,That is happening and that is certainly a distressing aspect of the Freedom of Information Act but that is not -- it doesn’t have anything to do with this case and I think --
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.888,2329.66,What should we do if we disagree with you or with the agency that if this is within Exemption 4 namely really a trade secret that the agency may not release it.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2335.132,2341.454,"Your Honor, you don’t have a record here, which would allow you to find that this is information that-"
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2341.454,2342.621,I didn’t ask that.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2366.772,2366.967,What you would have to do --
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.967,2369.252,Are there any circumstances they may not release them?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2369.252,2375.31,What you would have to do as a legal matter Your Honor is to find that Exemption 4 is mandatory.
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2377.536,2380.601,"Well suppose we do, what do we need to --?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2380.601,2384.105,"If you do, I would submit you’ve made an incorrect legal procedure."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2384.105,2385.923,I understand that.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2394.773,2398.365,"If you find that Exemption 4 is mandatory, we certainly lose our case."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2398.365,2420.705,"And what if we or what if we found that 1905 prevented the agency from-- even if exemption 4 was permissive, Exemption 3 invokes 1905 and that the agency may not release the materials under 1905."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2420.705,2439.852,"Well 1905 -- you don’t -- if you find that 1905 applies here and that these materials should have been withheld under 1905, then you don’t need to reach the point of whether it is an Exemption 3, whether 1905 is an Exemption 3 statute."
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.852,2448.967,"If 1905 -- if agency is held a hearing and decided that the material should be released, 1905 by definition does not apply."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2452.137,2456.605,If the agency has held a hearing and decided that the material should be released --
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.605,2468.92,When 1905 by definition does not prohibit its release since it’s been -- if is an agency regulation will bring it within the as-authorized by law clause of 1905.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2468.92,2470.336,Absolutely and --
1978.77-922,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2470.336,2471.843,"If -- but that’s a big “if”, and you didn’t --"
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2471.843,2473.886,Rather large “if.”
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2473.886,2478.317,Well the “if” being if the agency has held a hearing Your Honor or --?
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.317,2481.173,If an agency regulation is a law?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2481.173,2481.762,If the agency --
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.762,2483.291,Within the meaning of 1905.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2483.291,2506.082,"Exactly and that is one of the issues in this case, and yet I would draw your attention to this Court’s opinion in Player versus Osterlind (ph) in which there was a subpoena from the board of tax appeals to the commissioner of Internal Revenue for the tax returns of twelve corporations."
1978.77-922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.428,2608.88,But the regulation have to be adopted after notice and chance for comment or wouldn’t just an ordinary house keeping regulation be sufficient?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2608.88,2611.885,The regulations must be valid Your Honor and so --
1978.77-922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.885,2619.531,"They must be valid, but must they be the kind that are adopted after a notice and after public notice?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2619.531,2623.036,I think it would depend on the circumstances of the case.
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2643.471,2663.467,Is it open to a district judge confronted with this problem to hold that the discretion under Exemption 4 has been abused in granting disclosures?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2667.042,2670.198,Yes I think that -- Yes under the --
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.198,2682.273,"Can a district judge say, well yes they had discretion but here on the record made before me, the discretion has been abused. And therefore I deny disclosure."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2682.273,2695.153,"That -- under the standard of review that we’re arguing, under the Administrative Procedure Act, it would be open to the District Court to say that the agency committed a clear error of judgment."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.226,2844.486,"Well then your argument would -- that view of the statute would lead to the conclusion that with respect to material covered by the exemptions, one just disregards the Freedom of Information Act, correct?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2844.486,2844.826,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2844.826,2852.996,"With respect to that -- anything covered by the nine exemptions, one just pretends the Freedom of Information Act had never been enacted and that’s a result of your argument?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2852.996,2860.89,"In a sense, I mean the analysis would be that, does the information fall within an exemption."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2860.89,2864.541,"If so forget the Freedom of Information Act, isn’t that right?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2865.215,2873.294,"That’s correct Your Honor and if it does, the act does not apply and then the agency may decide --"
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2873.294,2876.677,"Well, subject to 1905 and may be other laws?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2876.677,2884.493,"Subject to non-disclosure statutes, subject to the public interest and disclosures and the agencies often decide to withhold on the basis of one of the exemptions."
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2884.493,2896.608,"Yeah, but the agency may or may not have discretion but whether or not it does is to be determined by laws other than the Freedom of Information Act?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2896.608,2897.566,That’s exactly right Your Honor.
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2897.566,2898.542,"That’s what follows your argument, isn’t it?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2898.542,2900.441,That is my argument.
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.441,2915.27,"But General Babcock, I thought you had said perhaps I misunderstood you that in their hearing that the agency would conduct that the Exemption 4 would have to be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not to release."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2915.27,2921.145,It would be taken -- in practical terms it would be taken into account in the balancing that is --
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.145,2924.703,But how is that consistent with your answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2924.703,2938.529,"It is that -- as a matter of statutory construction, once it is decided that material falls within the act, then the act does not -- it falls within one of the exemptions, then the act does not apply."
1978.77-922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.232,2975.718,I don't understand this.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2984.248,2987.427,No Mr. Justice Marshall that is not true.
1978.77-922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.427,2990.361,On what authority would the agency release it?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,2990.361,2996.374,The agency -- if it falls within Exemption 4 then the act does not apply.
1978.77-922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.546,3004.369,On what authority does the agency have to release my private property?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3004.369,3009.897,The agency may release your property if it is in the public interest to do so.
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3009.897,3019.861,"Well, the agency first of all your answer must be the agency has whatever power it may have or had or may have not had without any consideration under Freedom of Information Act?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3019.861,3021.442,Exactly Your Honor.
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.442,3024.761,And your claim is that power includes agency discretion and that’s the question?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3024.761,3027.606,Of course it does and it has since 1789 when --
1978.77-922,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3027.606,3029.759,"Of course, that’s your contention?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3029.759,3032.837,Yes and I continue to make it.
1978.77-922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.837,3036.582,1789 they didn’t release it.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3036.582,3043.114,They didn’t and certainly I’m not saying -- this is a tool of analysis in terms of reading the statute.
1978.77-922,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3073.433,3077.492,"Whereas when the act does apply, it must be released?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3077.492,3081.088,"That’s exactly right, that is the point."
1978.77-922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.088,3096.351,Could a District Court reverse the agency under the APA Abuse of Discretion standard when the agency had decided to release the information if the District Courts felt that it should have applied Exemption 4 and not released it?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3096.351,3116.505,"If the agency had so far misread and the remand in this case seems to take that into account, if the agency had so far misread Exemption 4 that it was a clear error in judgment, so as to be an abuse of discretion or to be contrary to law then the District Court could."
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3118.963,3130.606,Is there a large amount of information Mrs. Babcock that government has in its files which is supplied voluntarily by many different industries in the country?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3130.606,3133.572,"It depends on what you mean by voluntary Mr. Chief Justice, I mean --"
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3133.572,3138.89,"Well, if they are not required to furnish it, they furnish it or do not furnish it, of their own choice."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3138.89,3146.978,"They furnish it because of their interest in getting government contracts and getting the government on their side, persuading the government to do what they wanted to do."
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.978,3158.387,"Well the Forest Service for example, asks for and receives a lot of information which the suppliers need not to give to them if they don’t want to."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3181.052,3183.63,It could be.
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.281,3190.935,On its face it’s subject to the Act whether it falls under an --
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3190.935,3191.582,Certainly.
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.582,3194.458,-- exemption is a second inquiry.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3210.765,3219.333,Certainly and it actually in these regulations that we’re concerned with in this case that is one of the considerations that the agency applies.
1978.77-922,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3219.333,3221.832,It doesn’t have that discretion if the Act is applicable?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3221.832,3223.264,Oh if the Act is applicable-
1978.77-922,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3223.264,3224.385,They must release --
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3224.385,3231.733,"If the Act is applicable, it must release, but if it falls with an exemption and not as assuming, yes."
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3231.733,3237.152,"Then if their discretion comes into play that is a factor to weigh, is it?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3237.152,3242.138,"Yes, and it’s a factor that it’s built into the regulations in this case."
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3242.138,3252.109,"Madam Attorney General, who in fact made the decision in this case that this material should be released in the public interest?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3252.109,3261.175,The record in the - some functionaries in the Office of Federal Contract Compliance made the decision.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3267.971,3283.277,"Right, but what troubles me is normally if someone’s rights are affected even in the bureaucracy you can identity who has made a decision and can perhaps have a chance talk to him or her?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3283.277,3305.87,"And that’s exactly what the effect of this opinion would be that the remand in this case, and if this Court would mandate this as a proper procedure, is for the agency to make a proper record on whether the materials falls into Exemption 4 and then why they have found it is in the public interest for it to be a released?"
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3305.87,3312.082,"A decision was made initially without any record I take it, that’s why the case is here."
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3312.082,3316.007,The decision -- the record is inadequate.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3316.007,3326.42,In a written guidelines or standards as to what elements ought to be considered in making a judgment as to what is or is not in the public interest?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3326.42,3332.458,There are not any in the actual regulations that we have it at issue here.
1978.77-922,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3345.115,3352.222,"Absence of something like that, the discretion would be virtually limitless, wouldn’t it?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3352.222,3368.493,If it were virtually limitless that would be subject to attack I think under the APA as being beyond the agency's discretion that it shouldn’t be virtually limitless there are regulations.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.486,3374.606,What is the provision for a delay in the release of the information during the administrative procedure?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3382.385,3384.559,The problem can be handled in a number of ways.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.98,3398.138,"It can’t be, but must there be?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3400.672,3401.286,I think they would probably --
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.286,3409.74,"Is it still possible the agency can say, well we did objections but we’re going to go ahead and release it, we’ll have our hearings later?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3409.74,3424.76,If the procedure set out here for review for submitters under the APA were followed then the agency would have every interest in getting the submitter’s view and having an adequate record.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3424.76,3427.102,"They have got the view, and the view is, “Please don’t release it.”"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3428.76,3432.801,"They can still release it certainly, but the submitter can go to court --"
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.801,3439.942,"In another words if you have the same thing given all over again under the APA procedure that we had in this case, but just with a little better record, is that --"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3439.942,3441.831,But that’s a big difference.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.557,3446.592,What if they say it will take 15 days to have the hearing or something like that?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3448.701,3459.871,"No, they wouldn’t release it in the meantime because the submitter is going to go to court and get as they have in all of these cases and get a preliminary injunction against their releasing it."
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.344,3469.086,What I’m trying to find out is there a duty under the administrative procedure to withhold release until there has been a reasoned decision by the agency?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3469.086,3474.131,"There isn’t any duty, but it has never happened that the agency has done that."
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3474.319,3475.868,It happened in this case.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3476.647,3477.733,It hasn’t.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3479.444,3481.653,But they said they were going to within five days?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3481.653,3482.438,But they didn’t do it.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3482.438,3487.809,They only didn’t do it because they went to court and now the Third Circuit said we have no business in court.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3505.556,3512.652,"I understand Mr. Justice Stevens where the -– where our problem is, or my problem which is I don’t mean before the APA."
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3530.619,3537.496,My question is what guarantee do they have that the information will not be released while they are trying to make a record?
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3537.496,3540.433,They have the ability to go to court-
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3540.433,3540.854,I see.
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3540.854,3541.639,-- to stop it from being released.
1978.77-922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.639,3546.245,"It's saying with the wrong procedure, well they do, you concede they have right to go to court?"
1978.77-922,1,17450,barbara_b_babcock,,3546.245,3563.895,"Yes, absolutely and the only thing that we are concerned with is the standard of review and the statute under which it’s reviewed and they would still have that same right and in fact they have exercised it freely."
1978.77-922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3617.421,3619.968,You have anything in further Mr. Braverman?
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3619.968,3620.9,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3620.9,3622.266,Very well.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3622.266,3626.966,This is something of a case where the pendulum has swung a bit too far.
1978.77-922,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3699.126,3702.223,"You wouldn’t mind if you get a record on that, do you?"
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3702.223,3706.781,The problem is that there cannot be an adequate record in these cases.
1978.77-922,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3755.963,3758.496,So the courts have the time?
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3758.496,3759.818,"The courts, the courts --"
1978.77-922,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3759.818,3762.355,"We always have the time, nobody else has it?"
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3762.355,3790.749,"The difference is, is that the court is not subject to the 10-day limitation that is found in the FOIA and the agencies are and it is simply impossible for an agency employee who has no expertise in the question of determining competitive injury to get in some cases 1000s of pages of documents in front of him and to try to make a judgment in a matter of days and also to assume that the Company itself can make the kind of showing necessary in this case."
1978.77-922,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3840.451,3847.403,Suppose under the -- without the Freedom of Information Act before it was even passed 1905 is on the books.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3858.806,3864.966,If regulations would qualify then perhaps those regulations could disarm the Trade Secret Law.
1978.77-922,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3866.96,3872.976,"Yes, unless suppose that and then comes the Freedom of Information Act."
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3884.914,3888.581,The express affirmation in the legislative history.
1978.77-922,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3888.581,3889.401,Yes or no.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3889.401,3891.712,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-922,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3891.712,3904.516,"So that, what was purported to be on the part of Congress an Act setting a floor under disclosure by the agency in your view set a ceiling and at least once."
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3904.516,3906.966,It continued to recognize practice.
1978.77-922,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3906.966,3917.135,What was Justice White’s question was that did the Freedom of Information Act change the previous practice.
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3917.135,3923.541,It locked up -- did the Freedom of Information Act lock up something that was available before or not?
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3923.541,3925.091,The information as a practice.
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3925.091,3925.503,You said it is.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3925.503,3926.672,It was not available.
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.672,3926.826,You said it is.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3926.826,3930.222,I was not available and it provided mandatory protection for it.
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3930.222,3931.124,No.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3943.869,3945.111,"If there were regulations, yes."
1978.77-922,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3945.111,3952.682,All right then comes the Freedom of Information Act and you say that what was previously available is now unavailable.
1978.77-922,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3952.682,3955.141,Because of Exemption 4 and its legislative.
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3955.141,3956.314,That’s my advice to your submission.
1978.77-922,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3956.314,3957.638,I’m sure that’s your submission.
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3957.638,3959.422,That is it.
1978.77-922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3959.422,3976.05,"What is that you don’t agree -- my consideration to the Congress that FOIA was an effort to have some harmony and the uniformity and among that dozens and dozens of agencies about disclosure, was that a factor?"
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,3976.05,3990.188,"Certainly it was intention to eliminate the public interest standard that was unevenly applied by agencies by eliminating the public interest standard and by putting in a legislative standard that Congress set and not the agencies, yes--"
1978.77-922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3990.188,4000.222,Would you say that it’s still unevenly applied because each agency has a different view of the exemptions do I understand that?
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,4000.222,4007.683,"A different view perhaps and also differing amounts of expertise, different perceptions of what -- what the public interest should be."
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4024.083,4032.837,"I’m quite aware of that -- I’m quite aware of that, but your submission is that even if it did the Freedom of Information Act changed the rule."
1978.77-922,2,17430,burt_braverman,,4032.837,4035.292,It would have to be read as a later legislative statement.
1978.77-922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4035.292,4037.439,Yes.
1978.77-922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4037.439,4039.013,Thank you counsel.
