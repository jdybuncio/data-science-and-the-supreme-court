1965.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,0.0,24.433,"Number 280, Pasquale J. Accardi and others against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company."
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1570.12,1576.269,"Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court."
1965.280,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1839.161,1846.796,You mean that there was an explicit exclusion of people in the category of these petitioners?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1846.796,1850.349,"I do not mean there was an explicit exclusion, sir."
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1871.177,1882.302,"Mr. Butler, does that definition appear on the record?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1883.977,1886.717,The agreement is in the record in full --
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1886.717,1886.98,Yes --
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1886.98,1887.01,Mr. Justice Brennan.
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1887.01,1902.372,-- I just wondered whether the -- you could refer me to the definition itself of compensated service.
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1902.372,1907.293,I don't believe there is any specific definition of compensated service as such.
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1907.293,1908.666,Oh I see.
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1908.666,1923.125,"Except that in the note on page 10 underneath the column or tabulation, the agreement states, a month of compensated service is any month and which the employee worked one or more days."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.339,1949.576,"Of course the Government's position, as I understood Mr. Posner, is that you can argue this case even though there was a specific and expressed attempt to exclude this category of the person."
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1960.805,1971.011,I think that is the Government's position Mr. Justice White and we think it's an entirely unjustified position and that there is nothing in Section 8 (c) or the Selective Service Act that requires this.
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.011,1972.979,You think Tilton controls that question?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1972.979,1973.507,Sir?
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.507,1976.165,You think Tilton controls that question?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1976.165,1976.403,No.
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.403,1981.984,"In Tilton, at least, the petitioners came back there and completed the work."
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1981.984,1982.757,"That is right, sir."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.757,1988.454,They came back to have completed their service as in the credit and then their seniority was dated back.
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,1988.454,2000.313,"I don't think Tilton controls it, because Tilton involved the question of seniority and what privileges were to pertain to seniority."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.313,2008.176,But there was the question of an advancing from an apprentice to a permanent position and you had to do those for a certain period of apprenticeship before you became permanent.
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2008.176,2009.216,"That is right, sir."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.216,2012.432,"And then when they came back to service, they should leave the apprenticeship."
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2012.432,2014.541,"That is right, sir."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.541,2018.026,From what date did their permanent status --
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2018.026,2021.446,This Court held that it had to be dated back.
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.378,2029.816,"But that case didn't hold that if they hadn't have done the work, they were entitled to a permanent --"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2029.816,2030.987,By no means.
1965.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2124.664,2136.078,I presume you're saying that he had been on the furlough for six months or gone six months leave of absence that they couldn't have their pay?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2136.078,2137.486,"That is right sir, and that is the --"
1965.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2137.486,2140.159,(Inaudible)
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2140.159,2141.72,"That is right, sir."
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2149.964,2152.799,"That's your 8 (c) argument, isn't it, Mr. Butler?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2152.799,2158.311,"Well, this is -- my argument is that 8 (c) doesn't control this case."
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2269.9,2293.947,"I suppose then, Mr. Butler, if you had a vacation pay program under a collective bargaining agreement that said, four weeks vacation pay after 20 years of compensated service, three with vacation pay after 17 years of compensated service, and they have this provision you pointed to at page 10, you'd say the party got only three weeks and not four, isn't it?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2293.947,2295.253,"I would, yes."
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2371.772,2390.859,I wonder -- suppose here is any basis for the assumption -- presumption call it if you will that but-for the three years he spent in service Accardi would have worked at least one day a month?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2390.859,2391.034,I think --
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2391.034,2393.135,In the years 1940 to 1943?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2393.135,2400.694,"I think the Court can well assume that he would have, but I don't think that's dispositive of this case."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.003,2427.352,"Well, what if the agreement based vacation or the severance pay on the length of seniority --"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2427.352,2431.198,Then we would've computed seniority by giving him credit for the military service.
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.198,2444.614,"And that would -- anything -- anything that is computable just by reference to the passage of time or that's automatic in the passage of time he would've got credit for it, wouldn't it?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2444.614,2446.647,He would have because the agreement would have given it to him.
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.647,2450.953,And you think the one day a month really takes it out to that category?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2450.953,2455.463,"I don't think the one day a month affects it one way the other, Mr. Justice White."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.381,2473.006,Why if could -- do think the parties could have agreed for example that there well be severance pay based on length of seniority but excluding credit for a military veterans?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2473.006,2475.034,"No, I do not, because that would be discriminating against veterans."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.034,2481.492,If the duty is to dispositive of the case doesn't say the parties agreed on it or that it was in the heat of a labor conflict?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2481.492,2490.715,"I will modify that by saying, it's dispositive of the case if the agreement is without taint of hostility toward veterans, if it doesn't discriminate against veterans."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.715,2500.057,"Well, I'm just asking you again then that you think the one day a month thing is so significantly different from just basing it on seniority which is automatic in the passage of time?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2500.057,2501.292,"No, I do not."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.077,2503.92,You think it's not significantly different?
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2503.92,2509.209,"I don't it's -- well, I think it is significantly different because it's still compensated service."
1965.280,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.018,2517.369,Yes.
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2517.369,2535.742,"-- I would like to make this point that here, of course, at the time this settlement was made, the railroads involved were able to estimate, at least they thought they were able to estimate the total cost of this package."
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2535.742,2542.292,"And this application to fellow veterans during last war, I take it, never got into the negotiation?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2542.292,2544.217,Never got into the negotiations.
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.126,2653.282,"Well, it did provide for the furlough, or didn't it, expressly?"
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2653.282,2653.988,I beg your pardon sir.
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2653.988,2667.109,"As I noticed at page 10, the furloughed oiler as such was taken care of provided herein at least $26,000 as an oiler engineer from 1958 to 1959."
1965.280,1,21883,edward_f_butler,,2667.109,2679.593,"I think there is another significant provision that is directly relevant to the point that I was just making, Your Honor, contained on page 12 of this agreement."
1965.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.83,2937.683,"What's your answer, Mr. Posner, to that argument in this respect that there's nothing about the Selective Service and Training Act which limits the authority of the parties to make this claim of a standard as the measurement, agree upon this kind of a standard even though its consequences to set out the veterans three years credit that otherwise he'd have were just length of service."
1965.280,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,2937.683,2940.341,"Well, I think there are two answers."
1965.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.045,2994.95,But on the other hand do you concede that the parties that the employer here and they could agree now to make earnings the basis for seniority and therefore not include any times spent in the military?
1965.280,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,2994.95,3000.468,"Well, I think if the -- and test of earnings might or might not be this."
1965.280,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.205,3018.95,"Well, all you've got unfortunately is the provision in the contract, were going to make the separation by total earnings."
1965.280,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3018.95,3033.225,"Well, I think that would be a difficult case, but I think if the basic point, and again, it would -- something would have to known in that case about the circumstances of the provision."
1965.280,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.205,3064.25,"Your point is that the man -- if an employer is going out of business and he's going to make a separation pay provision, well then -- and it's going to be based on anything that is related to employment which the veteran could not perform because he was in the service."
1965.280,2,40232,richard_a_posner,,3067.906,3077.134,"Yes, with the qualification that if the nature of the benefit is one designed as actual compensation wages."
