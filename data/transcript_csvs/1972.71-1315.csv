1972.71-1315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.487,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1315, Alexander against Virginia."
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,32.71,38.418,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1315,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,128.711,143.708,"Well, Mr. Dietz, my recollection of Roth was that the concession was that the materials involved were obscene, whether hardcore or what, it wasn’t suggested."
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,169.523,177.475,"Well, because Your Honor wrote the opinion for the Court, I was not involved in that case so I --"
1972.71-1315,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,177.475,181.35,"Well, you don’t find the words “hardcore pornography” anywhere in the opinion, do you?"
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,181.35,188.634,"No, sir, but I understood that there were exhibits submitted of hardcore pornography."
1972.71-1315,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,188.634,189.758,I know nothing about it.
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,193.166,197.474,I stand and correct it.
1972.71-1315,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,214.707,216.242,"Well, I think that’s a different argument."
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,216.242,219.43,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.474,369.531,"What’s the First Amendment got to do with jury trials, at least on its face?"
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,369.531,396.082,"Well, I recognize that the First Amendment does not spell out the jury trial, but if you take the Roth case definition of what is obscenity and what is not constitutionally protected under the First Amendment, then it must be decided by community standards and the community is the jury."
1972.71-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.082,405.448,You want not only a jury but a jury of the kind they’ve got 500 years ago where the jury brings its own knowledge to decide whether to hear the evidence.
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,405.448,407.468,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.492,434.281,"But that was a criminal case, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,434.281,436.473,Smith versus California was a criminal case.
1972.71-1315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,700.571,705.54,Do you think it makes a difference under the First Amendment whether they have 1 or 250?
1972.71-1315,0,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,705.54,706.021,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.037,1128.647,"Very well, Mr. Dietz."
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1131.529,1136.229,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court.
1972.71-1315,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.681,1167.118,So there’s nothing about conduct in this case?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1167.118,1167.579,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.579,1169.942,"It was just the suppression on the book, sales of books."
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1169.942,1171.691,That’s correct.
1972.71-1315,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1230.651,1232.149,"Mr. Kulp, let me ask you a question."
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1258.303,1258.834,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1274.722,1277.54,Can he give them away to minors?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1277.54,1277.962,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.278,1380.579,"Mr. Kulp, when the state prevails in one of these proceedings, what happens to the books?"
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1380.579,1386.178,"The books are permanently enjoined, as they were in this case, from being sold."
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.178,1386.931,But they are --
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1386.931,1391.426,There’s no destruction statute involved.
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.942,1401.6,Is that to say that the state doesn’t keep them.
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1401.97,1402.731,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.731,1404.217,No.
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1408.426,1413.531,"That’s correct and if he violates it, of course, could be subject to a contempt of court."
1972.71-1315,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1413.531,1417.458,"Well, as I had interrupted, what, 339 different books involved in this case?"
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1417.458,1418.377,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.005,1423.88,Are these whether hard-covered book or --
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1423.88,1425.099,Most of them soft-covered.
1972.71-1315,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1432.696,1433.585,Photographs?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1433.585,1434.831,Photographs.
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.831,1441.017,So this ends up as an injunction against some kind of an attempt to sale.
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1441.017,1441.412,"Yes sir, it is --"
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.412,1442.049,Is that all?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1442.603,1446.049,"Well, it’s against the books and it sales that --"
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.049,1447.388,They may not be sold?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1447.388,1449.09,"They may not be sold, that’s correct."
1972.71-1315,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1449.09,1454.9,Can he live the store open as a library?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1454.9,1458.708,"Well, I think that he might then subject himself to a criminal penalty."
1972.71-1315,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1458.708,1459.871,About what?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1459.871,1462.076,If the books were sold.
1972.71-1315,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1462.076,1463.644,"I didn’t say sell it, just leave it open."
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1467.873,1473.383,"I would say, there’s no probably no statute in Virginia which would prohibit that."
1972.71-1315,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1473.383,1480.57,"You would disguise this all along as an in rem procedure, but of course an injunction is not an in rem procedure, is it?"
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1480.57,1481.354,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.138,1495.061,The injunction -- did the injunction name anybody?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1495.061,1500.575,"Yes sir, it names the people who are the producers or the publishers of these books."
1972.71-1315,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.575,1502.201,"But it enjoins them, doesn’t it?"
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1502.201,1502.808,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.6,1512.993,How do you get in rem out of that?
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1515.332,1515.817,Yes.
1972.71-1315,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.83,1540.603,"Under Virginia procedure, it’s a possible offense for someone else who had no connection with the people who are defending against the state in the first action?"
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1552.367,1560.614,"No, I think that, probably, they would be able to litigate it in some other situation."
1972.71-1315,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.614,1569.407,"Well, wouldn’t it be res adjudicata as to the book itself if it’s an in rem action as to the first stage?"
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1569.407,1585.227,"Well, I think it would be a decision to the effect that those books have been declared obscene, but I don’t think that the injunction would only apply to those people who were brought into Court as parties or who were served with notice."
1972.71-1315,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.227,1587.634,Is this an ancient statute or --
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1587.634,1587.884,"No, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1601.536,1608.351,We’re talking about 18.1-236 that’s on Page 19 (a) of the --
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1608.351,1608.57,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.57,1612.104,Certiorari petition.
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1634.189,1634.743,"I don’t believe so, Your Honor."
1972.71-1315,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.743,1636.278,Violate the order.
1972.71-1315,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1636.278,1661.185,"Well, it says at Page 19 (a), the order of the Court below was in accordance with its findings that the magazines listed are declared obscene and the said Alexander Collier and Village books Inc. Media Arts and Guild Quest Limited are hereby restraint from either the sale or commercial disposition of the forementioned magazines."
1972.71-1315,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1662.236,1664.247,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1315,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2120.433,2121.883,"Thank you, Mr. Kulp."
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2127.649,2144.654,"If it please the Court, I’d like the opportunity to answer a few of the questions that the Court posed to Mr. Kulp."
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2250.135,2251.193,What do you suppose that means?
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2256.312,2262.805,I believe that they intended it to open the door for them to use this in a criminal prosecution.
1972.71-1315,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2318.737,2332.356,"Well, is the temporary restraining order, procedurally under this statute, directed at the period between the seizure of the book and the determination of its quality?"
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2332.356,2334.209,I would have to assume so.
1972.71-1315,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.572,2387.213,"Well, was the temporary restraining order, in effect, between the date of the seizure and the date of the hearing?"
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2387.213,2388.996,It was never issued.
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2435.025,2435.262,So all of these --
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2435.262,2436.069,That’s what stopped --
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.069,2436.85,Excuse me.
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2436.85,2437.056,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2437.056,2438.648,"Excuse me, I didn’t mean to -- I’m sorry."
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2438.874,2445.389,"Well, I say that’s what stopped the Court from issuing the temporary restraining order."
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2445.389,2455.022,"But under this statute, all you -- all that the -- it’s ultimately secured if there’s a finding that the book is obscene."
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2458.168,2458.684,Well --
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.684,2460.543,That’s the way it looks to me.
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2460.543,2473.808,"Well, I wouldn’t say a declaratory judgment -- well, right, a declaratory judgment, but it says it’s only to be used to establish scienter when anybody should have any further use for it."
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2484.213,2486.294,Or after such a declaratory judgment.
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2486.294,2500.588,"Or after judgment, then they could come into Court and get around the -- what this Court said they must prove in Smith versus California as far as scienter or knowledge of the obscene nature of the material by a bookseller."
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2500.588,2511.017,"Yes, but there is no -- ultimately there is no -- this statute itself doesn’t either -- it doesn’t impose any restraint ultimately on the sale."
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2517.909,2561.79,"That’s according to the statute but, as it was applied and had the entire order printed in the petition for certiorari on Page 19 (a), the judge did issue a permanent injunction against my client and restrain them from either the sale or commercial distribution of all of the magazines, and that -- all of the magazines, that’s an interesting point because -- and I argued to the Court below that some of these magazines had been considered by this Court in different cases, but he’s still enjoying those as well, even though this Court had applied constitutional protection to these magazines."
1972.71-1315,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2561.79,2566.714,To the specific issues or just to the same magazine on some other issue?
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2566.714,2569.634,"As it so happen, this was the same magazine."
1972.71-1315,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2571.978,2572.846,"Well, that would be the whole story, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2572.846,2584.137,"Yes sir, but if you look at the magazine involved, you just compare it and the magazines were girly magazines and the only thing that changes is the face of the girl."
1972.71-1315,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2589.639,2594.831,And the Supreme Court of your state affirmed that permanent injunction?
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2594.831,2603.742,"The Supreme Court of Virginia inferred the entire proceedings of the Court below, and I argued this point in the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia."
1972.71-1315,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.742,2612.021,"And they said, didn’t they, that where something was found to be obscene, it was perfectly proper to enjoin them?"
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2612.021,2614.192,I don’t --
1972.71-1315,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.192,2616.618,"It fits to that effect, didn’t it?"
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2616.618,2619.412,"Well, the general effect was they sustained the lower court."
1972.71-1315,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.143,2628.791,"Yes, but they didn’t pass -- they did say “where something is found to be obscene, under Virginia law it’s proper to enjoin them.”"
1972.71-1315,2,41229,stanley_m_dietz,,2628.791,2637.089,"I believe that’s a general effect, Justice Rehnquist, but-- well, I’ll say no more."
1972.71-1315,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2700.467,2701.223,"Thank you, Mr. Dietz."
1972.71-1315,3,31319,james_e_kulp,,2723.89,2728.154,I believe I might be able to answer that right now.
1972.71-1315,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2765.386,2766.469,"Very well, thank you."
