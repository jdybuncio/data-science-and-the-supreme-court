1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.762,"We will hear argument next in No. 79-5146, Rawlings v. Kentucky."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,53.304,55.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,191.974,195.938,Does it make any difference how they got into the young lady's purse?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,195.938,208.509,"Your Honor, under the first analysis that we propose for automatic standing, we would suggest no, it does not matter how they got there, except in a situation -- no, I would say under automatic standing it would not matter."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.509,212.336,"Well, what if it turned out that the search of the purse was perfectly legal?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,212.336,216.99,"I'm sorry, the question that was addressed to me, Your Honor, was how they got into the purse, not how it was taken out."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,216.99,217.497,I see.
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.373,225.623,I thought his question meant whether getting into the purse was legal or not.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,225.623,226.294,Well --
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,226.294,230.953,"Of course, it makes a difference whether it was legal, getting into the purse was legal or not."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,230.953,232.378,With regard to automatic standing?
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,232.378,232.589,Yes.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,232.589,236.419,I would suggest with regard to automatic standing that would not deal with --
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,236.419,238.872,"All right, you might have standing, the only thing is you would lose."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,238.872,240.106,"On the question of the merits of it, yes."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,240.106,241.051,You would lose.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,241.051,242.672,"Yes, Your Honor, I agree with you."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.144,246.669,All right.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,246.669,258.408,"Addressing the question of automatic standing in this situation, I would like to refer to three major concepts that are involved here, and I think -- excuse me, there would be two, and the first one would be subdivided into three concepts."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.283,362.537,That wouldn't be an inconsistency.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,362.537,377.112,"Well, Your Honor, I can only say to you that I have seen numerous cases on appeal in which that type of ruling has been made by the trial court and affirmed on appeal that that is enough of an inconsistency to allow the question of credibility to be raised."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.679,380.298,There are bound to be --
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,380.298,391.677,"The real issue, Your Honor, is will it deter a defendant and his defense attorney from going ahead and challenging the propriety of a Fourth Amendment violation."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.843,412.795,How much do you think is left of McGautha after our subsequent --
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,412.795,428.046,"I don't think that McGautha -- I don't think the question in McGautha was reached, perhaps in dicta, but it was a discussion which is relied upon by the petitioner in the previous case to show what you meant by Simmons, and that is all I am using it for."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.307,469.177,"It seems to me that all your reasoning is that the defendant should be encouraged to do everything he can to prevent the prosecution from establishing the truth or falsity of the charges it brings against him if there is some constitutional implication in the thing, and that no weight should be attached whatever to the usefulness of the trial as a process for finding out whether or not the charges are true."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,469.177,472.315,"I think there are two important considerations, when I respond to that, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.416,546.438,"Before you leave your first point, which as I understand it is that your example is that if something is found in a suitcase and he is charged with possession of that item, he can't later on get on the stand and testify sort of tangentially about it."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,546.438,546.9,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.9,551.663,Wouldn't that argument apply equally if he were charged with murder and there were a gun in the suitcase?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,551.663,552.474,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.474,554.976,That is really not particularly related to the automatic standing.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,554.976,555.412,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.045,660.79,"The trial judge always has the right and duty, doesn't he, to exclude evidence that isn't probative or isn't relevant to the issues?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,660.79,665.804,"I think that is an interesting question you ask me, Your Honor, because I would point to two things."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.521,694.848,"I am talking about a trial, which is where a -- assuming the suppression motion doesn't end up with a finding of guilt or the imposition of a sentence."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,703.787,716.62,"Non-probative and non-relevant, but the point is an prosecutorial fishing expedition example that we just mentioned, what would happen is that the suppression hearing would generate all kinds of leads, all kinds of information."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.543,720.252,It might lead to the truth.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,720.252,725.109,But the point is the defendant was only taking the stand for the purposes of establishing standing.
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.411,739.058,"Well, if he is not guilty he has got nothing to hide, presumably."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,739.058,745.498,But what you are doing is you are placing an incredible burden on his right to assert standing.
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.526,765.619,Do you suggest this is a fishing expedition?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,765.619,772.435,"I would suggest that when we peruse the suppression hearing number two in the case at bar, there was nothing more than a prosecutorial fishing expedition."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.435,774.477,"Well, you made the suppression motion."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,774.477,775.45,"Your Honor, I did not make the suppression motion."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.45,781.46,"Well, the government certainly doesn't make suppression motions."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,781.46,791.461,"But the point is, even under Simmons he was allowed to go into that suppression hearing to be protected when he made his statements to allege standing, that they would not be in turn used against him."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,802.602,811.078,"I am baffled at your constant repetition of prosecutorial fishing expedition that arises out of a motion made by the defendant, not by the prosecution."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,811.078,844.102,"No, Your Honor, it does not arise out of the motion to suppress, it arises out of not allowing automatic standing and forcing the defendant to take the stand, not to establish the merits of the Fourth Amendment claim but to establish whether or not he has the right to even raise the merits, and that is what the automatic standing rule was generated to prevent, and that is what Simmons does not answer and that is why I suggest to you that the dilemma of self-incrimination continues to persist despite Simmons for the defendant and the defense attorney who is counseling him, and those are the three reasons."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.102,849.351,"Do you mean it persists because if he takes the stand he might be in difficulty, is that your point?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,849.351,859.185,"Your Honor, as in this case, the prosecution in this case wanted to establish not only possession but possession for the purposes of sale, trafficking."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.509,866.581,Where is he testifying?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,866.635,869.236,"He is testifying at a suppression hearing pretrial, that's right."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,869.236,871.59,And that can't be used against him?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,871.59,872.92,"Well, that is the point."
1979.79-5146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.944,892.443,"Well, if he doesn't like that he doesn't have to make a motion to suppress."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,892.443,901.115,"That's true, Your Honor, but at the same time the motion to suppress concept is to stop the government from violating constitutional rights."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,925.628,928.863,Do you mean that is the chief motivation of the defendant?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,928.863,930.815,"I don't know, sir, I don't propose to say that."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.942,947.959,"What the courts have said is the court's reason for doing it, which are wholly independent and separate from the defendant's purposes --"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,947.959,949.397,"I acknowledge that, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.561,997.076,It seems to me that part of your argument really is that the cross-examination by the prosecutor going into the motives was really improper examination and I wonder if your argument has the same force if one presumes the trial judge wouldn't allow that kind of cross-examination.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,997.076,1000.837,"That is what I was trying to get to a moment ago, Your Honor, and I guess i lost track of it."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1038.82,1044.583,"Now, stopping right on that question, if they asked him a question that was outside the scope of the suppression hearing --"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1044.583,1044.808,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1044.808,1050.527,"-- and the judge forced him to answer, haven't you got a compelled incrimination claim as to that particular answer?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1050.527,1054.102,"I would like to think that you do, Your Honor, and I would like to think that Simmons would stand for that."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1054.102,1055.295,Why wouldn't you have?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1055.295,1068.418,"Well, the problem that I see is the very difficulty begins to demonstrate when they turn up a witness as a result of this and they say, well, we had this witness before, we say well, you got this witness as a result -- it becomes a very difficult problem."
1979.79-5146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.527,1157.15,You had four theories in your brief.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1157.15,1160.29,"Four theories, Your Honor, perhaps I did."
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1247.232,1261.029,"Well, if they had had a warrant to search her purse, the fact that -- say they had a warrant to search her purse for stolen checks."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1261.029,1261.503,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1261.503,1266.637,And they searched her purse and found some drugs that happened to belong to your client.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1268.15,1272.322,"No, sir, no more than he could object had she consented."
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1272.322,1276.476,Then his interest in the property seized isn't enough.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1276.476,1277.792,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1279.777,1281.716,"Not if they were legally in the purse, it isn't enough."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1281.716,1293.7,"That's right, because his privacy right and his interest in the property seized when he turns it over to somebody else is minimized by her ability to control the use of it."
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1305.063,1317.412,You are saying that his property was seized as a result of an illegal search of a purse in which he had a joint interest or in which he had a privacy interest.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1317.412,1322.974,He had a privacy interest generated by the fact that he was storing something within it with her permission.
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1322.974,1325.754,Did she consent to his placing this in the purse?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1325.754,1326.658,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1327.11,1329.002,Isn't there some dispute about that?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1329.002,1335.839,"Yes, sir, but may I point this out, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that in the suppression hearing Vanessa Cox did not testify."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.133,1385.96,"Well, a finder of fact has a right to disbelieve the testimony of anyone."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1385.96,1386.93,He didn't.
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.292,1399.346,"Well, have they said that she did give him permission?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1399.346,1400.69,"Yes, it has been accepted through the --"
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.69,1404.305,I mean have they said specifically that she did give him permission?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1404.305,1411.113,"They have said that the items were placed in her purse with her knowledge, yes."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.113,1413.114,"Well, that is not the same thing as permission."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1413.114,1422.438,No finder of fact has ever based a decision to deny the motion to suppress in this case on the basis that there was not permission given.
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.438,1440.711,"Well, why did anybody ever have to get to automatic standing then in this case if you are claiming that you have a privacy interest in the purse, that the seizure of your property was the product of an illegal search of what is in effect your property, why the big hassle about automatic search?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1440.711,1454.048,"Well, because when it started, Your Honor, the very first thing that the trial defense attorney did was say this is a possessory offense alleged to have occurred and the possession at the time of the illegal search and seizure gives us automatic standing."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.014,1465.294,"Well, was this claim ever made to anybody, this particular theory?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1465.294,1467.524,"Yes, sir, it has been presented all the way through the case."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.524,1469.305,And has been rejected at every level?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1469.305,1470.281,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.281,1475.419,"On what basis, that you didn't have an interest in the purse or what?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1475.419,1486.58,"On the basis that he was vicariously asserting somebody else's rights, that's exactly right, that even though he was saying that there were his drugs and he admitted ownership, the Supreme Court of Kentucky says --"
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.58,1487.543,That wouldn't be enough.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1491.845,1495.326,He testified that when he placed them --
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.326,1500.4,And did the courts reject a claim that he had a privacy interest in the purse?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1500.4,1501.718,In the purse itself?
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.718,1502.388,Yes.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1502.388,1503.393,"Your Honor, I don't believe I ever said that."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.393,1505.125,"Well, you have to have that claim and doesn't --"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1505.125,1512.498,What happens is the possessory interest in the thing that is contained in the repository generates the privacy interest.
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.639,1514.228,Not so.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1523.094,1523.576,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.576,1526.049,-- that your interest in the property wouldn't have done you any good.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1526.049,1530.042,"Exactly right, nor would interest in the purse have done any good."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.042,1535.254,"All right, I agree with you, or if there had been a warrant to search the purse, it wouldn't have done you any good at all."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1535.254,1536.538,"If it was a legitimate warrant, that's exactly right."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.538,1537.903,"Yes, a legitimate warrant."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1537.903,1538.335,"I agree, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.335,1541.006,So you've got a claim of some privacy interest in the purse.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1541.006,1543.529,"No, Sir, I don't agree with this and I think that your [ILLEGIBLE WORD] --"
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.529,1544.489,Then you never did then.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1549.788,1560.302,"No, I am saying that we claimed a privacy interest in the issue that were placed in the purse and therefore the protection of the purse, that is exactly right."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.743,1565.818,"But that doesn't make for automatic standing, as Justice White said to you before."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1566.921,1581.274,"Well, Your Honor, we are entitled to automatic standing unless you find that automatic standing no longer exists and that was rejected, and then we were forced to take the stand and admit ownership, and that is where we have an actual standing, and a reasonable expectation --"
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.274,1595.37,"Did you ever present to the lower courts your third argument that you present in your brief, that the search of the purse was --"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1595.37,1596.793,Violated reasonable expectation?
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.793,1602.23,"-- no, was the fruit of an illegal search of the house?"
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1602.23,1602.995,"Oh, yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.792,1611.3,Here is a warrant that -- the search of the purse took place after the warrant issued?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1611.3,1612.317,That's right.
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.317,1614.259,So they had a warrant to search the house.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1614.259,1615.09,You bar --
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.09,1622.252,And you say the warrant to search the house didn't authorize anybody to search a person in the house.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1622.252,1623.567,Exactly right.
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.567,1638.463,"So that any guest in the house could object to overstepping the search warrant and the search warrant was overstepped by searching the person, timely a purse and hence your property was seized and is a fruit of an illegal search."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1638.463,1638.951,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.577,1640.849,Is that presented anywhere?
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1640.849,1642.9,"It is presented all the way through the proceedings, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.951,1769.15,You haven't told us the entire conversation.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1776.826,1777.372,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.134,1843.123,"Mr. Aprile, let me ask you one question."
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1869.997,1881.144,"I noticed in Criminal Law Reporter just recently, I can't remember, I think it was the California court that just recently said you had no expectation in a fast food cup, expectation of privacy in a fast food cup."
1979.79-5146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.726,1883.033,That is heartening to know.
1979.79-5146,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,1885.014,1897.039,"I think, Your Honor, that in Arkansas v. Sanders, the very strong reference to the fact that it didn't matter, that this was a briefcase that was unlocked, you know, I think that really fits quite well with the purse."
1979.79-5146,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.486,1942.434,Mr. Fox.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,1942.434,1947.436,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2292.99,2295.914,"Except for Simmons, there would be a problem for the defendant."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2295.914,2302.158,"There would be a problem for the self-incrimination aspect, yes, Your Honor, as with any other defendant."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2302.158,2307.288,"So absent Simmons, what do you think about Jones?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2307.288,2308.301,What do I think about Jones?
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2319.082,2331.819,Do you think under Simmons that not only any evidence at the hearing but any fruits of that evidence would be excludable?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2331.819,2335.195,Are you referring to the fishing expedition aspect of it?
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2335.195,2346.994,"Well, suppose -- I take it under Simmons if the defendant took the stand at the suppression hearing and said I had possession of these drugs, that that would be excludable at his trial."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2346.994,2347.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2347.663,2362.261,"Suppose he said some other things that gave the prosecution some hints and they tracked down some other evidence as a result of what they heard at the suppression hearing from the defendant, do you think under Simmons that all those things are excludable, too?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2362.261,2365.806,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe that they are all excludable."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2370.566,2381.801,"Well, isn't there something to what your friend on the other side says about the dangers of overruling that part of Jones?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2381.801,2393.724,"If these other statements, other items go to the issue of guilt or innocence or go to guilt, as Simmons refers, I believe they would be prohibited by Simmons."
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.398,2432.039,"What if at the suppression hearing the question that your friend hypothesized, that is, did you have these drugs for the purpose of selling them, and an immediate objection, the objection is overruled by the hearing judge and he is ordered to answer, now would that be held as self-incrimination?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2432.039,2451.858,"Well, Your Honor, under Kentucky law the charge of trafficking does include not only possession but the sale, and so forth, and it would be no more so than that is the purpose of Simmons, to prevent the assertion of the Fourth Amendment right at the expense of the Fifth Amendment, the self-incrimination."
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.89,2472.504,"Is the question that I postulated to you relevant to the suppression hearing, that is, did you have these drugs for the purpose of selling them, did you intend to sell them, had you sold some of them, is that relevant?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2472.504,2474.132,It is really not relevant or material.
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2474.132,2475.861,"It shouldn't be allowed, should it?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2475.861,2478.29,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.29,2491.361,"But if he is compelled under an order of the court to answer, he is being compelled to incriminate himself, isn't he, unless that evidence is excluded at the trial."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2491.361,2496.653,He has not been compelled to incriminate himself because that evidence is not admissible at trial because it goes to --
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2496.653,2503.28,"I said unless, unless you exclude it at trial, that is the only protection he has got against self-incrimination."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2503.28,2504.812,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.812,2506.209,So you concede that?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2506.209,2515.268,I will concede that without the Simmons protection anything he says at the suppression hearing can be used that goes to the issue of guilt.
1979.79-5146,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.268,2525.968,"Actually, prior to Jones all of the trend in the lower courts has been exactly the opposite to Jones, had it not, that the defendant had simply to fish or cut bait on the question?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2525.968,2527.757,"Yes, Your Honor, that was basically it."
1979.79-5146,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.417,2546.896,And Learned Hand had written one of those opinions.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2546.896,2548.394,"I am unaware, sir, of that."
1979.79-5146,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2548.394,2559.283,"Mr. Attorney General, isn't it true, lawyer to lawyer, that when you lose your suppression hearing on a drug case, you go to jail?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2559.283,2561.017,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, I didn't --"
1979.79-5146,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.017,2575.678,"From all practical standpoint, in a dope case, a narcotics case, when you lose your motion for suppression of the evidence, isn't that the end of the road for the defense?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2575.678,2582.103,"I would say that if the evidence is overwhelming and goes to his guilt, yes, Your Honor, that would be."
1979.79-5146,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2587.981,2591.289,You don't think that narcotics is in a category all by itself?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2591.289,2593.562,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1979.79-5146,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2593.562,2606.424,"Well, how many cases are you aware of where dope is admitted in evidence where the man was acquitted?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2606.424,2613.185,"My personal experience is I am unaware of any, Your Honor, because we only get those where he is convicted on appeal."
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.185,2619.135,Perhaps the moral of that story is that you should keep out of the narcotics business.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2619.135,2620.551,"Very well, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2657.882,2662.28,"Mr. Fox, let me ask you something."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2715.522,2718.179,He would have to demonstrate some reasonable expectation --
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2718.179,2718.755,Sure.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2721.312,2724.156,I would hope that he would be capable from his viewpoint.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2724.156,2726.96,"Sure, he gets on the stand and says, ""I was a guest in the house."""
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2726.96,2730.41,"He goes through, you know, why he was there, what his interest was --"
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2730.41,2737.094,"And they seized my drugs, wouldn't you say that is excludable?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2738.653,2743.762,The ultimate issue of whether or not the evidence must be suppressed I won't make a judgment on.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2754.025,2755.219,Yes.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2755.219,2756.363,-- there is no question.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2756.363,2758.234,That he gets it excluded.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2758.234,2760.989,As a result of it not being a search of --
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2760.989,2765.085,"No, it is a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2765.085,2768.089,It is a warrantless search under --
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2768.089,2772.841,"All right, it is a warrantless search of a house in which he has a privacy interest."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2772.841,2774.068,He has an expectation of privacy.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2774.068,2775.156,Exactly.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2790.152,2795.819,They first arrived on the scene to serve an arrest warrant.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2796.63,2797.892,They didn't search the lady then?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2797.892,2798.777,They didn't search here then.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2800.686,2802.944,They waited until they had a search warrant.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2802.944,2808.396,Then they searched her and they thought at that time they had a valid search warrant to search her.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2808.396,2810.063,"Well, that isn't so, is it?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2810.063,2814.034,"It turned out that the warrant was not, but it still did not change the --"
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2814.034,2815.743,Why not?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2817.601,2825.189,"That's right, but they thought they were obtaining a warrant for the people and that is evident from the evidence, the testimony of the officers."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2837.22,2842.228,"No, I am asking you whether he had a reasonable expectation on the premises."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2842.228,2843.99,As a casual visitor?
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2843.99,2845.213,Yes.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2848.338,2852.828,"He walked in, he was a transient, he had never been there before, there was no evidence to that effect."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2852.828,2854.702,Let's assume he was.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2859.152,2860.356,I misunderstood Your Honor.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2864.715,2869.137,"Well, he didn't have his drugs in a dresser drawer, he had his drugs in the lady's purse."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2869.137,2871.742,Which was just another transient.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2880.72,2881.0,All right.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2901.196,2911.103,Your example is relevant only in the fact that his mere presence is and of itself the sole determining factor.
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2923.995,2938.693,"What do you think is the consequence of this young lady's answer to him, ""David, I do not want to carry this"" -- referring to the drugs -- ""I do not want to carry this in my purse."""
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,2946.344,2971.023,"It would indicate that first of all it would have no effect upon his expectation of privacy in her purse, applying the factors, and assuming that he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in her purse under the Fourth Amendment substantive right process, does the fact that he placed his drugs in her purse create an expectation of privacy."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3099.956,3102.073,"What did the search warrant cover, by the way?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3102.073,3104.567,The search warrant covered the premises.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3104.567,3105.267,For what?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3109.036,3109.916,I do not recall.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3112.006,3112.75,It isn't?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3112.75,3114.433,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3114.433,3116.869,"Well, why did they ever go get a warrant?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3120.762,3126.767,They went in and in searching for the individual named in the arrest warrant --
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3126.767,3130.257,Do you mean the search warrant isn't a part of the printed record or isn't a part of the record that was here?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3130.257,3131.987,"It was never a part of the record at all, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3131.987,3134.236,"Well, can you get it from a lower court?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3134.236,3140.855,"I happen to have a Xerox copy in my office, but I don't recall --"
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3140.855,3152.78,"I suppose if you have a warrant for -- if you have a warrant that authorizes you to search a premises for marijuana, you can look almost anywhere on the premises for marijuana."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3163.087,3165.998,I believe we would have problems under Ybarra.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3165.998,3169.93,Why?
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3172.529,3174.263,If the purse was sitting over by itself --
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3174.263,3175.08,Yes.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3175.08,3176.103,-- I agree with Your Honor in that case.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3176.103,3196.153,"Well, the court below in this case said that although warrants do not ordinarily authorize the search of persons in a room, the search of this purse wasn't the search of a person."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3207.235,3232.407,Our trial court in its opinion also -- and I will make this point -- we have basically since I believe the Court of Appeals intermediate said that the search of her purse was a warrantless search and must be justified under some other exclusion or some exception to it.
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3234.498,3236.66,So you've abandoned that part of the trial court's --
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3236.66,3238.789,"Basically, Your Honor, we have."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3261.698,3272.948,"If we agree with you on your automatic standing theory, we have to reach in order to affirm, we still have to reach any other Fourth Amendment issue that is fairly before us."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3272.948,3282.005,"We have to -- assuming that the automatic standing no longer exists, we then must look at the facts of this case, surrounding this case within that concept."
1979.79-5146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3283.92,3286.863,"Well, we have to answer the questions that he raises in his petition for certiorari."
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3286.863,3302.952,"That is correct, that is that he had an expectation of privacy in her purse, which we deny, and that his expectation of privacy in the drugs was insufficient to constitute a protected interest."
1979.79-5146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.952,3309.628,"Mr. Fox, on the question of whether he had an expectation of privacy in her purse, how do we answer that?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3320.75,3343.509,"Well, there are some factors that we must look at, and I would -- basically these are the nature of the premises or the activity involved, the personal interest in that point, the steps taken by the individual to protect that privacy, and whether society really characterizes that as something which is to be protected."
1979.79-5146,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3402.287,3412.376,"Suppose he handed this to her and put it in her pocket or her dress, would he expect any privacy then?"
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3412.376,3414.275,Her expectation of privacy --
1979.79-5146,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3414.275,3415.748,I'm going to be fair with you.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3419.855,3422.247,Basically I will answer your second question.
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3471.941,3476.624,Suppose as an alternative she had been charged with possession of the drugs.
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3476.624,3477.612,"We wouldn't be here, Your Honor."
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3477.612,3481.243,Then she would be able to assert the Fourth Amendment right to --
1979.79-5146,1,43588,victor_fox,,3481.243,3482.477,By all means.
1979.79-5146,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3494.426,3495.058,"Thank you, gentlemen."
