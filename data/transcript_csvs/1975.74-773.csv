1975.74-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.677,"We will hear arguments next in 74-773, Hudgens against the National Labor Relations Board."
1975.74-773,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,65.208,68.141,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.529,204.075,"Mr. Cohen, let me ask you, why does this case arise under the National Labor Relations Act?"
1975.74-773,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,210.998,211.744,That is correct.
1975.74-773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.744,213.739,Why does it then arise under the National Labor Relations Act?
1975.74-773,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,213.739,225.34,"Because the Union representing the pickets involved filed a charge against Hudgens, the owner of the center and under the Labor Act, any employer can be subject to a charge."
1975.74-773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.902,272.454,"Would the Board’s reasoning carry over so far that if you did not have a shopping center, but had a simple street and your client had a place on side of the street with a parking lot and another business had a place across the street without a parking lot and the employees of the place across the street wanted to organize in that place, but they could not find any access, so they said your client’s parking lot was the nearest place they could make contact."
1975.74-773,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,283.261,287.986,I think the position that the Union has taken in this place would support that reasoning. The Board’s --
1975.74-773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.986,288.95,Do you agree with it?
1975.74-773,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,288.95,290.041,"No, I do not."
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2227.894,2234.206,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2345.065,2346.047,Mr. Come.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2346.047,2347.21,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.21,2367.101,"What if instead of the shopping center situation that the record here shows, you had an employer on one side of the street, another employer on the other, nothing to do with one another and the Union wanted organizational picket on the employer on the south side of the street, but there was no real access there."
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2380.269,2382.249,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.178,2398.762,"Why, for purposes of the Act as opposed to the constitution?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2398.762,2436.134,"First of all, I think that, for purposes of the Act, in the situation that you are positing unlike here where you have a closer interrelationship between the shopping center owner and the store owner, this was not explored in this case because the party stipulated that Hudgens was an employer and that was as far as the matter went."
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.976,2439.533,"In my hypothesis, both employers would be important in the Act?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2439.533,2462.174,"Yes, however, if it were necessary to dispose of this case, findings could have been made that Hudgens, in view of its relationship to Butler, not only brought Butler onto this center in terms of the lease."
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.208,2495.036,"How could you have found that Hudgens was acting as an agent of Butler unless Butler told Hudgens, in effect, “get out there and stop those people?”"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2495.036,2510.389,The Act also has a very liberal definition of agency which says that the mere fact that there has not been any specific direction or authorization is not controlling.
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.3,2573.67,There are two factors as I understand it.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2581.181,2582.441,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2582.441,2586.73,"And secondly, that this was not an organizational picketing, but rather consumer picketing?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2586.73,2588.734,"That is correct, by employees."
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2588.734,2589.629,By employees.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2591.797,2592.988,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.988,2595.72,You say distinguishes this case from Babcock & Wilcox?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2595.72,2597.018,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.018,2633.025,"Would it be a fair question to ask you that is it the Board’s position, is it your position on behalf of the Board that Babcock & Wilcox applies only to organizational picketing if you had an employer such as was involved in that case without -- whose property was private property, but the picketing was of the nature that we find in this case, would the Board say that was a different case from Babcock & Wilcox?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2633.025,2641.577,I do not really know the answer to that because I think that you do have the factor that the property is different.
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.266,2646.196,You understand my question?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2646.196,2646.694,I understand.
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2646.694,2650.801,Assume the property were the same as in Babcock & Wilcox.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2650.801,2651.105,If the property --
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2651.105,2659.374,"That the picketing was as in this case, then what rule would the Board apply?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2659.374,2673.176,"I think that the Nickel’s case that was alluded to by my adversary would indicate that, in that case, the Board would have applied Babcock."
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2686.446,2694.724,"That was the law on the Board which really means, if you parse it down, that your second factor is not a distinguishing factor, does it not?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2694.724,2697.455,It is not.
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2702.547,2704.647,It is in the light of the present Board --
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2704.647,2741.02,"Yes, however, I must point out that this is a situation where the Board, perhaps more than usual, is feeling its way because its view of this has had to be refocused considerably in the light of this Court’s decisions in Central Hardware and Lloyd which are only about three years away."
1975.74-773,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2741.02,2758.915,"Mr. Come, pursuing the discussion you and Mr. Justice Stewart have been having, assume in this case that there were no Union agreement between the Union and the employer with respect to the warehouse employees and assume further that the Union was attempting to organize the warehouse employees."
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2776.087,2777.88,"Yes, I think it would be."
1975.74-773,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.88,2781.783,Is that compatible with your responses to Mr. Justice Stewart?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2781.783,2783.979,"Yes, because I think it was."
1975.74-773,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2837.384,2843.625,"Mr. Come, just one more question before we leave this line of thinking."
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2858.347,2864.69,"No, I do not think so, Your Honor."
1975.74-773,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2884.042,2888.599,That was on site why the organization was directed against the employees of the store.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2918.943,2950.76,"Well, as I understand the scope of the protection for mutual aide protection of Section 7 gives, fellow employees have a right to appeal -- employees in one segment have the right to appeal to fellow employees working in other places of the same employer."
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.27,2992.528,You are saying you have got a free-standing store on the fence on a public street and it has a parking lot for the customers behind.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3029.485,3038.57,I do not think that it is a Babcock test and I think you have to make an accommodation --
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.57,3052.635,"Let us assume there is a gated parking lot on the public street and the employees could just as well picket on the public street, but they say “no, it is much more effective if we come right into the back door on the employer’s parking lot.”"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3064.771,3072.374,The reason I am hesitating is that I do not know of a case that exactly presents that situation.
1975.74-773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3084.519,3085.546,Mr. Come.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3085.546,3085.946,Yes?
1975.74-773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3085.946,3108.3,"Are you familiar with shopping around here where the decision in Logan and Tanner which says “I am sorry, you have to go up the ramps and park and most people, I gather, most customers enter those two stores from the parking lots which are elevated a couple of stories above the street and not at the entrance of the --"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3108.3,3122.707,"It would depend upon, as it is here, whether or not there is a wholly public area where that activity can be reasonably carried on."
1975.74-773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3122.707,3124.955,You must know those stores.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3133.566,3154.107,"I would say, in that sort of a situation, you would probably find that the public places would afford an adequate opportunity, but I think it would depend upon whether they do or do not."
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.107,3155.955,I do not care about the answer.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3155.955,3156.398,Yes.
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.398,3160.083,What is the rule that would apply?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3164.172,3170.043,"In that situation, it would be the Babcock test because that is not quasi public property."
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.78,3190.026,Alright so you would say -- you do say that even though if the employer’s own employees picketing that they may not use his property to picket him and the consumer picket except in conformity with Babcock.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3202.209,3216.626,Except that where picketing is involved the question is also whether there is an alternative public facility where that activity can be carried on.
1975.74-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3258.139,3258.927,We will resume there at 1 o'clock.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3258.927,3273.582,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3273.582,3294.506,"Mr. Come, I think you have some time left."
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3294.506,3319.112,"Petitioner’s counsel, in response to a question from Justice Stewart, indicated that there could well be concurrence between the constitution and the statute if this were a pure company town such as we had in Marsh against Alabama."
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.554,3426.129,"There was a much different fact situation than this though, is it not?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3426.129,3439.13,"That is true, but in a sense though it was a more difficult case in that it was truly private property."
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3451.816,3453.86,What makes you think this is a quasi public?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3453.86,3464.216,"It is quasi public because, in all material respects, it is like the shopping center in Logan Valley."
1975.74-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3464.216,3467.952,How much of Logan Valley do you think is left after the Lloyd case?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3467.952,3474.114,I think that quite a bit of it is left.
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3633.012,3644.847,"Mr. Come, with the Babcock in these circumstances, did the Board indicate whether that test would be satisfied here or not?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3644.847,3650.4,I think you can talk about Babcock on sever levels.
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3666.66,3680.315,"The rule was that or is it the Babcock rule, if there are other reasonable means of getting the message across, private property rights need not give way?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3680.315,3684.555,"That is correct, but we do not have pure private property here."
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3684.555,3686.127,You have said property rights.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3713.605,3727.285,"I submit that there are no other reasonable means of reaching the potential customers of the Butler Store that you are not trying to bring to the store, but to turn away from the store."
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3729.963,3732.486,Assume there were other reasonable means?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3732.486,3757.654,"I think what would be wrong with what it is that you would be ending up with a lesser right under Section 7 than the constitution would give you on this particular property, and I submit that that would make a vindication of the right to picket and strike dependent upon whether you brought suit in a Federal Court or you brought a charge before the Labor Board."
1975.74-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3759.258,3762.931,What if the constitutional right were measured that way?
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3779.027,3789.557,"Well, that would be a question as to whether the Board would be right if it were to extend it further."
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3849.218,3859.213,"It is the constitution, does it not, that gets you anywhere except against governmental action?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3859.213,3862.487,"That is correct, but --"
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3862.487,3872.478,"Until and unless Mr. Hudgens here could be equated with government, there are not rights at all under the constitution?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3872.478,3873.384,"That is correct, and that --"
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3873.384,3885.446,"Nevertheless Mr. Hudgens can be equated with a company town in Marsh against Alabama, there is no need to talk about anything under the constitution because it simply is inapplicable?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3885.446,3888.956,I think that there is a middle situation.
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3888.956,3890.098,That is what I do not understand.
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3898.314,3906.131,"I had problems too, but I think we have to start with Tanner as a given and having that as a given --"
1975.74-773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3906.131,3909.884,"No, one really has to start with the constitution as the given?"
1975.74-773,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3909.884,3962.261,"That is correct, but this Court interpreted the constitution in Tanner and I think ended up with a middle situation which although is not as much state action as a company town in Marsh against Alabama, is enough state action to invoke the constitutional protections provided you can satisfy the relatedness and the inability to make the appeal on public property test and we believe that on the facts here the Board has satisfied those tests."
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4106.933,4109.929,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-773,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4159.691,4166.51,Do you understand that Logan Valley had created some intermediate twilight zone kind of a situation?
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4173.167,4175.033,"That was my understanding, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-773,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4190.52,4191.959,In which case?
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4191.959,4194.306,"In Lloyd versus Tanner, the majority opinion --"
1975.74-773,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4194.306,4195.805,I thought you were talking about Logan Valley.
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4195.805,4210.256,"No, I read fully, as I read Logan Valley, it equated the situation in Marsh and the situation that was before the Court at that time."
1975.74-773,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4253.333,4254.391,But you are faced with.
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4254.391,4255.893,Yes.
1975.74-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4255.893,4260.59,How do you say Lloyd created a different rule than Logan?
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4260.59,4278.502,"Well, my understanding, Mr. Justice White, of Marsh is that you do not have to show that the message that you are communicating is one which is directly related to the store in front of which you are standing or to the general shopping center area."
1975.74-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4341.958,4356.815,But Logan saved those situations where it might be said that the activities of being engaged in were not related to the uses to which the shopping center was dedicated?
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4356.815,4360.352,It saved it as an open question.
1975.74-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4360.352,4368.576,It did not purport to say that the Logan rationale would apply where the activity was not related?
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4368.576,4369.472,I do not disagree with that.
1975.74-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4369.472,4373.768,Then what is different between that and Lloyd?
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4376.33,4384.623,"No, Mr. Justice White, I did not mean to imply that Lloyd was inconsistent with Logan."
1975.74-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4510.647,4523.315,"Mr. Come said he did not think there was any other adequate means of communication, but you did not treat the specifics mentioned by Mr. Come."
1975.74-773,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4525.427,4533.208,"Yes, we have two basic points that I would make on the alternatives."
1975.74-773,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,5208.045,5210.146,Yes.
