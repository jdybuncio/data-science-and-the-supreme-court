1998.98-531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.441,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-531, Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank and the United States."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,51.305,56.257,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.167,90.34,"Well, Mr. Glogau, what is it exactly that was patented here?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,90.34,94.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, I... that's a good question."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.626,115.295,I thought that's pretty easy.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,118.029,129.757,"--Well, Justice Scalia, this... this case is here before us on a motion to dismiss and whether or not... we certainly don't admit that we've infringed on the patent."
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.398,196.87,What are the remedies in Florida for patent infringement?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,196.87,197.521,I'm sorry.
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,197.521,200.633,What are the State remedies in Florida for patent infringement?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,200.633,209.299,"In the Jacobs Wind case, Justice Stevens, the petitioner in that case brought a patent infringement case against the State of Florida in the Federal court."
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.664,251.785,"Well, let me... let me just be sure I have an answer to my question."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,257.197,257.999,That's exactly correct.
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,257.999,260.401,That you have to prove you've taken the whole patent.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,260.401,262.772,You have to prove that there's been a taking.
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.063,277.433,"Well, let me just simplify."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,282.646,290.831,"--I'm not aware that any case like that has ever been brought, Your Honor, but clearly the Florida Supreme Court said that that remedy is available."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.831,301.009,"How many times has Florida infringed patents as far as we know, and infringed them intentionally, which I would assume would have to be a condition for a taking?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,303.36,306.433,"Well, I... I presume you could."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.433,308.512,Is that right?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,310.513,310.663,"Well, no, no."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.214,312.806,--Takings Clause by a negligent act?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,312.806,316.698,It can only be a taking... a negligent act by a... a State--
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.698,322.181,"So, how many times to your knowledge has Florida intentionally violated somebody's patent?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,322.181,322.541,--Never.
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.541,325.543,But you're not suggesting--
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,325.543,325.724,Well--
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.724,328.395,--that intent is an element of patent infringement.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,329.757,331.978,--Intent is an element of patent infringement?
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.249,335.202,"It's an element of the takings claim, however."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,342.425,346.589,"Well, it's not coextensive, but that doesn't mean it denies due process, Your Honor."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.589,354.583,"Right, but neither... neither can the... the use of... of section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment extend to unintentional takings."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,359.427,365.73,"Well, and indeed, the Federal remedy for patent infringement is exactly congruent to the remedy I'm suggesting exists in the State law."
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.73,379.431,"Once you notify the alleged infringer that the infringer is infringing on your patent, then one can't... and the infringer continues, one can't claim that the action is unintentional at that point."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,379.431,385.885,"Well, Your Honor, at that point you go to patent counsel and get an opinion, and that's how patent... patent lawsuits progress."
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.885,386.955,Whatever.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,407.918,423.58,"Yes, I would concede that, Your Honor, that... but... but the problem is that... that just because the State is accused of infringing a patent, and even let's assume for the sake of argument, that the patent is infringed, that is not a constitutional wrong."
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,427.583,431.745,"Well, you... one part was the absence of deliberate conduct."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,451.356,462.636,"Your Honor, it's not necessary for an inverse condemnation case to be prosecuted, that the entity being accused of the taking have the power of eminent domain."
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.813,478.774,"I thought answer then is that you can't do it, State."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,482.818,494.376,"Well, you could... in... in the patent infringement situation, if you're looking for prospective relief to stop the infringement, you have an Ex parte Young... you have an Ex parte Young--"
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.376,501.241,You said the State remedy would be compensation for the State's exercise of eminent domain.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,501.241,506.624,--Compensation for the State's exercise of its police power or... or whatever power--
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.624,508.345,"Well, you said it would be a takings."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,517.318,518.321,--That's correct.
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.142,522.455,"And here the question is, can the State take?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,534.133,541.576,"--Well, to the extent that the Tenth Amendment prevents Congress from taking away powers that are reserved to the States, I think the general power of eminent domain would apply."
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.967,556.036,"I don't understand the Tenth Amendment because I thought right in the Constitution there was the Patent Clause, that that was going to be given over to Congress would not reserved... we don't get into the reserved powers to the State when we're dealing with patents, do we?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,556.036,561.331,"--Well, that's the... the power to issue the patent certainly is exclusively within the Federal Government."
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,602.768,606.161,"So, are you changing the answer now and saying that, yes, a State can take a patent?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,606.161,608.922,"--Well, I think that the State--"
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.922,612.065,"Suppose some State says, gee, we really like this patent, so we want to have it."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,614.148,623.294,--I don't think that there's any... I don't think there's any limitation inherent in Federal law that prevents the taking of the patent.
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.694,629.217,"Mr. Glogau, what do you... what do you say to this argument?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,658.205,658.966,"Well, that--"
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,658.966,659.116,Am I right?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,659.927,660.097,--That's absolutely correct.
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.097,660.378,All right.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,730.634,732.867,"The uniformity has several components, Your Honor."
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.586,751.978,"Well, but the Federal circuit is no longer going to get a crack at this... at the cases that come out of the State courts."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,751.978,753.2,--But if... if there is a--
1998.98-531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.2,755.972,But I suppose this Court would.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,755.972,756.783,--That's exactly--
1998.98-531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.783,764.687,"I... I assume that we sit to require uniform interpretation of Federal law, do we not?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,764.687,766.798,--That is one of the functions of this Court--
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,766.798,767.67,And is it also--
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,788.424,789.445,--The--
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,789.445,790.615,Isn't that also true?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,790.615,796.311,--The Federal circuit was not created until fairly recently in the 200-year history of patents.
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.311,799.601,"Well, it has been created... it has been created now, and doesn't it express that judgment of Congress?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,799.601,803.174,"If... if that judgment is correct, that the uniformity that--"
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.174,804.896,"Well, isn't that the judgment of Congress?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,804.896,807.308,"--But that's a legislative preference, Your Honor, because--"
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,807.308,813.972,"Well, it's a legislative preference I presume in... in aid of the... the power given to the National Government under the Patent Clause."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,813.972,814.433,--If... if--
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.433,816.703,"And... and it does express that preference, doesn't it?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,816.703,818.224,--If the Federal circuit is necessary--
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,818.224,818.594,Doesn't it?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,818.594,825.96,"--If the Federal circuit is necessary to grant due process to patent holders, then what you're suggesting is that from 1790 until the--"
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.96,833.904,"The question is not whether it is an absolute necessity, and I think it's... I think you... you concede this in your argument."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,874.741,875.021,--Your--
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,875.021,877.402,Isn't that a fair application of section 5?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,877.402,887.03,"--No, I don't think so because the differences in remedies between the Federal remedy and a State remedy has never been in this Court's jurisprudence a... a due process question."
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.03,901.268,"Well, we've never had a... a case under the Patent Clause in which the very premise of the exercise of any congressional power is that there should be, in effect, an exclusive Federal scheme for the sake of uniformity."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,901.268,912.085,"Well, Your Honor, the basis... extending that argument, the basis that Congress used to... to enact this abrogation of State sovereign immunity is, in effect, that they felt that the States needed to be treated like everyone else."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.11,944.328,"Well, now, you... you don't concede that the... that the implication of the Patent Clause is that you or that anyone could reasonably find, including Congress, that the implication of the Patent Clause is that you must have a uniform Federal remedy in Federal courts because the very Congress that enacted the... the very convention that... that put in the... the Patent Clause also did not put in a provision for Federal courts."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,944.328,945.207,That's correct.
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.948,954.824,"It was envisioned in 1789 that you could... you could have a patent law without having Federal courts passing upon the Federal patent law, except at the Supreme Court stage."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,954.824,955.585,--That's correct.
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,955.585,963.861,And the question I suppose is whether that judgment in 1789 is now a sound judgment and whether Congress has the power to revise it for the sake of uniformity.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,983.011,993.389,"Under... under Article I, under the Patent Clause, Congress can make that judgment for everyone except the States because the Eleventh Amendment prohibits them under Seminole Tribe."
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,993.389,1005.376,"So, the answer is when the States are involved, Congress does not have the power by any means, including section 5, to prescribe a scheme for uniformity in the interpretation and litigation of patent law."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1005.376,1014.032,That's correct because the States' infringement of patents has never been shown to be a constitutional due process violation.
1998.98-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.032,1014.623,"No, but suppose... suppose--"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1014.623,1014.923,In fact--
1998.98-531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.923,1019.536,"--Mr. Glogau, this act was passed in 1992, wasn't it?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1019.536,1020.147,--That's correct.
1998.98-531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.147,1025.098,Do you know how many suits have been brought against States under it for patent infringement?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1025.098,1025.44,I'm sorry.
1998.98-531,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.002,1042.76,"In fact, the uniformity premise is... is not entirely accurate, is it, because what Congress has done is subjected the States to triple damages, to attorney's fees, and it doesn't even subject the Federal Government to that."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1045.05,1045.982,That's correct.
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1052.968,1056.391,"So, Congress bracketed the States as a matter of substantive law?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1057.059,1057.48,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.556,1104.302,May I ask if it would be adequate in your view of the Eleventh Amendment then if Congress treated the States the same way as it treated the United States?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1106.753,1107.554,1498.
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.554,1113.168,"--If that... if they said, States, you're liable, but just the way the United States is, no more, no less."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1113.168,1120.925,"I would suggest that a remedy like that would be more congruent with any perceived harm, but again I... I--"
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.925,1123.095,"Well, as far as the Eleventh Amendment is concerned--"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1123.095,1128.578,--do not concede that there is a... a constitutional basis for section 5 legislation here because there is no due process violation.
1998.98-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.578,1136.663,"--Suppose that... that what I read is true, that... that the future lies in intellectual property, the economy's future."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1168.854,1169.465,My view of the--
1998.98-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.465,1172.848,"I mean, it sounds as if it is, and if that's what it is, that's what it is."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1178.09,1183.693,"--Well, my view of the Constitution is that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits an... a... an act like this."
1998.98-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.671,1193.902,"No, no, no."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1198.183,1198.543,"Well, that--"
1998.98-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.543,1203.487,And we also know that people need security that their intellectual property won't be infringed.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1205.129,1212.913,--But... but the point is that the vast majority of the cases that are going to be brought under the Patent Act are not going to be cases against the States.
1998.98-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.811,1226.993,This is helpful.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1254.163,1273.387,"--To the extent that any of those issues that you've raised constitute property that is protectable under the Fourteenth Amendment, once again unless there's a premise that there's been some unconstitutional conduct, then the States must be allowed to create their own remedies."
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.459,1301.363,"Mr. Glogau, is it... is it unusual that we are... that the Federal Government is inconvenienced in its dealing with foreign nations because of our Federal system?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1301.363,1302.866,"No, I think--"
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.866,1304.155,Is... is that at all unusual?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1309.208,1311.191,--We also have NAFTA where... where--
1998.98-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.191,1316.083,"Do we have the ability to eliminate the death penalty, therefore, because it inconveniences our foreign relations?"
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1316.083,1316.413,--No.
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.206,1321.746,"Yes, that is a separate issue, all right."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1366.015,1377.042,Certainly it can't... I would have to concede that the States are engaging in activities that are involved with intellectual property more today than they were 100 years ago.
1998.98-531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.583,1392.763,"No, of course not."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1436.511,1449.991,"No, because if the State denies even the first person due process, then under a... a proceeding like what happened in the McKesson case, this Court ultimately will be able to say to the State of Florida, you've denied this person due process."
1998.98-531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1499.864,1502.154,Are there also State tort remedies?
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1505.437,1506.479,"--Yes, there certainly are."
1998.98-531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1510.372,1511.574,Let me ask you this.
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1536.609,1540.062,Congress would have authority to address the problem under section 5.
1998.98-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.717,1588.735,"May I ask just in... whatever... a taking, whatever the label is in the State court, all of the law that would be applied to determine whether there was infringement, that would all be Federal."
1998.98-531,0,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,1589.173,1589.814,Absolutely.
1998.98-531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.227,1597.631,"Thank you, Mr. Glogau."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1599.762,1606.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.427,1656.819,Don't you think that City of Boerne modified some of the language in Morgan?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1656.819,1657.067,Yes.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.499,1719.789,Excuse me.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1738.702,1746.487,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, but what Congress did here was to take a look at the... at a problem."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.577,1751.16,Let's look at the Fourteenth Amendment objective.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1751.16,1751.519,--That's correct.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.681,1752.881,Okay.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1758.905,1764.569,--Congress considered a number of reported cases that involved State patent... State sponsored patent--
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.569,1764.779,How many?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1769.972,1771.204,--Eight I believe.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.204,1775.017,--1887 and 1990 there were eight.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1775.017,1776.856,That's... that's correct.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.856,1778.557,This is a big problem.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1778.757,1788.254,"They also considered testimony, Your Honor, that infringement by the States is expected to increase as the States... the States rush to commercialize--"
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.254,1788.444,Why?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1793.707,1794.418,--They're--
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.418,1799.161,Did they say that intentional violation by the States was going to increase?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1799.161,1806.056,"--As... well, they said that the States are going to become more involved in... in patents as they--"
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.056,1813.499,"To be sure, but did they really think that the States were intentionally going to be violating people's patents more and more?"
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1815.662,1815.973,--Well--
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.973,1820.415,"Because that's the only Fourteenth Amendment violation, an intentional violation of somebody's patent."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1824.488,1829.311,"--In fact... well, I don't know about the frequency, Your Honor, but they considered that very problem."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.06,1844.771,May lead?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1849.554,1859.079,"In the context of this case, Your Honor, there's... there is certainly a basis on which the Congress could have concluded that the due process rights of patent owners--"
1998.98-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.079,1860.511,Are the two of you debating what's in the legislative history?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1860.511,1862.482,"--In some measure, Your Honor."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.219,1878.743,"We're not using the legislative history to determine the meaning of the statute, are we, as Justice Stevens often does?"
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1878.973,1883.508,"No, Your Honor."
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.132,1904.911,"Mr. Culligan, do you think that Congress' authority here depends in any way on the fact that Congress under its Article I patent power granted the patent in the first place, or does that have nothing to do with it?"
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1904.911,1915.618,--I believe that Congress has authority under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect property that's deprived without due process regardless of the origin or the source of the property.
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.152,1940.134,"So, if Congress had decided that States are really not giving people a square deal on inverse condemnation cases, or the State may occupy something without having condemned it and they figure maybe the damages aren't enough, Congress could have done that too."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1940.134,1944.746,"Yes, I believe that's within their power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1998.98-531,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.172,1964.749,"If you say... if you take that position, then you don't have to take the broad position that anything Congress likes, it can make a Federal property right and, therefore, enforce it under section 5."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,1970.403,1975.167,--I believe that this is not a case at the fringe.
1998.98-531,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.744,2026.97,"There is no argument, I guess, here that the power arises under the Patent Clause."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2026.97,2042.28,"The power that arises under the Patent Clause is... grants Congress authority to create a patent system that, in exchange for the disclosure of the inventive contribution, the inventor gets a limited right--"
1998.98-531,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.28,2042.74,"No, no."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2056.179,2057.59,"--No, I have not... I have not made that argument."
1998.98-531,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.59,2057.82,--so there probably--
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2057.82,2071.799,"But the... the very special nature of the patents gives... gives rise to an analogous argument, and that is the State's arguments are predicated on the notion that they have the power and the right to deprive persons of their patent property."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.112,2098.366,"--Well, they may not have the right to do it, but it's a separate question of whether their violation of that right is a constitutional violation."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2123.874,2126.126,"Two responses to that, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2151.521,2152.993,"Are you sure of that, Mr. Culligan?"
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2174.649,2181.801,"--Your Honor, as... as I understand the nature of the patent right, the answer is no."
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.801,2183.464,And what's... what's the authority for that?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2183.464,2184.653,The Supremacy Clause.
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.653,2195.512,"Well, I'm sure if Congress said, when it issued a patent, that no State shall have the right to condemn it, it could do that under Article I, but Congress hasn't done that."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2195.512,2205.167,But the States have always appreciated that they are bound not to deprive persons of... of their... their sole right to exclude.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.95,2211.431,Why is this different from Federal land patents?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2222.058,2225.602,"In... in the context of land, I believe the answer is yes, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.114,2232.585,It's the one involved in your case.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2232.585,2232.925,--That's correct.
1998.98-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.306,2235.166,It's not only that--
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2235.166,2236.108,And ours... and ours is a very--
1998.98-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.108,2240.548,"--but if one State could condemn a patent, all 50 States could, but all 50 States can't condemn a piece of land."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2240.548,2258.503,"--This Court held in 1933 in... in the Dubilier Condenser Corporation case that, quote, the only value that a patent has is the right it extends to the patentee to exclude all others from making, using, or selling the invention for a certain period of years."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.656,2293.843,"Well, that may well be that they cannot take away without sort of distorting the patent right, the right to exclude others, but they can take away the exclusivity insofar as it applies to them."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2304.702,2312.527,"If one State condemns a patent right, it is the private patent owner of the right to exclusively license to someone else."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.527,2313.157,"No, no, no, no."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2332.89,2336.582,"If they did, Your Honor, it's... we're back to Dubilier."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.398,2349.291,There would be 50 States who would have a right to use it without paying the patent owner.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2356.945,2369.724,"--The State's ability to use the... the patent at what is essentially way below market rate, that is, zero, for no compensation, would greatly diminish the ability of someone to license... license the patent--"
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.724,2370.363,--for zero?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2376.029,2389.277,--This Court in... in Bonito Boats unanimously stated that one of the fundamental purposes behind the Patent Clause is to promote national uniformity in the realm of intellectual property.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.206,2408.58,"Well, let's assume all the 50 States did this and you had suits in Federal court."
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2412.872,2415.063,"In the Federal courts, Your Honor?"
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.063,2415.243,Yes.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2415.243,2417.226,"It's... that's conceivable, but of course--"
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.226,2419.907,But the law would always be uniformly interpreted because--
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2419.907,2420.618,--That... that--
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2420.618,2421.407,--we would review it here.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2421.407,2422.439,--That's correct.
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.439,2423.879,And that would be the same thing in the State courts.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2423.879,2427.832,"No, Your Honor, because in the State courts, they would not be bound by the decisions of the Federal circuit."
1998.98-531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.363,2454.349,Don't you think this Court would have the power of review and to issue rulings on what the law is so that it would be uniform?
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2454.349,2465.996,"Yes, Your Honor, and what we would... what we would see is... is 50 to 100 years of litigation with the same... with questions coming back to this Court time after time from the 50 States."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.035,2488.791,It's remarkable that the Framers did not envision this as a problem when they adopted the... the Patent Clause because they adopted a Patent Clause without adopting a provision for Federal... for Federal courts.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2488.791,2489.162,That--
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.162,2492.253,It's perfectly optional whether there would be Federal courts or not.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2492.253,2493.835,--May I respond to the question?
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.835,2494.126,Yes.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2494.126,2497.889,"Circumstances have changed, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.54,2501.72,But the Constitution hasn't.
1998.98-531,1,33789,kevin_j_culligan,,2501.72,2505.073,Thank you.
1998.98-531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.363,2508.916,"Mr. Waxman, we'll hear from you."
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2508.916,2517.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.316,2564.751,"Mr. Waxman, these infringements that Congress was concerned about, do we have any reason to think that they were intentional infringements?"
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2564.751,2574.948,"--We absolutely do, and the reason is that the nature... and I think this may be something that... I... I... as a non patent lawyer, I wasn't aware of until I got involved in this case."
1998.98-531,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.158,2634.036,"General Waxman, what was the theory on which Congress thought that the States pleading sovereign immunity to a patent infringement denied the patent owner due process?"
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2634.036,2639.741,"--Well, I think, Justice Rehnquist, that goes to the question, obviously, of what is due process."
1998.98-531,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.604,2647.616,"Well, then what are you... what are you arguing?"
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2647.616,2653.029,"The... the... ordinarily the deprivation of recognized property, and I will later--"
1998.98-531,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.029,2665.417,"But you say deprivation, but a... you're saying a plea of sovereign immunity on the part of the State is the same thing as the State actually reaching out and taking the whole patent?"
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2665.417,2682.558,"--Well, the... the patent right is defined by Congress as a result of the direction in the Constitution that Congress secure the exclusive right for inventors, and that's what the patent law provides."
1998.98-531,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.16,2747.832,"What if... what if, say, a State police officer at some emergency scene... he finds himself without a car, so he simply commandeers the car of a private owner and says, I've got to take this for an hour and I'll give it back to you?"
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2750.764,2761.439,--He... under your scenario I think the... any court would say no because there has been a de minimis deprivation of property.
1998.98-531,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.971,2764.892,What if he takes... takes it for 3 days?
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2764.892,2774.769,"--Well, the question then would be, how important is the property right here, that is, how much did the owner lose, and did the State provide a mechanism for remedying that?"
1998.98-531,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2815.435,2830.465,"Well, General Waxman, certainly in theory a State could provide adequate remedies for violation and could, indeed, apply correctly Federal patent law in doing so, could they not?"
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2830.465,2856.672,"--I think it's not only true in theory, Justice O'Connor, but if the Court reads McKesson and Reich v. Collins and General Oil v. Crane the way I read them, or at least the way I advocated in Alden v. Maine, I think a good argument can be made that if Congress provided no remedy at all, the States would be required by the Constitution to provide an adequate post deprivation remedy."

1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2982.085,2983.597,--That's... that is exactly what I mean.
1998.98-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.597,2985.768,--I don't know what... what--
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2985.768,2987.25,If... if you--
1998.98-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.25,2988.61,--evidence there is for that.

1998.98-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.41,3144.652,You're dragging Article I back in again.
1998.98-531,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3159.551,3159.771,--No.

1998.98-531,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3325.341,3331.042,Is that proper for us to look at in determining the proportionality of the congressional response?

1998.98-531,3,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,3497.743,3499.173,"Oh, I disagree."
1998.98-531,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3508.78,3514.964,"Well, there is... there's an administrative set up in the Secretary of Labor to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1998.98-531,3,30413,jonathan_a_glogau,,3514.964,3515.435,That's correct.
