1963.71,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,54.361,58.657,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2529.512,2535.454,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2831.749,2835.121,"So, it was the Commission which found that there was a mixture of --"
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2835.121,2835.971,Yes.
1963.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.971,2838.367,"And that was not passed upon by the Court of Appeals, was it?"
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2838.367,2842.668,"That was not passed upon by the Court of Appeals, but then it wasn't really challenged either."
1963.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2866.202,2866.222,And that was not --
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2866.222,2867.04,-- didn't challenge the --
1963.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2867.04,2869.789,That was not passed on either by the court.
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2869.789,2871.011,"Not by the court below, no, sir."
1963.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2871.011,2872.969,They've accepted it as a hypothesis that --
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2872.969,2874.685,It was by the Commission.
1963.71,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2874.685,2877.523,(Inaudible)
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2877.523,2879.404,"Well, yes."
1963.71,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2944.015,2951.78,(Inaudible)
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2951.78,2953.167,Correct.
1963.71,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2953.167,2958.673,Between the Federal Water Power Act (Inaudible)
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2958.673,2960.407,As it now exists.
1963.71,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2963.615,2966.914,And that's the (Inaudible)
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2966.914,2967.808,1920.
1963.71,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2967.808,2970.493,(Inaudible)
1963.71,1,29728,john_w_cragun,,2970.493,2973.01,That is now Title 1 of the Federal Power Act.
1963.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3303.896,3316.8,Mr. Lakusta.
1963.71,2,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,3316.8,3321.586,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.71,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3907.227,3923.036,"Well, would you say that the Kansas case based its conclusion on the fact that a wholesale sale was of national significance rather than local significance?"
1963.71,2,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,3926.084,3938.581,"The rationale of that case followed exactly in line, Mr. Justice White, with the thinking of the Attleboro case."
1963.71,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3938.581,3941.844,"Well, that's the case the Attleboro case relied upon, wasn't it?"
1963.71,2,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,3941.844,3942.505,Yes.
1963.71,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3942.532,3945.6,Rationale?
1963.71,2,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,3945.6,3957.65,"It -- it did rely upon the Kansas Natural case and it did find, as this Court held later in Attleboro, that a national interest was involved."
1963.71,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4587.085,4596.251,Mr. Bury.
1963.71,3,29123,john_r_bury,,4596.251,4600.407,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.71,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4737.792,4744.15,How about this question of whether or not some Davis Dam power got into it?
1963.71,3,29123,john_r_bury,,4744.15,4756.93,"I think this can best be answered this way, although I would grant you there is a factual dispute which has not yet been subject to judicial review as to the existence of Davis energy."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,5507.026,5510.497,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5762.104,5769.022,"Now, Colton sells this electric power to -- at retail, doesn't it?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,5769.022,5772.657,"It sells its electric power at retail to the inhabitants of Colton, yes, Your Honor."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5772.657,5780.377,"And if some householder's meter begins running too fast, it's Colton, he calls up, doesn't he?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,5780.377,5781.422,"Not always, Your Honor."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5781.572,5784.132,"Well, he may make a mistake and call the wrong person, but isn't it --"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,5784.132,5794.675,"No, we have lots of complaints from tenants of an apartment house who say, “I've got a bill from X Utility Company and I know they're billing me too much.”"
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6669.021,6678.268,"The -- as I understand it, we would get in -- we would not get into this as a factual question at all, here in the present posture of the case."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6697.914,6702.577,"That could be done, Your Honors, but the whole record is before the Court."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6707.081,6714.175,"The Commission found that there was an interstate source, clearly, here."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6714.175,6729.931,"Yes, the Commission, basing its decision primarily upon the testimony of the staff witness who included in his showing only a portion of the system, made the finding that there was energy from Hoover Dam in the sale to Colton."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6739.888,6745.846,And then the Court of Appeals assumed without deciding that there was Hoover Dam energy sold to Colton.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6745.846,6746.623,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6751.544,6754.57,"And which ground, you say, is correct of course."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6754.57,6755.577,They're both correct.
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6755.577,6759.979,"And -- well, they're both -- but, as I understood it, it only decided one."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6759.979,6761.293,They only decided one.
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6763.278,6763.431,Right.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6763.431,6769.062,This is another ground in addition to the Boulder Canyon Project Act upon which it also could've been decided in favor --
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6769.062,6769.941,I understand.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6783.786,6785.384,"Well, it should remand it, naturally, for --"
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6785.384,6787.104,"To where, to the Commission?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6791.74,6792.671,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6792.671,6801.871,In -- in finding -- to the extent that we should remand it to the Commission to reconsider the question of the source of the power?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6801.871,6802.391,I think that it should --
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6802.391,6803.637,Or remand it to the Court of Appeals?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6803.637,6810.676,"If it's to be remanded at all, may it please the Court, it should be remanded to the Court of Appeals since it has not yet had judicial review."
1963.71,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6810.676,6812.347,That's what I thought.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6812.347,6813.732,"Now, to conclude."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6813.732,6814.518,Can I ask you.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6814.518,6816.39,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black?"
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6816.39,6825.022,Is it possible for them to tell that whether some of this electric power came from Hoover and from Davis?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6826.527,6834.417,"Well, it would be possible if the lines which came from California into the Highgrove Substation were metered."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6837.575,6839.118,But they knew the amount.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6839.118,6839.496,If they knew the amount --
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6839.496,6843.247,Does it all get mixed up like drops of water that go to the sea?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6843.247,6852.097,"Well now Your Honor, one of the most eminent physicists in the United States was asked, “Does electric energy mix?”"
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6854.909,6857.849,"Well, has it been proved that it doesn't mix?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6861.784,6874.354,"It's -- it never was proved in this case that all of the Hoover energy might not have gone out to serve California customers over the -- let's say, the Etiwanda line before it ever got up into the Colton area."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6874.354,6876.622,Does it mix somewhere?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6876.622,6878.376,"No, I don't think energy mixes."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6878.376,6881.902,Does -- do you mean that they have different lines that it runs through?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6881.902,6883.477,"No, it runs through on the same line."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6883.477,6884.891,Runs through the same line?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6884.891,6885.617,Yes.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6885.617,6896.294,"Therefore, at some point, this power that comes from Hoover Dam gets in the pipe with power that didn't come from Hoover Dam, is that right?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6896.294,6897.476,It gets on the line.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6897.476,6898.142,It's on the line?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6898.142,6898.816,Yes.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6898.816,6900.418,All right.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6908.923,6916.711,"It could be possible I think Your Honor, if a proper analysis had been made."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6921.328,6921.672,A what?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6921.672,6931.065,A vector analysis could be made in order to determine available loads and sources on electric systems.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6933.486,6939.86,Can that -- have they found any way yet to divide these electrons up and look through and see which ones --
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6939.86,6939.903,No.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6939.903,6942.402,Flow to the end and which ones stop on the way?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6942.402,6943.105,No.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6960.582,6960.76,So that's possible --
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6960.76,6962.855,"Now, that can't be said here."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6962.855,6977.611,"That's possible if you have a stream that has a number of streams coming into it and somewhere, that stream stops flowing so that you, then, pick it up again later, new water comes in you'd know it."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6987.751,6995.544,"Well, Your Honor, that was the burden of proof which the proponents of the argument had, not Edison and not California."
1963.71,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6995.544,6997.729,Can you prove that it's brought from Hoover?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,6997.729,6998.695,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1963.71,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6998.695,7001.672,That if it proves it's brought from Hoover.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7001.672,7003.91,"Yes, to a certain point."
1963.71,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7009.542,7012.926,Do we have the same problem today?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7024.211,7033.279,"Well, that presumption isn't based upon any -- the presumption that electric energy mixes is not based upon anything that was produced in this record, Mr. Justice Clark."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7033.279,7036.486,The law doesn't impose impossible burden --
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7036.486,7036.699,I don't --
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7036.699,7052.463,"On either side, and I -- unless there's some evidence, someway, in here that there's a better way to discover or find out whether the particular electrons that were generated at Hoover didn't go to Colton."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7060.879,7066.343,"Well, sir, I don't think that -- I must respectfully disagree with you."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7077.461,7084.116,"But, maybe it's one of those things, I could say, there's a burden on somebody to show that lightning flashes?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7084.116,7084.688,"Oh, I think that's --"
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7084.688,7084.89,Everybody knows that --
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7084.89,7085.607,-- demonstrable.
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7085.607,7088.188,-- it flashes.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7088.188,7094.413,"Well, you're ask -- you're saying that something is just a matter of common knowledge."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7094.47,7095.099,I would --
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7095.099,7095.213,I --
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7095.213,7110.289,"I would suppose it's a -- it's as much a matter of common knowledge is if water that gets mixed up, its drops gets mixed up and it keeps on flowing, that there's a very difficult way unless you analyze all the drops some way chemically."
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7113.499,7129.941,"Your Honor, the only evidence in this record concerning the mixing of electric energy was by -- perhaps, the world's foremost electrical physicist who said there's no proof that electric energy does mix."
1963.71,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7129.941,7136.75,"Well, the proof that it goes along in the same line, isn't it, propelled by some kind of force?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7136.75,7140.567,"It goes along the same line, but does it mix?"
1963.71,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7140.567,7143.116,"Well, there's proof of that (Inaudible)"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7143.116,7144.41,"Yes, some energy."
1963.71,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7144.41,7153.074,"Can you prove that electrical energy entered the (Inaudible) any white line which, in one way or another, came to Colton?"
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7153.074,7169.875,"It could get to Colton but there is another equally possible inference that it didn't and that Colton was served wholly by California sources which are more than adequate to serve Colton and which are, the record shows, available to serve Colton at all times."
1963.71,4,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7169.875,7171.145,Who mingled it?
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7171.145,7171.853,I beg your pardon?
1963.71,4,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7171.853,7176.709,Who mingled it for (Inaudible)
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7176.709,7177.727,Who can mingled it?
1963.71,4,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7177.727,7178.032,Yes.
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7178.032,7181.342,It's just the physical setup of the transmission lines.
1963.71,4,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7181.342,7185.611,(Inaudible)
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7185.611,7186.612,"Yes, that's right."
1963.71,4,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7186.612,7190.742,(Inaudible)
1963.71,4,36450,mary_moran_pajalich,,7190.742,7196.673,"No, I don't believe that the burden ever shifted to Edison in that respect, Mr. Justice."
1963.71,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7196.673,7201.772,You're asking us to decide a question that the Court of Appeals specifically reserved?
