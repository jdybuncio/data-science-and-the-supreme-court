1992.91-1231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.789,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1231, United States v. Alvin J. Dixon."
1992.91-1231,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,26.281,28.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.266,142.193,"Now, would the prosecutor in those subsequent criminal proceedings prove anything that wasn't already proved at the contempt hearings?"
1992.91-1231,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,142.193,149.196,"In these particular cases, no, the prosecutor would not prove any additional facts."
1992.91-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.631,156.452,So literally it falls within at least the language of Grady v. Corbin.
1992.91-1231,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,156.452,163.856,I think literally it probably does fall within the language of the formulation that the Court adopted in Grady.
1992.91-1231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.084,194.725,Do you think that this Court in Menna and in Colombo at least indicated that it thought perhaps double jeopardy applied in contempt situations?
1992.91-1231,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,194.725,202.164,"No, Your Honor, and let me move directly to Menna and Colombo, because the Respondents discuss Menna and Colombo in some detail--"
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1576.646,1579.514,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.501,1669.655,"You don't contend, do you, Mr. Klein, that these offenses don't meet the Blockburger test?"
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1669.655,1692.604,"--Well, I think, actually, with respect to Dixon, where the court's order was... I'm sorry, with respect to Foster, where the order was do not commit an assault and do not commit a threat as defined by the District of Columbia Criminal Code, that yes, these are like... these meet Brown and therefore Blockburger."
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.675,1704.078,"Well, when I say, meet the Blockburger test, I mean that each contains an element that the other doesn't."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1704.078,1709.565,"Well, I do... I think that they fail the Blockburger... I always get confused which is meeting and which is--"
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.565,1714.851,"Well, it is an ambiguous question, at which side of the fence you're looking at at trial."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1714.851,1716.353,--That's right.
1992.91-1231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.928,1812.8,"Well, does your position mean that any time a criminal defendant having been convicted and let's say placed on probation on typical terms, which is that you be law-abiding, and then the probationer is brought in back to the sentencing court because of committing some criminal offense, not remaining law-abiding, and so the probation is revoked."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1818.019,1820.371,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, because the standard procedure--"
1992.91-1231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1820.371,1820.721,Why not?
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1820.721,1829.392,--The standard procedure there would be to utilize could be to revoke the probation and to put the person incarcerate the person.
1992.91-1231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1830.092,1839.367,"But the probation would be revoked by proving the commission of the offense, so you're right back where you are in this situation."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1839.367,1847.438,"--The difference, Your Honor, is that the revocation of probation is not a criminal proceeding the way a prosecution for criminal contempt is."
1992.91-1231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.438,1853.092,"Well, why is Foster's prosecution treated that way?"
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1863.815,1882.461,"Because this Court has said repeatedly in Young v.... excuse me, in the Providence Journal case, and in the Young case, that a criminal contempt prosecution, regardless of who actually handles the prosecution, is a criminal prosecution on behalf of the sovereign."
1992.91-1231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.034,1923.021,"Well, I wonder if that's accurate in the context in which these things arise."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,1938.114,1952.64,"--Well, no one has doubted in this litigation to this point, and I didn't hear the Government doubt it this morning, that that was in fact a criminal prosecution, a criminal contempt prosecution."
1992.91-1231,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2013.614,2023.304,"Mr. Klein, accepting that point, is there... do you agree that there is a distinction between the Dixon and the... what is it, the--"
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2064.047,2065.647,I assume that's true.
1992.91-1231,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2104.339,2105.958,"Oh, indeed they did, I don't dispute that."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2115.663,2140.797,"--Well, I think that one might be able to say that if we were back at the earlier stage and asking the question whether the court should go ahead and punish for contempt, there would arguably be greater necessity in the one in Foster than in the other, but in terms of whether Foster and Dixon have a right to claim double jeopardy at this point, I think that the cases are entirely the same."
1992.91-1231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.797,2147.117,"Mr. Klein, what you say makes sense to me but for the long tradition of the country."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2160.608,2165.246,"Well, I think I would lose this case a hundred years ago."
1992.91-1231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.243,2186.443,"Debs is the watershed, you think."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2186.443,2188.278,I think that Debs is the watershed.
1992.91-1231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.718,2294.131,"Well, I think you're right that contempt was considered something quite separate from criminal prosecution originally and that it's changed with Debs, but the question is, shall it be considered the same as a criminal prosecution for all purposes?"
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2335.458,2336.158,"I agree, but I--"
1992.91-1231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.158,2340.243,"Why not make an exception for double jeopardy as well, or else maybe--"
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2340.243,2363.042,"--Because the rule that I think underlies Bloom, and which is really the result of the history, is that contempt will be treated as a crime in the ordinary sense unless there's a compelling necessity to carve out a special rule for contempt, and there is no necessity, and this Court's decision in Young, Your Honor--"
1992.91-1231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.042,2377.618,--The necessity is that the Court can be imposing a slap on the wrist for contempt and depriving the prosecutor of the ability on behalf of the people to put the person away for a much longer term.
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2377.618,2378.385,--I disagree.
1992.91-1231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.878,2429.718,"But I mean, what happens sometimes is the court wants to vindicate its dignity and the prosecutor says, I'm not as interested in vindicating your dignity as I am in putting this person away."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2438.59,2440.909,The prosecutor has a choice.
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.378,2477.484,So you have to bring together the contempt prosecution and the substantive criminal offense prosecution.
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2477.484,2478.551,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.001,2481.019,"Well, that's a novel doctrine."
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2481.019,2482.486,"Well, it's not--"
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.486,2484.236,It's totally novel.
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2484.236,2488.288,"--Well, it's novel in the sense that the Court has not--"
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.288,2490.523,I never heard of it being done.
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2491.925,2496.227,"--Yes, and we cite at least one case--"
1992.91-1231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.227,2498.162,One case.
1992.91-1231,1,31331,james_w_klein,,2498.162,2513.005,--We cite at least one case where the Government brought an indictment charging criminal contempt and there's no problem with adding a count in an information or an indictment alleging contempt.
1992.91-1231,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3375.798,3388.856,"Very briefly, first, with respect to the Young case, I think it's important to remember that Young was a supervisory power case that applied only to the Federal courts."
1992.91-1231,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3475.312,3477.431,"Mr. Bryson, may I just interrupt you for a minute?"
1992.91-1231,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3494.875,3509.135,"Well, contempt can clearly be charged, but in many States preventive detention is not available for offenses such as simple assault, and in fact I don't believe--"
1992.91-1231,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3509.135,3513.854,"If that is so, isn't that the problem of the State, not the problem of the double jeopardy clause?"
1992.91-1231,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3513.854,3527.613,"--Well, I'm not sure the solution to the current problem is to get around the problem by creating the capacity for preventive detention for minor offenses and then using it for long periods of time, such as 6 months."
1992.91-1231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.606,3553.664,"Yes, but to the extent that you're concerned that you need to make the contempt proceedings officially serious, is there any limit on the court's power to impose the same punishment they would impose they would impose in a criminal prosecution?"
1992.91-1231,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3553.664,3566.071,"If the court has a statute, a general contempt statute that has no limit on the amount of time that can be made the sentence, that's right, there would be no restriction."
1992.91-1231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3585.133,3587.901,"Yes, but there can be more than one 6 months consecutively, can't it be?"
1992.91-1231,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3587.901,3589.485,"For various acts, that's right."
