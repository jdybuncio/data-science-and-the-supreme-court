1998.97-9361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.117,"We'll hear argument now in No. 97-9361, Louis Jones v. United States."
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,9.086,12.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-9361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.475,165.23,"Were the objections that... the instructions, rather, that you're talking about now, Mr. Crooks... were those objected to by the respondent... by the petitioner?"
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,165.23,166.702,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
1998.97-9361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.054,176.157,On the express grounds of overlap or being duplicative?
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,176.157,185.673,"--I don't recall whether there was an express objection at trial on the grounds of duplication, but definitely there was an objection on the grounds of vagueness and overbreadth."
1998.97-9361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.673,198.011,"Those are certainly the kinds of things that the prosecution could argue to the jury, and so this had the effect of focusing the jury's attention on a certain area."
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,206.597,217.123,"This evidence is, indeed, admissible, Your Honor, as the Court pointed out in Payne, but the problem here is that this is a weighing jurisdiction."
1998.97-9361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.366,240.17,Does the Government concede that the court of appeals was right in saying those two factors were invalid?
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,240.17,242.26,"It does not, Your Honor."
1998.97-9361,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.26,246.754,"It doesn't now, but it did in its brief in opposition to the cert petition, didn't it?"
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,251.537,252.448,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-9361,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,252.448,252.807,--Yes.
1998.97-9361,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,262.123,264.697,"That is certainly our position, Your Honor."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1596.574,1601.707,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.041,1619.96,"On this point, the Government did not file a cross appeal on the holding below that two of the non-statutory aggravating factors were invalid."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1619.96,1626.304,"--And we are not required to, Justice O'Connor, in order to defend the judgment below on a ground that we properly raised."
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1628.204,1629.666,It wasn't mentioned in the--
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1629.666,1630.118,--That's correct.
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.118,1632.658,--brief in response.
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1645.495,1657.486,That was the question that petitioner presented in this case in attacking the ruling of the court below that there were... there was harmful error resulting from the submission of these non-statutory factors.
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.035,1698.212,"Well, but didn't... didn't the Solicitor General's office in its response suggest a rewording of the questions on certiorari?"
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1698.212,1701.234,"We did slightly reword them, but we--"
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1701.234,1704.106,And the court adopted it.
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1704.106,1704.667,--Correct.
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1704.667,1717.893,"And in the third question, the question is whether the court of appeals correctly held that the submission of invalid, non-statutory aggravating factors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1726.178,1731.692,"Well, I think that that's a fair reading of what we wrote at the brief in opposition stage."
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1758.78,1771.529,"I guess if you take it on the assumption that there were two invalids... we don't deal with it, we just assume it... was their analysis adequate?"
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1780.565,1784.977,"Justice O'Connor, I'd like to answer that question on two levels."
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.713,2009.667,"Mr. Dreeben, this is, as they said, a... a weighing State."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2031.075,2048.145,"--Justice Ginsburg, although the Federal jurisdiction is a weighing statute, the jury in this case was specifically given an instruction that it is not simply to count up the number of aggravating factors and treat the numerical significance of that number in comparison to the mitigating factors."
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2065.255,2070.728,"Well, if you don't agree with it, explain to me why young age, slight stature... those are not personal characteristics."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2070.728,2082.396,"They are personal characteristics, Justice Ginsburg, but the argument made clear to the jury that those were personal characteristics relevant to the culpability of this defendant in this particular crime."
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.202,2124.484,But the problem with that is true in almost every case.
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2139.365,2147.309,"Well, Congress interpreted this Court's decision in Payne v. Tennessee as permitting the consideration of this kind of victim impact evidence."
1998.97-9361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2232.865,2252.877,"But isn't it the case that in order to be an aggravating factor, the... the evidence with respect to the victim's personal characteristics or the effect of the family or whatever has got to show that there was something unusually bad, unusually harmful in this case?"
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2294.337,2324.554,"I think the factors would be better phrased, Justice Souter, if they were phrased as you described, but I think that one significant point on which I would disagree with your formulation is that the fact that every crime, every murder has a victim, and every family of a murder victim suffers harm has to be unique or exaggerated in some way beyond the norm in order to be taken into account is not consistent with this Court's reading... this Court's reading of the Constitution in Payne v. Tennessee."
1998.97-9361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.525,2328.919,It's necessary for death eligibility certainly.
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2328.919,2329.877,"--Yes, it is."
1998.97-9361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.877,2337.634,"But once there's death eligibility, in... in weighing the factors, you can take into account routine factors, as well as extraordinary ones, I assume."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2337.634,2339.445,I think that that's absolutely correct.
1998.97-9361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.426,2418.257,It is sort of a misnomer... and you would acknowledge that... to call them aggravating.
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2418.257,2427.204,The victim impact evidence I think is probably better understood as something other than purely aggravating.
1998.97-9361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2462.487,2468.64,"But there's this kind of a converse problem, if you analyze it that way, and I... I see the sense of... of what you're saying."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2515.562,2526.129,"In a weighing State, the jury's deliberations are more channeled and focused by the necessity for finding that there is an aggravating factor before it may consider it."
1998.97-9361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.655,2557.059,"I guess these words are relevant, that anything is aggravating which tends to offset a mitigating factor."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2579.394,2602.94,"The Court has made clear that once a jurisdiction engages in the narrowing that is required under the post-Furman line of cases, at the selection stage, he decision maker can be given as much information as the jurisdiction chooses to do so, and as to mitigating evidence, it must be given the opportunity to hear all that the defendant chooses to put before it."
1998.97-9361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.046,2624.825,"And I suppose the alternative would have been for Congress to say nothing at all and just say the prosecution can argue such aggravating circumstances as it deems appropriate, and then there would be no notice, no way to focus the jury at all."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2624.825,2626.916,"I think that that's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2639.843,2648.22,"Mr. Dreeben, one part of your earlier argument that went by quickly was we know that the jury really emphasized the other factors."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2658.395,2671.374,"--Justice Ginsburg, this Court has made clear that a reviewing Court may conduct harmless error review if a non-statutory... if an aggravating factor that is improperly defined goes to the jury."
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.565,2698.292,"But if it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, it's very hard to say we can make this assumption and that assumption, and if we were the trier, this is what we would have come up with."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2704.269,2709.511,--The court of appeals in this case chose what I think is the hardest method of harmless error analysis.
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.027,2795.91,May I ask you--
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2823.258,2830.843,"Our position is that if the prosecution requests impaneling of a second sentencing jury, the judge should do that."
1998.97-9361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.797,2851.595,"So, the discretion is to prosecutors, not to judges."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2851.595,2852.006,Correct.
1998.97-9361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.006,2853.288,Where does that come from?
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2854.36,2860.294,"There's nothing explicit in the statute that addresses that issue, but I think that it follows--"
1998.97-9361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2860.294,2866.35,"Well, it says, otherwise, and otherwise could... it says, otherwise the judge will impose the sentence."
1998.97-9361,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2871.404,2881.568,"--Justice O'Connor, that language, as petitioner reads it, would encompass every situation in which the jury for any reason did not recommend life or death."
1998.97-9361,2,42514,timothy_crooks,,3380.82,3391.136,"First, I would like to return to Justice Ginsburg's question about the question of harmlessness in this particular case."
1998.97-9361,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3459.241,3459.411,"Well, I--"
1998.97-9361,2,42514,timothy_crooks,,3493.004,3501.299,"Even that instruction might still invite the type of speculation that there might be a lesser sentence, but what happened in this case was--"
1998.97-9361,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3501.299,3508.666,"If he said there are only two sentences possible for this offense, that's a truthful statement of what it was in this case."
1998.97-9361,2,42514,timothy_crooks,,3508.666,3514.98,"--If the jury were told that those were the only two possible sentences, that might have obviated the prejudice in this case."
1998.97-9361,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3531.379,3535.482,"I understand that, but my question is in terms of the cure."
1998.97-9361,2,42514,timothy_crooks,,3543.317,3556.347,"That is one cure, Your Honor, but another cure where, in fact, the lesser sentence option is, albeit erroneously introduced, is also to tell the jury that it will not be the result of a deadlock."
1998.97-9361,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3556.347,3557.8,"Thank you, Mr. Crooks."
