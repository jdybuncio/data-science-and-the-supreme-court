1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.336,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-5961, Robert Lacy Parker v. Richard L. Dugger."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,10.738,13.131,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,76.532,77.924,What did he have to say?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,77.924,84.679,--He stated that there were no mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances.
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,84.679,88.019,"Well, that doesn't mean there aren't... isn't... aren't any mitigating circumstances."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,88.019,96.964,The trial court judge and the Florida supreme court so found that his... found that there were no mitigating circumstances.
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.806,106.441,"Well, what... but what did the... the trial judge said there are no mitigating circumstances that outweigh the aggravating?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,106.441,111.655,"--Yes, sir, and he found no mitigating circumstances at all in his sentencing order."
1990.89-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.655,149.071,"Well, do you think the, the trial judge didn't consider all the evidence?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,153.973,155.843,The trial judge--
1990.89-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.843,165.881,"I mean it, it would appear from the language used by the trial judge that indeed all this other mitigating evidence was, was received."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,173.815,192.668,"--I don't think we could say that because of the fact that he went through the statutory mitigating circumstances and discussed them at great length and made absolutely no mention of the mitigating circumstances even though he had instructed the jury on the mitigating circumstances as, as an eighth mitigating... statutory mitigating circumstance."
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.668,197.3,"Well, didn't he just instruct the jury that they could find these were mitigating circumstances, not that they had to?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,197.3,200.372,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1990.89-5961,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.456,245.583,"Well, under, under Florida law, he's required to, to weigh the statutory mitigating circumstances against aggravating as I understand it."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,246.284,247.185,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,247.185,254.028,Is he required to weigh nonstatutory mitigating circumstances against the aggravating circumstances?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,254.028,255.741,"Yes, Your Honor, he is."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,287.45,289.481,"Well, may I interrupt you, Mr. Link?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,308.654,310.995,I stand corrected.
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.198,323.094,"Under Lockett, but the Florida statute, one just reading the Florida statute and not paying attention to Lockett might not have done it that way."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,323.094,324.947,"--Yes, sir, that is correct."
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.121,366.494,Even though it didn't have to develop it in the first place?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,366.494,368.915,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.963,388.547,"Well, you say they've established a constitutional procedure, what do you mean by a constitutional procedure?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,393.752,399.994,--I would say a constitutional procedure in death penalty parlance is one that has been approved by this Court.
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.994,401.747,"Well, but you don't answer my question."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,406.259,412.994,It is... we do not say that it is required.
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.191,430.264,"Well, then what's your basis... what is the constitutional basis for that statement?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,430.264,435.377,That is exactly what this Court found in Godfrey v. Georgia.
1990.89-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.922,512.818,"Well, didn't both the trial court and the Florida supreme court in this case find or conclude that no reasonable person could have failed to impose the death sentence in this case?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,512.818,515.121,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.942,585.865,"You're in, in essence asking us to review that factual determination of the, of the supreme court of the State?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,585.865,587.308,"No, Your Honor, we're not."
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.308,588.998,Why aren't you?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,588.998,595.282,We are asking this Court to require the Florida supreme court to apply that standard.
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.616,607.38,"Well, we, we can't tell that they haven't applied it without, without entering into the factual inquiry and, and concluding that they were wrong."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,616.316,621.619,"--No, sir, because the, the court told us what it did here."
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.907,691.706,"Mr., Mr. Link, how do you distinguish the claim you're making from the claim that the capital defendant in Lewis against Jeffers last term made, claiming that the Arizona supreme court had not consistently applied its own capital sentencing decisions."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,695.307,698.049,"In... yes, sir... thank you."
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.073,777.741,"Mr. Link, isn't the, isn't the portion of the standard that you claim they didn't apply, the standard that requires them to make some kind of an independent review of the record to determine whether they believe there are mitigating circumstances?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,777.741,778.772,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5961,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,778.772,793.621,"So if they had said not merely that the trial court found none, but had said we have independently reviewed the record and we find no basis for concluding that mitigating circumstances were present, you would not have an argument?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,793.621,795.835,That is correct.
1990.89-5961,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,804.09,810.162,Are we entitled to assume that the Florida court followed its own law even though it did not expressly say so?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,810.162,815.628,I think we have to assume they did not where in this case they said they did not.
1990.89-5961,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,817.989,820.55,"Well, they didn't tell us that they did not do it."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,833.957,840.793,"--I don't believe so, because they say in light of these findings, referring to the trial court's findings."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.793,872.913,"Mr. Link, you're, you're quoting from page 71 of the Joint Appendix, but if you will look on page 70, the Florida supreme court before saying, the trial court found no mitigating circumstances; in light of these findings, we think it's correct... on page 70, the first full paragraph, the court says, in addition to considering all other issues raised on appeal, we have conducted an independent review of the record on trial and find no reason to award a new trial."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,872.913,874.866,"Yes, sir, that, that was--"
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.866,877.557,So apparently they did conduct an independent review of the record.
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,877.557,878.226,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.226,879.017,They have said that.
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,879.017,883.021,"Yes, sir, they did do that in reference to any issues to award a new trial."
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.309,896.178,"You think that does not go to the sentencing phase, that statement?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,896.178,897.11,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.726,918.905,"May I ask you, Mr. Link, if the Florida supreme court's practice changed at all in the period right after 1984 and 1985 in what they did in these cases?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,918.905,922.327,"Yes, Your Honor, it did."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.822,947.734,But not just on statistics in view of their legal approach.
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,962.873,982.075,"I think for any... every general principle one can say about the Florida supreme court one can find exceptions and I, I think that there are a number of cases where the Florida supreme court did rely on nonstatutory mitigating circumstances prior to 1984 and 1985."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.645,1045.215,May I ask you another question?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1046.258,1046.796,--Yes.
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.796,1050.179,"How often are jury's, jury recommendations overridden in Florida?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1061.459,1068.512,They get overridden... I think it depends on... it goes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but with some frequency.
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.589,1079.618,I see.
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1087.064,1088.344,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.2,1100.172,"And Spaziano, too, or was that--"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1100.172,1102.125,"Spaziano was, was not this judge."
1990.89-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.125,1102.526,--I see.
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1102.526,1103.144,"No, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.417,1156.161,So is this an Eighth Amendment question or equal protection?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1156.161,1163.193,"--I think the, the question somewhat melds here when one talks about... in terms of Eighth Amendment arbitrariness."
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.149,1183.877,"The conclusion of the Godfrey court... that was where the court in Georgia appeared not to follow its rule that the victim had to be tortured or, or severely abused."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1223.164,1224.684,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.862,1256.884,"Well, didn't we kind of approve it in Spaziano?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1256.884,1263.199,"When this Court... I don't think so and maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so."
1990.89-5961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.974,1289.906,"Well, I thought in Spaziano we held that the Tedder standard was constitutional."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1289.906,1296.121,"--My understanding was that it was constitutional as applied, as construed by the Florida supreme court."
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.343,1349.145,"Is this... is this your strongest argument, do you think?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1350.818,1353.519,"Yes, sir, we have several others."
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.088,1447.54,"Well, what's the constitutional principle here?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1447.54,1456.927,The constitutional principle is that it denies due process to preventing him from presenting his defense.
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.313,1471.346,So this is a guilt or innocence argument?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1471.346,1472.245,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5961,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.245,1486.105,"Your contention is that, that under the State law, coercion or duress is a defense to, to homicide?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1486.105,1488.336,It is a defense to felony murder.
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.336,1490.648,It is a defense to felony murder?
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1490.648,1491.238,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.521,1514.203,"As I understood that to mean that if, that if you are coerced into a bank robbery, into participating in a bank robbery and one of the other participants kills a bank guard, duress is a defense, but is there any State case that says if you're the one that kills the bank guard?"
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1514.203,1520.297,"--No, sir, and that is... but Your Honors' statement of facts is exactly what we have here."
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.181,1545.475,"An aider or abettor in the murder itself, not just in the bank robbery though, not just in the robbery."
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1545.475,1547.134,--Yes.
1990.89-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.134,1549.206,He was aiding and abetting in the murder.
1990.89-5961,0,39780,robert_j_link,,1566.159,1577.425,"The evidence under his own testimony was that he was present, did nothing to assist in the murder but was told to take the ring and necklace afterwards."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1698.554,1703.887,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5961,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1780.6,1781.841,Did they raise it at the trial court?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1781.841,1783.112,"--Yes, they did."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1783.112,1783.552,Okay.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1783.552,1786.163,There were arguments not so much as to the sufficiency.
1990.89-5961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.434,1985.705,"Ms. Snurkowski, when you say aired it, do you mean considered it?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1985.705,1986.334,--Yes.
1990.89-5961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.393,2038.339,Would the Florida court have been entitled in its discretion to hear this claim on rehearing?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2038.339,2042.911,"If it had found that there was sufficient merit to pique its interest, yes, it could have."
1990.89-5961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.234,2083.67,"Well, suppose the court just says denied for failure... because of failure to comply with our rules that the claim must be presented?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2083.67,2089.601,"--That could have been done and, and in a perfect world I would be very happy if that had occurred, but the point of the matter is the most--"
1990.89-5961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.601,2091.625,"Well, you say held hostage, that's all they need to add."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2091.625,2111.916,"--That's true, but I think that as arguments have been presented to this Court with regard to a case that... just accept the argument hasn't been prepared but the lower court discussed it, that to require a court to say that might necessarily require a detailed opinion with regard to how many justices might view that particular claim."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.172,2214.603,May I ask you a... may I ask you a couple of preliminary questions--
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2214.603,2214.814,--Yes.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.814,2233.607,"--on this, because I have the feeling as I read through the papers that the... all the reference to Tedder just confuses the issue and that what the district court found in this case was Hitchcock error, that there were nonstatutory mitigating circumstances that the record does not indicate that the trial judge even considered."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2238.92,2242.172,I would say there were nonstatutory evidence submitted.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.003,2252.919,"Well, for example, the district court relied on the fact the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the offense and that the Florida court has repeatedly said that's a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2255.8,2258.742,--I don't believe that there was sufficient evidence to show that he was intoxicated.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.328,2273.723,So you would view the trial judge as having rejected as a matter of fact the evidence that he was intoxicated?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2273.723,2275.964,"--Based on this particular record, that is correct."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.964,2282.427,"And how about the second nonstatutory mitigating circumstance the district judge relied on, namely the disparity in the sentencing?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2282.427,2294.826,"Well, in fact the disparity in the sentencing is a very good point, because in fact the person... the ah, Elaine Parker, who was his ex-wife, turned witness and got second-degree murder."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.366,2334.261,"Well, without getting into the detail, you then agree with the district judge in this case that the petitioner's accomplices and codefendants receive lesser sentences for their parts in the Sheppard murder."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2334.261,2337.863,--I am suggesting that there were other sentences... there were other sentences other than--
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.863,2349.343,"But if that is true and if, as he says by citing a bunch of Florida cases, that is regarded as a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance, how do we know the judge gave consideration to it or didn't give consideration to it?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2349.343,2357.278,--This trial judge was also the trial judge in the Tommy Groover case and knew the facts and circumstances and the sentence of death imposed in those cases--
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.278,2366.524,Are you saying that it was not a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance... there was no such nonstatutory mitigating circumstance or that he took it into account and weighed it against the aggravating circumstances?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2366.524,2378.341,--The trial judge in this case... I think he took it into account and found that it was not a valid nonstatutory mitigating circumstance based on the facts and Mr. Parker's participation in the Nancy Sheppard murder.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.341,2380.632,"Of course, he doesn't explain any of that, does he?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2380.632,2384.653,"He, he does not explain, he doesn't go into graphic detail."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.254,2386.005,He doesn't say a word.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2389.668,2390.858,"--That's absolutely true, but he in fact--"
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.858,2401.256,"One other question... would you agree that if he did not give consideration to nonstatutory mitigation circumstances, that he committed constitutional error under Lockett and Hitchcock?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2401.256,2405.247,"--He... I would agree that if there was evidence that he did not do that, that would be--"
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.247,2405.758,"Well, if--"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2405.758,2407.41,--But there is no evidence in this record.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.41,2417.825,--Now who has the burden of establishing whether or not he gave consideration to these nonstatutory circumstances that the district court found to have been established by the evidence?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2417.825,2427.813,I think that the State has to come forward on an appellate review before the Florida supreme court and make an assessment as to whether in fact he properly followed the law as it is applied in Florida.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.813,2432.586,And they interpreted... they said he had found no nonstatutory... no mitigating circumstances.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2432.586,2433.237,What they found was the trial--
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.237,2435.928,No circumstances that needed to be balanced.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2435.928,2436.489,--Absolutely.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.219,2442.774,"But if there were any that needed to be... if there were any, they had to be balanced, didn't they?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2442.774,2451.52,"--They had to be balanced, but important as to what was quoted to the court right after the phrase about how there were four properly applied."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.505,2466.258,And what does that establish?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2466.258,2469.761,--That in fact they were applying an appropriate standard.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.041,2481.328,"Does that mean that they... does that mean that they agreed there were nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, but they were clearly outweighed, or were they agreeing with what they said that there were no such circumstances?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2481.328,2491.454,"They were making their independent determination because the next line says, the jury override was proper and the facts of this case clearly place it within the class of homicides for which the death penalty--"
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.454,2492.746,I see.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2492.746,2494.036,--has been found appropriate.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.04,2503.411,"Of course they did just the same thing in Hitchcock against Dugger, did they?"
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2505.592,2508.594,"--In the sense, in the sense--"
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2508.594,2519.923,But they had... but the opinion... neither the opinion of the trial judge nor the opinion of the supreme court of Florida explains what weight if any was given to the evidence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2524.245,2524.906,"--Yes, it is."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.662,2582.754,That 30 percent figure wasn't true during the period 1982 to 1984?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2582.754,2583.094,--Right.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.161,2685.182,May I ask you one other question?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2685.182,2685.881,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.881,2706.783,Do... can you reconcile the court of appeals' statement in this case that the Florida... that the Federal court of appeals' statement in their opinion that referring to the Florida supreme court's opinion as saying that that court had concluded that the four statutory aggravating circumstances sufficiently outweighed the mitigating circumstances to justify the sentence.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2710.236,2719.403,"I think the Florida supreme... yes, and I think the Florida supreme court had six statutory aggravating factors that was before it with regard to what the trial court found."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.596,2748.772,"Let me, let me be sure I understand, because there are two quite different theories of what happened in the State's... one is that they found no nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, so obviously they would outweigh."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2766.534,2771.609,--I think that... I think that they took into consideration both statutory and nonstatutory.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.081,2786.509,So you presume that they found some nonstatutory circumstances... mitigating circumstances but found that they were outweighed by the aggravating?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2786.509,2804.608,I think what they did was they considered what the statutory... nonstatutory mitigating circumstances were tendered and they did the requisite determination as to what was presented and found it did not rise to the level that satisfied that the mitigation outweighed the aggravation in this case.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.51,2811.173,But is that because four outweighs... is greater than zero or because four is greater than two?
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2811.173,2812.823,"--No, the numbers don't matter."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.137,2825.142,But is it... but I still can't understand from your answer whether you think there were no nonstatutory mitigating circumstances found by the trial court or that they were found and found to be outweighed.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2825.142,2829.576,I think what... but again you're asking me something that I can't tell you--
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.576,2830.394,You can't tell from the record.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2830.394,2841.343,"--because it doesn't specifically speak to it, but I can tell... I can suggest to you that based on the instructions given, based on the evidence presented, we presume the trial court follows the law."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.56,2873.934,"There is no requirement that the record disclosed whether or not he considered it, we just presume he did."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2873.934,2882.84,"Absolutely, but we know... but the record requires and the... excuse me... the statutes and the case law requires you consider it and that's what we have to be concerned with."
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.735,2900.112,"No, it's not that you and I say yes or no, it's what... it's the fact that the Florida supreme court said one thing and the Federal court of appeals said they said something quite different as a basis for reversing the district court."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2901.221,2903.855,--But I think that they're getting at the same thing.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.224,2957.787,"But isn't it strange that when you read his opinion, the trial judge's opinion, he's in great detail about each one of the statutory mitigating circumstances with great elaboration of what the fact is."
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2961.08,2962.292,That's absolutely correct.
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.292,2963.962,It's a rather dramatic great contrast.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2963.962,2968.296,"But I think that is indicative of the period of time we're talking about also, because the statutes--"
1990.89-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.296,2971.068,Which is the period when some judges didn't think they had to even look at the nonstatutory.
1990.89-5961,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2971.068,2980.825,"--Yeah, no, what, what I was going to point to was the statute provide that you make written findings and the emphasis was at that point in time on the statutory mitigating factors."
1990.89-5961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.099,3077.279,"Thank you, Ms. Snurkowski."
1990.89-5961,2,39780,robert_j_link,,3079.423,3081.433,Please the Court.
1990.89-5961,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.39,3109.64,"Yes, but the law doesn't require the judge to believe it."
1990.89-5961,2,39780,robert_j_link,,3109.64,3116.595,"That is correct; however, the judge... the law requires the judge to consider it and there's no evidence that he did."
1990.89-5961,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.147,3151.39,"Thank you, Mr. Link."
