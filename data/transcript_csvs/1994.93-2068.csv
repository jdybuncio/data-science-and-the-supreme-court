1994.93-2068,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.428,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-2068, Brett C. Kimberlin v. J. Michael Quinlan."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,69.196,72.188,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-2068,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.354,173.135,Mr. Rosen... go ahead.
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,179.749,180.68,That's correct.
1994.93-2068,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.68,187.015,And an appeal was then taken by the defendants in the case to the CADC.
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,194.699,195.38,The--
1994.93-2068,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.38,198.793,Cohen didn't permit an appeal?
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,198.793,200.173,"--We did not raise that question, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.739,210.999,You're aware that we had a case argued here recently--
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,210.999,211.911,"--Yes, and I think that--"
1994.93-2068,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.911,223.767,"--that isn't too far removed from this, the Johnson case, and I just wondered what your position was on the... whether the CADC had appellate jurisdiction here."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,223.767,251.798,"--Our position is first, even though we didn't waive it... even though we didn't assert it it's not waived because it's a jurisdictional question, and secondly, that would be one way for this Court to resolve this case, to find that pursuant to the Court's decision in Johnson, whatever that may turn out to be, we find that there's no jurisdiction, there should have been jurisdiction by the court of appeals, therefore the district court's ruling which allowed the case to stay, allowed the case to proceed with discovery, would be reinstated."
1994.93-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.798,255.278,"Or more precisely, that would be a way for this Court not to resolve this case."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,259.62,261.25,"It's happened before, Your Honor, that's correct."
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.25,286.059,"Mr. Rosenblatt, would that be so if we were to say that there's no appellate jurisdiction because it doesn't come under the Mitchell-Cohen exception, then aren't we in effect saying that this kind of defense doesn't fit under qualified immunity, that what qualified immunity deals with is whether or not the law is clearly established?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,301.93,307.333,I think that would be an absolute legitimate reading of the Court's decision.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.84,329.008,"How could it not be, when the whole purpose of the lower courts exempting the special pleading rule and the direct evidence rule was to tie it into this qualified immunity?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,329.008,341.114,"--Well, my concern, Your Honor, is that advocates and judges may well decide that it's a part of qualified immunity, but it's not a part of qualified immunity that's immediately appealable, because this is all a balance that we're trying to reach."
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,341.114,346.509,"Well then, go back to the split qualified immunity that it was originally the intention of Harlow to get rid of."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,346.509,347.098,Right.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.359,350.871,"That would be quite an irony, to go that circle."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,350.871,353.001,"Right, and we don't think it's necessary."
1994.93-2068,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,353.833,369.675,"Are we supposed to address this without... I mean, I find this actually a rather difficult question, whether it's appealable or not, and we have another case that may shed some light, or may not, but there's no decision of the lower court on this issue, is there, and has it been fully briefed here?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,378.769,382.67,--I think the appealability issue has not been briefed below.
1994.93-2068,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,394.509,399.764,"So you'd like us both to say it's... we strike down the direct evidence rule and by the way, it wasn't appealable."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,399.764,400.382,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1994.93-2068,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,400.382,400.973,I realize--
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,400.973,401.514,--exactly right.
1994.93-2068,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,403.525,404.937,"--Yes, but I mean, that's not going to happen, so what should we do?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,407.389,407.799,No.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,430.442,438.487,"Then we get back to my question, but if you say that, then aren't you, in effect, saying it doesn't come within qualified immunity?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,438.487,460.262,"I think if we assume that all questions of qualified immunity are appealable, then we would be saying yes, this is not a question of qualified immunity, and therefore it's not an affirmative defense of the Federal officials, but we would have to make that assumption first that all questions that relate to qualified immunity are appealable for us to get that inference."
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.262,465.245,"You're familiar with the case that we heard last week, which was a question of, what happened?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,465.245,465.805,Yes.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.805,468.497,"And this is a case is, what's in an officer's head?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,468.497,469.468,Right.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.468,480.856,"Is the first case, what happened, did he do it, is that a qualified immunity defense when the officer says, I didn't do it, I wasn't there?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,480.856,483.708,It's our position that that is not a qualified immunity defense.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.289,486.86,"All right, how about this one?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,487.461,490.313,"--Well, in this one we also think that it's not part of qualified immunity."
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.989,500.688,This is an I-didn't-think-it.
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,500.688,502.49,"I didn't think it, but--"
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.49,525.716,"Now, if an I-didn't-think-it defense is just like an I-didn't-do-it defense, then neither of them come within qualified immunity, but you hesitated, and it's interesting that you did, because it seems to me the courts of appeals are doing exactly that, having much more difficulty categorizing, characterizing the I-didn't-think-it than they had with I-didn't-do-it."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,525.716,528.077,"--Well, they're trying to strike an appropriate balance here."
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.973,585.843,Why isn't it the same for the I-didn't-do-it?
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,585.843,595.26,"Well, the I-didn't-do-it, the way I understood it, was more the ultimate question to be decided, and in fact if this Court or if the lower courts had--"
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.26,598.652,"Well, isn't whether I thought it also is the ultimate question?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,598.652,600.215,--It is the ultimate question.
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.802,633.054,"What are your views on the merits of the issues that are here, Mr. Rosenblatt?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,633.054,641.091,"Well, we think that the direct evidence rule versus circumstantial evidence rule is contrary to this Court's consistent precedent."
1994.93-2068,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.222,761.399,"You're... I assume you would make the same arguments against a heightened pleading rule as opposed to a direct evidence rule, but would you like to address the latter?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,778.359,779.691,To allow the heightened pleading rule?
1994.93-2068,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.446,873.532,"This is in the... at the summary judgment, early discovery phase, rather than the filing of the complaint, I assume?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,873.532,874.883,Right.
1994.93-2068,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.841,889.033,By requesting affidavits as part of a summary judgment proceeding?
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,889.033,898.089,"Well, we believe that this Court has made clear that this determination should take place before discovery, and so this is--"
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,898.089,901.7,"You're talking about a more definite statement, like... 12 being a more definite statement."
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,901.7,907.115,"--That's exactly right, and it would have to be viewed in the early context of the case in which there is no discovery."
1994.93-2068,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,913.928,915.45,Is that consistent with Rule 9?
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,915.45,933.743,"It is, Your Honor, because Rule 9 says what has to be in a complaint, and that the only heightened pleading that's permissible are for cases of fraud, and so we think that it would be consistent with 9(b), because this is something that would go on during the motion practice."
1994.93-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.699,958.658,"Mr. Rosenblatt, don't you exaggerate it somewhat by saying that although there's an interest in law enforcement officers acting fearlessly, there's also an interest in preventing their violating clearly established rights?"
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,1008.62,1010.343,"We absolutely agree with that, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.025,1053.881,But to what extent is Liberty Lobby on the intent phase colored by the fact that it's a libel case?
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,1053.881,1069.431,"It was a libel case which gave even more protection to the defendants, and we think that that actually draws a nice parallel, because we are looking... we do have policy reasons to protect the defendants in this case, and so for that reason we think that they're very close."
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1108.327,1109.959,Can you be concrete about this case?
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,1119.835,1120.966,"--Right, and it--"
1994.93-2068,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.966,1122.887,He has an affidavit that says that.
1994.93-2068,0,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,1126.379,1131.234,"--Let me just point out, there is no affidavit like that, but that's certainly their position."
1994.93-2068,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.573,1179.086,"Very well, Mr. Rosenblatt."
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1181.026,1190.843,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-2068,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1255.024,1260.779,But you don't get up to the court of appeals ordinarily just because the district court decided a question of law wrong.
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1260.779,1262.248,--I agree completely.
1994.93-2068,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1271.253,1274.736,You have to characterize it as a qualified immunity defense.
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1286.417,1301.374,"--Well, our argument in Johnson was that the qualified immunity defense is there to protect people who did not violate clearly established constitutional rights, so you can state the qualified immunity by saying, an official who did not violate clearly established constitutional rights has qualified immunity."
1994.93-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.525,1304.816,If your argument was that I didn't do it is a qualified immunity.
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1304.816,1305.687,"--Yes, right."
1994.93-2068,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1384.698,1398.309,"Well, cases where the allegation just turns on the so-called improper motive of the official seem to be cases that, as others have pointed out, are very easily brought."
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1398.309,1399.338,--Right.
1994.93-2068,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.338,1403.611,And difficult to deal with factually.
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1411.877,1433.15,"Our view is consistent with the views of, I think, seven circuits that have looked at this question, and that is that the Court ought to adopt a standard requiring specific allegations of the basis for the claim of unconstitutional motive before you go to the discovery stage of the case."
1994.93-2068,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.5,1451.093,"Well, what rule do you tie it to?"
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1454.216,1458.486,--I think there are a couple of rules that provide a basis for it.
1994.93-2068,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1493.499,1493.98,"Well, must."
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1497.554,1502.865,"--In a... yes, in a clear case, it would be an abuse of discretion not to, right."
1994.93-2068,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.36,1558.201,"Could you take it as the pleading defendant pleads, as the defendant, qualified immunity, and that is taken automatically as... a court in sum says that's automatically a statement, a motion for a more definite statement unless the complaint is already sufficient?"
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1558.201,1559.563,"Right, yes."
1994.93-2068,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1559.563,1560.565,And can we do that?
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1560.565,1561.684,I think you can do that.
1994.93-2068,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.658,1579.466,"You'd say the plea of qualified immunity is taken as a matter of law to be a motion for a more definite statement, which must be satisfied unless the complaint is sufficiently detailed."
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1581.008,1586.982,"--Again, I see no reason why you could not do that, so I think there are at least three different bases--"
1994.93-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.982,1588.541,"--26(b)(2), is that what you said?"
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1588.541,1591.103,"--Yes, (b)(2)(iii), I think, which talks about the--"
1994.93-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.103,1592.305,"(b)(3), okay."
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1594.405,1602.45,"--(b)(2), and then there's (iii), which talks about the judge dealing with the burdens of discovery."
1994.93-2068,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1670.945,1682.923,"--That overlay would come from the substantive rule about the qualified immunity protection, because otherwise averments in an answer are deemed... automatically deemed denied or avoided--"
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1682.923,1683.584,--Right.
1994.93-2068,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1683.584,1688.277,"--and here it was suggested that we have just the opposite, automatic... automatic assumption."
1994.93-2068,1,37685,paul_bender,,1691.328,1714.884,"Right, and you must answer it with enough specificity to justify going forward, and I think you're right that that comes from the desire of the defense of qualified immunity to not have people forced to go through discovery on insubstantial claims, and that it is worthwhile testing whether the claim is substantial or not as early in the process as possible by that kind of automatic motion for a more definite statement, yes."
1994.93-2068,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.013,1760.805,"Thank you, Mr. Bender."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,1763.066,1766.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.724,1932.237,"But Mr. Martinez, wouldn't that just go against what really Harlow was trying to do?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,1979.779,1990.154,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and it's precisely for that reason, and numerous courts have examined that Harlow... the question of whether Harlow could be read that broadly."
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.211,2003.393,I thought you were quarreling with that and said that Harlow could be read that broadly--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2003.393,2004.004,"No, I was--"
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.004,2005.084,--to take out all consideration of--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2005.084,2006.426,--I was not quarreling with that.
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.492,2046.314,--Do we have authority to do that?
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2056.221,2063.004,"Your Honor, in this context... Justice Scalia, in this context the authority for doing that is a couple of things."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.9,2087.38,"Well, why... I mean, specific responses."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2104.093,2116.39,"Well, I... Your Honor, I think the answer to the question is that it stems from the very strong message that this Court has sent in Harlow and cases after Harlow that we do not want to get into motive."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.687,2149.581,--What other instances do you have where we have created such... without any statutory authority such heightened standards of proof or of pleading?
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2149.581,2161.288,"Well, Your Honor, the other examples where those kind of standards apply, which we've mentioned in our brief, would include fraud cases, would include conspiracy allegations--"
1994.93-2068,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.288,2163.401,But those are in the Federal rules--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2164.751,2165.572,--Fraud cases are.
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.025,2174.668,"What do you refer to... the conspiracy allegations are what, where--"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2174.668,2176.339,--When... that--
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.339,2178.91,"--Is that in our cases, or in the courts of appeals?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2178.91,2182.313,"--Your Honor, I believe it's primarily in the courts of appeals."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.313,2184.846,"I think it's only in the courts of appeals, unless I'm mistaken."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2184.846,2186.807,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.43,2213.223,"Why is... I thought circumstantial is sometimes stronger than direct, direct is sometimes stronger than circumstantial."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2213.223,2214.295,"We don't quibble with that, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.943,2244.153,"But I mean, that's quite different."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2259.924,2260.846,"--No, I don't believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.268,2293.848,It's only objective--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2293.848,2294.359,--because he has not violated--
1994.93-2068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.359,2294.93,--Well--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2297.422,2299.743,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.743,2301.846,"If it's a pretext, is it objectively reasonable?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2301.846,2329.291,"It's... Your Honor, when you couple the fact here with the fact that he did not... the respondents did not violate any clearly established law, and on an objective view of this record did not violate an official's... did not violate Mr. Kimberlin's constitutional rights, on an objective view, setting aside motive for a moment, he's clearly entitled to qualified immunity, and that's what Harlow says."
1994.93-2068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.291,2330.023,"Well, if there was no motive--"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2330.023,2330.463,Now--
1994.93-2068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.463,2332.343,"--If there was no motive whatsoever, they couldn't have done this."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2340.979,2343.373,"--There were reasons, but the reason is different from motive."
1994.93-2068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.592,2372.073,Go to the second one.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2372.912,2389.925,"The second one was that Director Quinlan was informed that evening that a national reporter had reported to the Director of Public Affairs, Mr. Miller, at the Department of Justice, that the petitioner feared his life was in danger."
1994.93-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.674,2409.867,--There's disagreement about the motive with which that was done.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2420.856,2422.356,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief--"
1994.93-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.356,2426.219,And you're saying that that simply cannot be inquired into in a case like this?
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2426.219,2427.661,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.01,2468.677,"But you've always got a... I won't say always, but in many cases you have a claim that this was perfectly proper to have done to this individual so long as you treated other people similarly situated the same way, but if you just made kind of a totally different regime for one person that was much harsher than for another, then you may have a constitutional violation just based on that, and you say that can't be inquired into."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2468.677,2473.632,"--No, Your Honor, I would agree that could be inquired into, but that's not the circumstances of this case."
1994.93-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2478.735,2479.316,But still--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2479.316,2485.06,"When you look at these facts, he was acting... the respondents were acting objectively reasonable."
1994.93-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.283,2542.335,"--Well, Mr. Martinez, but for the CADC heightened evidence standard, this thing would proceed to trial on the basis of circumstantial evidence, and would you care to comment on this Court's holding in Leatherman, handed down in 1993, where we made it pretty clear that as a matter of policy you might make an argument to have some other rule, but unless the Federal rules authorized the imposition of heightened standards, the courts don't have the authority to adopt them."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2542.335,2543.577,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2543.577,2549.552,That certainly points in a direction against support of the CADC requirement.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2549.552,2553.462,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I would disagree with that statement."
1994.93-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2580.57,2584.784,"Yes, but I'm talking about the whole thrust of the Leatherman opinion."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2593.81,2596.111,"--Well, Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree."
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2651.006,2676.574,"Do I understand that your argument, that its root is that the reason this case does not come within Leatherman is that there is a general proposition of immunity law that we should not, in fact, tolerate any more... any further causes of action than absolutely necessary if those causes of action require an inquiry into motive?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2680.386,2681.627,Primarily I would agree with that--
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2681.627,2682.298,All right.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2682.298,2683.037,"--Justice Souter, yes."
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2683.037,2702.3,"And I thought your reason was precedent, but Justice Ginsburg pointed out, and you agree, that in fact the only sense in which this Court eliminated the inquiry into motive was as a general characteristic or element of qualified immunity."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2714.909,2715.949,Well--
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2715.949,2717.351,I thought you agreed with it when Justice Ginsburg--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2717.351,2719.371,"--I do agree with that, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2719.371,2719.772,--All right.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2736.261,2737.032,"No, it--"
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2737.032,2756.136,"Because there are some causes of action, you admit, that do involve motive, and we can and should inquire into them, and if that is the case, then what is the justification for a heightened pleading requirement, let alone in an unqualified immunity case, let alone a direct evidence requirement?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2756.136,2767.794,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it boils down again to a reading of Harlow and what this Court meant when it wrote Harlow and when it wrote its subsequent decisions."
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2768.485,2770.896,But I thought you just agreed with Justice Ginsburg's reading of Harlow.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2770.896,2773.118,"--That's correct, but--"
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2773.118,2774.806,Which leaves you without much to go on.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2774.806,2776.769,"--Well, I would disagree, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2778.049,2784.043,"Mr. Martinez, maybe we can take it in the context of a concrete example that you yourself gave, Davis v. Passman."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2784.043,2784.424,--Yes.
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.424,2805.187,"A Member of Congress says, I fire one of my staff members, and if that's done for a reason like inefficiency, or downsizing, it's perfectly all right, but if he says, I fire you because we need a man for this job, then it's unconstitutional."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2805.187,2807.229,"That is correct, Your Honor, and in--"
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2807.229,2810.143,You gave that as an example of a case where motive counts.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2813.111,2850.638,"--But that was the... that is a just... we gave that as an example, Justice Ginsburg, as a case that supports the notion that the application of the direct versus circumstantial rule does not weed out all cases, and that is correct, if you're going to have a rule that permits... that opens the door slightly to motive-based cases going forward in this context, then Davis v. Passman is such a case, because Congressman Passman in that case wrote a letter to the plaintiff, Mrs. Davis, saying we don't want to hire you because we've got enough women already."
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2850.638,2853.039,That's where... you had a self-confession.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2868.199,2898.099,"Well, Your Honor, it's not my heightened evidence rule, but the answer is, I would say yes, there are... I would think that any statements made by witnesses, if you had someone who perhaps overheard a statement made by the defendant, I think there are other situations, clearly, where direct evidence would come up in a manner that might be other than a written letter like you had in Davis v. Passman, but--"
1994.93-2068,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2898.099,2926.767,"And yet that letter might be, if the case went to trial, it might be a southern gentleman's way of saying something that he thought was a kindness, and that in fact was not discriminatory, and in other cases you might have somebody who was rampantly discriminating because of a person's sex or race, but is very good at using the right words, you could never prove it out of that person's mouth, and you say one case goes to trial, and the other one doesn't?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2926.767,2942.598,"--Well, Your Honor, you have to draw the line somewhere, otherwise you're getting back to the notion we had pre-Harlow, where you had extensive inquiries into motive on the part of plaintiffs suing Government officials in their individual capacities."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.598,2947.801,"Mr. Martinez, I assume that direct evidence of intent always has to be a confession."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2950.162,2950.663,I--
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.663,2951.792,--isn't that the direct evidence?
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2959.709,2963.372,"--I can't think of any, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.191,2964.962,It's inside a person's head.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2964.962,2966.144,--that's essentially correct.
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.144,2967.214,"Either he utters it, or you don't know it directly."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,2967.214,2968.706,That's essentially correct.
1994.93-2068,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2968.706,2969.146,Yes.
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3022.17,3024.491,"Well, I'd certainly agree with that wholeheartedly, Justice Breyer."
1994.93-2068,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3024.922,3025.392,"I know, but I just--"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3026.131,3029.914,And that's the whole point.
1994.93-2068,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3034.376,3046.665,"What's worrying about the argument is, does this Court actually have the power just to write an opinion that says that, or does it have to refer the matter to the rules committee, or does it have to ask the SG to bring it up when he's on such a committee?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3070.591,3071.101,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.685,3085.2,"Well, to some extent, you know, you're perhaps too polite to make the argument, but Justice Breyer's concern is certainly reduced in the case of Bivens."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3093.445,3094.567,I think that's exactly--
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.567,3102.51,"That wouldn't extend to 1983, and it would be rather strange to treat Bivens actions different from 1983 actions."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3102.51,3103.942,"--I think, Justice Scalia--"
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.942,3105.174,"But in a pinch you'd take it, I betcha."
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3105.174,3105.973,"--Yes, sir."
1994.93-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.805,3107.736,Let me suggest--
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3107.736,3124.897,"I think, Justice Scalia, to answer your question, you're right, since Bivens was a doctrine created by this Court, you certainly could create that as an effort to counterbalance or respond to the problem that has arisen out of the creation of the Bivens doctrine."
1994.93-2068,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3124.897,3132.34,"--Well, has the problem... I mean, we're concerned with that kind of thing as judges, but outside the D.C. Circuit, has the paper been piling up?"
1994.93-2068,2,36371,michael_l_martinez,,3134.702,3149.621,"I believe it has, Your Honor, but that's not in the record, and I don't have any figures to point to other than, the only figures that are in the record are the Solicitor General noted in his brief that I believe for the years 1993 and 1994--"
1994.93-2068,3,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,3413.764,3416.296,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-2068,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3445.257,3455.292,"Why does the D.C. Court of Appeals feel impelled to invent this special pleading rule, heightened evidence rule?"
1994.93-2068,3,27932,howard_t_rosenblatt,,3455.292,3460.627,"Well, it's clearly the case that there are two interests here to be balanced."
1994.93-2068,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.724,3473.315,"Thank you, Mr. Rosenblatt."
