2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.254,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa Crociere, S. p. A. Mr. Bendure."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,8.254,17.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case revolves around Rule 15(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.699,61.538,"Do you know, Mr. Bendure, what exactly the corporate relationship was between the two?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,61.538,64.489,"No, Your Honor, not the corporate relation."
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,96.109,98.144,Thank you.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,98.144,107.849,"Because of that timely service on Costa Cruise, we satisfied the first subsection."
2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,119.74,124.128,"Counsel, your -- your client tripped over the cable, right?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,124.128,124.544,Correct.
2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,124.544,129.246,What if the case were there were two people behind her and she was pushed?
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,147.291,153.128,"If you're talking about a lack of knowledge of the real name, probably--"
2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,153.128,154.063,Not just the real name.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,172.858,179.695,"--I would say yes, because -- again, assuming that all of the other criteria are satisfied."
2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,179.695,180.462,Yes.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,182.897,183.131,Yes.
2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,183.131,183.749,--and everything else.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,187.617,197.889,"It's -- it's obviously a slightly different and more difficult case from our perspective, but what I think is critical is the status that's involved."
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,209.946,213.064,What was the first -- when was your first notice of that?
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,226.138,229.49,It was -- we say that was the first notice.
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.586,259.342,"Well, you don't -- I didn't understand you to deny that the ticket made it very clear who operated the ship."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,259.342,261.711,--I'm not sure--
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.711,262.827,Do you contest that?
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,262.827,274.101,"--I contest that it makes it very clear, but I don't contest that one could conclude that that provided constructive notice, that if read carefully one might infer."
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.101,275.051,"Well, why not?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,278.82,281.772,"Well, actually it was under definitions."
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.461,299.048,So you are -- you either are contesting or you're not contesting that it's clear from the ticket.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,300.964,303.765,--I'm not -- I am not agreeing that it's clear.
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.855,315.64,So you had -- so then you had notice even before the suit was filed.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,317.056,320.858,"We had what the circuit court referred to as ""imputed knowledge""."
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,323.394,330.214,Did the -- did the name show up any place other than page 1 of the general conditions of passage?
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,330.214,332.1,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.1,334.466,That's -- and this is what?
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,337.751,340.218,"It's an 11-page, small print document."
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.149,388.349,Not -- not if you read the definitions on page 1.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,398.289,419.803,"--Well, it -- well, under the same definition, the steward would be a carrier every bit as much as Costa Crociere, S. p. A. So it seems to me by that reasoning you could conclude that the steward or the janitor is the vessel operator because they are likewise defined as the carrier in that definitional section."
2009.09-337,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.171,487.013,"Let me -- I've been thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or two people fired the shotgun, and there's only one pellet, and you don't know which gun the pellet came from."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,513.664,523.603,"Well, actually when it talks of mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of mistake connotes error."
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,572.267,572.617,Counsel--
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,572.617,573.933,Certainly.
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,573.933,589.359,"--assume I accept your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me, but -- I think."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,620.978,622.497,I think--
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,622.497,638.257,"And I think that's what the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period, wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed to act?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,638.257,640.876,--Let me respond both legally and factually.
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,684.088,686.607,That makes so little sense to me.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,704.234,705.051,Correct.
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,705.051,705.701,All right.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,707.717,708.301,Okay.
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,708.301,733.452,"--what the lower court said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong party and you continued in that action, that that's what you intended to do, to sue that wrong party."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,733.452,736.904,Let me point out factually -- and I did not stress it in my brief.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.762,806.131,"--Mr. Bendure, would you explain one factual matter to me?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,813.785,813.985,--It had.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.57,820.474,So when the answer was filed it was too late for you to come within the statute of limitations.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,820.474,821.308,Absolutely true.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,821.308,833.381,"And I thought that would be the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, because when you got the answer -- which was filed after how many days?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,833.381,838.785,It was filed I think 24 days after the complaint.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,838.785,843.487,"If you had gotten that a few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we wouldn't be here."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,843.487,844.839,"That's certainly true, Your Honor."
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,845.989,846.523,I'm sorry.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,851.327,852.027,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,857.914,858.281,Right.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,858.281,862.968,It -- 120 days after the amended complaint is our time for service of the amended--
2009.09-337,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,862.968,863.518,Complaint.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,863.518,864.669,--complaint on the new defendant.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,912.983,920.154,But the basic point is the answer didn't come in until you were already out under the statute of limitations.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,920.154,920.604,--Correct.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.604,930.029,"So from their point of view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,930.029,935.33,"We could do nothing to, as a matter of right, file within the limitation period."
2009.09-337,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.33,943.317,Did your amended complaint contain any new and material allegations other than the name correction?
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,943.317,952.44,"It actually was a second count, but it was the same allegations against Costa Crociere that had been made against Costa Cruise."
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.527,1018.648,"I thought that the only condition was that it had to arise out of the same event or transaction, which would give you much more running room than -- than what you assert."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1018.648,1022.116,--Only if you're amending against the same defendant.
2009.09-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1032.956,1061.825,"Mr. Bendure, in addition to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the ticket came; it said ""Costa Cruise"" -- were there any other connections between the plaintiff passenger and Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope that says ""Costa Cruise""?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1061.825,1080.537,"There was the -- the pre-suit claims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the Florida address, in attempted compliance with the provision of the ticket which says you must file notice to the carrier before filing suit."
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.347,1164.191,"Mr. Bendure, can -- can I come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it seems to me you're giving too narrow an interpretation, and I would not like our opinion to read any more narrowly than the statute allows."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1206.316,1209.018,--There's no question we satisfy that.
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.818,1210.804,I understand that.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1216.021,1216.854,Because I'm forced to--
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.854,1218.238,It seems to me you're home free with (B).
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1218.238,1220.988,"--Unfortunately, (C) then goes on and says:"
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.658,1230.312,"Oh, yes, but -- but those are the only things we -- we have to argue about."
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1230.312,1230.862,--That's correct.
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.862,1238.049,"There's no doubt that you are asserting -- even if you were asserting a different claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or event, didn't it?"
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1238.049,1238.582,Certainly.
2009.09-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.934,1240.484,Okay.
2009.09-337,0,35542,mark_r_bendure,,1240.484,1245.737,"If the Court doesn't have any additional questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."
2009.09-337,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1245.737,1246.837,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1252.558,1270.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are, we suggest, two issues before the Court: The first is the legal question of whether a plaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper party can preclude a finding that there was a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.979,1286.696,Mr. Glazier--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.696,1289.664,"It's no mistake if you happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right party is?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1289.664,1290.616,Correct.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.932,1291.466,Ever?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1291.466,1292.466,--Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.466,1297.036,Have you ever driven a car where your wife has said turn left and you've turned right?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1299.388,1300.655,Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1300.655,1301.872,Was there anything you didn't know?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1301.872,1304.424,"What the facts are here, Your Honor--"
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.424,1306.976,"No, I'm asking about this question, my hypothetical."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1306.976,1307.259,--You know--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1307.842,1310.261,Was there anything you didn't know?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1310.261,1311.544,There is nothing that you did not know.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.544,1311.827,Correct.
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.235,1323.735,I think your wife made a mistake.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1326.637,1328.989,"--No, my wife does not make mistakes."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1329.839,1331.924,I think--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.924,1338.078,"I make mistakes, and sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so do you and so does everybody else."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1351.802,1355.27,--Where -- in three different times the plaintiff was informed of the facts.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.02,1357.186,That's a different matter.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1362.507,1362.924,--Well--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.924,1364.357,So that's a different matter.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1369.059,1372.527,--The circuit court refers -- talks about imputed knowledge.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1381.717,1383.819,I just want the citations to the page.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1386.752,1387.035,--There are--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.035,1396.257,"--where there's a finding that, in fact, he knew that this company called ""Costa Cruise"" in Italian is the same as the company called ""Costa Cruise"" in English?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1399.309,1401.911,--They are -- they're separate corporations.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.911,1402.244,"Yes, yes."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1417.087,1419.154,They are separate corporations.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.373,1420.789,I didn't ask you that question.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1435.798,1440.619,--There is a finding--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.619,1441.302,I'll write them down and look at them later.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1441.302,1445.654,--The finding on page 19a of the district court opinion says--
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.654,1447.873,19a of the petition?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1447.873,1450.323,--19a of the cert petition says
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.858,1456.727,"I thought what the district court said was ""impute"" the knowledge."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1456.727,1457.227,No.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.297,1463.63,Where does it say that?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1465.763,1468.832,"--19a -- it's not precisely it, but it says,"
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1474.936,1475.605,"Well, I -- I know."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1491.864,1492.414,--Your Honor--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1492.414,1497.018,"Now, all I want is some citation from you that shows that isn't what they thought."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1497.018,1501.303,"--Well, the best I can do is the conclusion that there is not a mistake."
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1501.986,1508.307,"Well, that's the conclusion, and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have had constructive knowledge."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1516.146,1516.829,--I'd like to--
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.829,1517.129,I'm sorry.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1519.098,1520.814,I'm on page 19a.
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.814,1521.114,--Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.383,1524.8,Constructive notice.
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.8,1528.369,"--by -- by the defendant, not constructive knowledge by the--"
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.369,1528.452,All right.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1537.391,1541.86,--The -- there -- there is not that sentence--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.86,1542.543,Okay.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1542.543,1542.943,--in the opinion.
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1557.267,1582.568,"--Is there any other than that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing envelopes that she got that say ""Costa Cruise"" -- is there anything in the entire record other than that definition page that includes carrier, that includes steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a different corporation?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1582.568,1584.436,--There are three different pieces of evidence.
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.523,1593.708,--It says it includes stewards.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1595.158,1595.825,--I'm sorry.
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.244,1600.629,"It includes the stewards on the boat, according to your -- your friend."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1600.629,1605.265,"--It lists one entity by name, Costa Crociere, and lists others by role."
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1607.365,1613.019,So why can't Costa Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1613.019,1625.077,"--Well, one might argue that there might be a number of different entities that might be a carrier, but there is only one entity which is clearly the carrier, indisputably a carrier--"
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1625.077,1627.677,What is the relationship between those corporations?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1627.677,1633.247,"--Costa Crociere is, I believe, one level removed an owner of Costa Cruise Lines."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1640.087,1642.437,"But are they -- are they sister corporations, a parent-sub--"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1642.437,1642.653,--No.
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.653,1643.039,--or what?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1643.039,1651.894,"Costa Crociere is parent, and I believe there's a corporation below them, and then that corporation owns Costa Cruise Lines."
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1651.894,1656.596,"When it's below them, you mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary company?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1656.596,1656.846,Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1656.846,1662.85,"You know, the -- the definition of carrier includes independent contractors."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1677.593,1682.295,"There might be more than one carrier, but there is one carrier identified by name."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.984,1699.086,And if you went to--
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1699.086,1699.436,"Now, there is no--"
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1699.436,1714.513,"--If you went to the Web site, which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab that says ""Our ships"" ""Our ships"" -- and one of those ships is Costa Magica, whatever."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1714.513,1714.946,--Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.946,1722.536,"""Our ships"", and it identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1739.228,1743.532,What -- what -- the relationship between the parties was governed by the ticket.
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1758.273,1773.782,"So it shouldn't matter that this confusion was caused in large part by this entity that advertises in English under the name ""Costa Cruise"" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1781.971,1785.673,"--We -- we believe that the ticket is clear, and that governs."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.83,1802.299,And the answer is filed conveniently after the 1-year period has run.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1802.299,1813.671,"--The answer is filed, but the question of whether the defendant knew or should have known that there -- it -- it would have been sued but for a mistake, the inquiry there is not within the limitations period."
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1817.325,1820.844,"Well, but I don't -- I mean, there's some sharp practice going on here."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1837.203,1837.57,Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.57,1838.153,Okay.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1849.859,1853.079,The statute of limitations is not the measuring period.
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1866.819,1872.537,Did the answer say the statute -- the 1-year period has run?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1875.056,1880.608,--It was not raised in the -- in the defense -- it was not raised as defense in the answer.
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.793,1885.095,When was it raised as a defense?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1885.095,1894.95,"It was raised 10 weeks later in a motion for summary judgment, which was still within the Rule 4(m) period, and that is the crucial period."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.585,1902.704,But that -- the Rule 4(m) period concerns when you can serve.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1914.262,1923.784,"--Well, the Rule 4(m) period is awfully important because Rule 15(c) turns on, since 1991, on the Rule (4)(m) period."
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.328,1960.004,"Now, that -- that assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii), 4(m)."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,1976.965,1977.415,Well--
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.415,1987.537,And you're relying on the fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry -- that -- that you filed an answer which made it very clear to them what the situation was.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2001.031,2005.149,"--The answer, we submit, is no."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.193,2035.066,"Where -- where is the defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed within 1 year of the date of any alleged injury."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2041.82,2046.374,"--In the motion for summary judgment, which -- which is not in the joint appendix."
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.553,2071.838,"Yes, but--"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2071.838,2072.588,--but there was no change.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.588,2083.463,"--being realistic about it, as I understand it you're relying entirely on the condition, general conditions of passage in the ticket, the fine print describing the term ""carrier""."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2096.871,2097.987,The--
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.987,2103.275,"Don't you think, looking at that ticket, if you were a passenger you would think you were doing business with Costa Cruise?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2103.275,2104.709,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.709,2105.492,Just looking at the cover?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2105.492,2106.876,--If what--
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.876,2111.696,"Am I correct that on the cover of the ticket, the Italian name isn't used at all?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2111.696,2114.612,"--On the cover, the Italian name is not used."
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.648,2116.448,And isn't that what the--
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2116.448,2116.964,--is Costa Cruise Lines.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.964,2120.885,"--what the passenger would normally look at, understand who he is doing business with?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2120.885,2125.937,"If one were to not read the ticket, which on page 1--"
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.937,2131.574,Assuming -- assuming the lawyer would just look at the cover before he files a lawsuit?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2131.574,2141.029,"--We know -- if this were a question of uncertainty whether the lawyer read the ticket, that would be one thing, but we know that the lawyer read the ticket."
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.029,2144.667,"Well, I don't understand what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this question."
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.667,2146.933,Because the question is whether the lawyer made a mistake.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2147.869,2148.335,Well--
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.335,2149.152,And he did make a mistake.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2149.152,2159.51,"--The principle is if one knows what the true facts are -- if one knows what the true facts are and proceeds in any event, then there's no mistake concerning the--"
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.51,2160.477,"That isn't true, is it?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2184.725,2184.908,--Well--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2184.908,2186.844,And there's even a fortiori--
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2186.844,2187.81,--Your Honor--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2187.81,2189.946,"--if he doesn't know, even if he should."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2189.946,2190.996,--We have--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.996,2191.529,Isn't that true?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2191.529,2197.45,--What we have up front is the -- the ticket.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.0,2213.791,"What possible reason is there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2213.791,2214.675,--The plaintiff--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.675,2215.66,Is there such a reason?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2215.66,2221.814,--The evidence in the record is that the plaintiff's lawyer looked at the Web site and chose a United States corporation instead of--
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.814,2224.064,"And I'm just saying, did he do it by mistake?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2234.539,2240.609,"--Well, if it were -- if I had to sue Costa Crociere through the Hague Convention in Genoa, maybe a lawyer--"
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.609,2255.084,"Well, I want to ask you about that, because in your brief you refer in your footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal Government 44101-44103."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2312.455,2313.989,--I cannot answer the question now.
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.989,2323.095,"Well then, were you correct when you said in your -- in your brief that this company which you represent does comply with 44103?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2323.095,2326.813,"My understanding is the answer is yes, but I cannot address the specific question."
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.197,2340.556,"It is relevant, I think, because it adds to the confusion if they are under a legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but they don't have it printed on the ticket."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2354.38,2355.482,"--But the question, though--"
2009.09-337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.482,2355.999,It seems odd.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2358.684,2372.575,"--Well, the question is not a more generalized blame explanation, but under the rule, the language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2393.088,2396.39,--But we -- let's clarify that point now.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2460.712,2469.818,"But if -- if, during the 120-day period -- you know, the Rule 15(c) happens to rely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial point."
2009.09-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2484.245,2487.78,"Yes, but the relation back is different from the point at which the statute has run."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2501.604,2502.32,--Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2506.803,2507.588,Why does that even matter?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2530.084,2531.834,--If--
2009.09-337,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2531.834,2537.238,Where do you see in -- the question on which cert was granted has to do with imputed knowledge.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2547.824,2550.943,--We do not rely at all upon imputed knowledge.
2009.09-337,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2553.793,2559.965,"Well, where -- just -- where do you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the reasonableness of the mistake?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2566.619,2577.158,The rule contemplates by its structure that the mistake will be the cause of the reason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties.
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.158,2578.491,That's not what the rule says.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2592.965,2594.334,Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2594.334,2600.837,"You know cruise -- the other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, correct?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2600.837,2601.987,We--
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2601.987,2604.872,So it's either a factual or a legal mistake.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2608.859,2609.643,--And then--
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2609.643,2633.209,"Because -- then have you to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What conceivable reason that is not either negligence or unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity, however you want to define it, that someone who is injured would want to name a party who wasn't responsible for the injury?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2633.209,2645.516,"--The most powerful evidence is simply when they were informed of the claimed mistake, they did nothing for 95 days to indicate in any manner whatsoever that it was a mistake."
2009.09-337,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2646.066,2650.484,"Well, that's evidence from which the absence of a mistake might be inferred."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2654.705,2659.674,"--Well, this -- whether something is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue."
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2669.113,2680.588,"But, counsel, don't -- what you're really talking about is whether once the answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their motion."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2713.892,2716.677,"--Well, delay in moving to amend via 15(a)."
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2726.966,2733.888,Is there anything in the face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a mistake?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2743.161,2746.363,"--Yes, I believe there is."
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2763.639,2754.533,Where does it say that?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2764.856,2766.424,The complaint certainly does not say that.
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2766.59,2773.328,"What the complaint says is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, injured me, correct?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2773.328,2774.111,--It says that the--
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2774.111,2776.53,And is that an accurate statement of fact?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2776.53,2779.648,--That -- it's not an accurate statement of fact.
2009.09-337,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2779.648,2780.632,So--
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.632,2783.684,"No, I would have said the previous paragraph, 9, says:"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2789.603,2790.039,Right.
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2803.78,2804.313,"Now, which is it?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2805.682,2806.249,--No.
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2809.017,2809.201,Just a mistake.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2809.751,2813.905,--We're not -- we are not disputing the notice issue.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.457,2822.159,"Despite that, they made a mistake."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2822.159,2824.194,--they have decided to sue Costa Cruise Lines.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.194,2824.694,"They made a mistake, right?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2827.127,2827.996,No.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.996,2828.512,What?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2828.512,2829.629,We don't think so.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.629,2831.447,Why isn't -- why doesn't the rule cover it?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2831.447,2831.697,"But, again, if we move past--"
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.697,2846.973,"I object to your relying upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2871.805,2876.309,"--I understand what you're saying, but there's nothing in -- just the point--"
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.309,2883.23,"And the -- the only thing you could rely on for that short period before the answer is filed is simply the ticket, right?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2883.23,2897.722,--There's nothing in the rule -- the ticket and the complaint -- there's nothing in the rule that says that only events up to point of the running of the limitations period or the service of the answer are relevant.
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.405,2903.19,"Well, you are reading ""within the period"" to mean ""throughout the period""."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2905.906,2910.694,"--Well, the district court, which is serving as the fact-finder there, looked at all the evidence."
2009.09-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2915.748,2918.45,I think it's an important issue with respect to the statute.
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.954,2931.172,"I have one -- one question about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture on it."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2938.761,2944.248,--I -- I don't know the answer to that.
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2944.248,2945.181,Pardon me.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2945.181,2947.033,I don't know the answer at this time.
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2947.033,2952.604,"I -- I make the assumption that it's the cruise line, Crociere, that got the award."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2961.46,2971.399,"I -- Your Honor -- clearly, as you said, Costa Crociere is the vessel operator."
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2975.868,2979.754,"How many -- if you have a 1,000-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2979.754,2981.454,"--Here, you only have to read one."
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2981.454,2982.873,But this is the first one.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2982.873,2983.556,"Well, this is--"
2009.09-337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2983.556,2986.325,"The one I pointed out to you with the mistake, that's the first one."
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,2986.325,2987.525,--It's -- it's on the cover.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.517,3041.04,"I'm still puzzled, because Rule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of the defendant, correct?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3044.159,3045.492,--Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.492,3051.998,"And is it not true that under (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the action, would not be prejudiced?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3053.681,3053.865,Yes.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.865,3062.187,"And is it also true that at the time they received the complaint, they knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against the carrier instead of the broker?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3062.187,3064.306,The answer--
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.306,3066.508,I just don't understand how you get around the plain language.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3066.508,3072.661,"--Our answer is no, and especially considering, within the events, they don't show that there's--"
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.661,3079.332,You don't think -- you don't think that the agent didn't realize that they would have sued the carrier if they had known the identity of the right party?
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3079.332,3081.85,--What is known is that they had the ticket.
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3082.817,3083.517,I understand all that.
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3083.517,3084.552,--to sue Costa Cruise Lines--
2009.09-337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.552,3092.04,"But we're talking about the -- about mindset of the defendant, and to say that they wouldn't have sued -- they would have sued the broker instead of this carrier?"
2009.09-337,1,39394,robert_s_glazier,,3093.04,3102.062,"--Well, the events played a role and demonstrated that even after the plaintiff was informed of the identity of the proper party, they continued to pursue the claim against the ticketing agent."
2009.09-337,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.062,3103.062,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-337,2,35542,mark_r_bendure,,3105.614,3107.966,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.962,3164.032,"This is sort of an equitable rule, isn't it, this mistake?"
2009.09-337,2,35542,mark_r_bendure,,3179.458,3194.402,--I think now one gets into a wonderful process of trying to identify mistakes on a scale of egregiousness.
2009.09-337,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3205.442,3209.311,I would have thought your answer would have been: This has nothing to do with equity at all.
2009.09-337,2,35542,mark_r_bendure,,3211.061,3211.577,Certainly.
2009.09-337,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3282.09,3287.042,"This might be tangential, but is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime Commission look into this?"
2009.09-337,2,35542,mark_r_bendure,,3295.296,3296.648,--It may well--
2009.09-337,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.648,3298.214,"Is that true, what I'm suggesting or not?"
2009.09-337,2,35542,mark_r_bendure,,3299.433,3300.133,--I don't know.
2009.09-337,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3309.038,3312.24,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-337,2,35542,mark_r_bendure,,3312.24,3312.24,Thank you.
2009.09-337,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3312.24,0.0,The case is submitted.
