1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.268,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-5118, Derrick Morgan v. Illinois."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,38.157,40.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,145.869,162.028,"Is that question... would that question, is it really asking, will you... would you always impose a death penalty, even if you are instructed to weigh mitigating and aggravating circumstances?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,162.028,167.772,That question did not... the form of the question did not discuss the Illinois statute.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,169.662,175.158,"So, in short, it does cover that... it does mean would you disobey your instructions."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,175.158,180.361,"--Actually, it definitely does mean would you disobey the instructions."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,190.636,196.4,"Well, let's assume they said, and satisfied the court, yeah, we'll obey our instructions."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,203.625,205.776,There's a tremendous amount of discretion.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.776,209.91,But the question wasn't just narrowed to that.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,209.91,215.183,The question was not narrowed as to whether they could weigh aggravation or mitigation.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,215.183,223.138,"Or it wasn't narrowed to whether where you have discretion, whether you would always vote for the death penalty?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,223.138,224.449,"No, it wasn't."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.189,248.906,"Well, I know, but if somebody, any juror who said, I won't obey my instructions, is going to be thrown off, isn't he?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,251.377,254.54,"No, he's not going to say that he would not obey the instructions."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.588,271.019,"Mr. Andrews, why do you say it amounts to violating your instructions?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,295.125,296.116,You're right.
1991.91-5118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.511,325.846,And it's your position that there's nothing in these instructions that the State can point to to counter the effect that you fear.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,325.846,332.792,"No, there is absolutely nothing in the instructions, because that is precisely what they are told, that they have that discretion, and it is pure weighing."
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.976,363.019,"Is a part of your submission, Mr. Andrews, kind of sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander, that since the State is entitled to ask Witherspoon/Witt types of questions to jurors to see if they would ever impose the death penalty, you should be able to ask similar questions kind of pointing in the other direction?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,363.019,364.691,--That is part of our argument.
1991.91-5118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.702,385.916,"Well, would your position be the same if the Witherspoon question was not asked?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,385.916,400.545,"I believe that even if the State does not Witherspoon, the defendant's interest in obtaining an impartial jury is so significant that he should, at his request, be entitled to have the judge inquire of these jurors whether they would automatically impose death."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.114,422.53,"Would you say you're entitled to have a question asked of jurors, do you favor the death penalty?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,427.523,439.562,"No, Your Honor, we merely want a question that would reveal whether they could, you know, consider the mitigation and follow what the Constitution requires, and not be automatic death penalty jurors."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.562,441.793,"Mr. Andrews, you mentioned fundamental fairness."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,446.644,447.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.525,459.974,"How can you rely... I thought we've held, I know we've held, that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to... that there is no Sixth Amendment right to a jury in the penalty phase of a trial."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,459.974,469.592,"Well, when there is a jury in the penalty phase in the trial, when the trier of fact in the penalty phase has to be impartial, and--"
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.592,472.504,"Well, that's a due process claim, though, not a Sixth Amendment claim."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,472.504,485.313,"--Even though there is no right to a jury, it seems to me that when the State gives you the right to a jury, that the jury has to be impartial, as required."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.313,487.723,"Well, again, that's, it seems to me, a due process assertion."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,494.035,498.87,"Well, this Court has specifically held in Turner v. Murray that the Sixth Amendment applies."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.749,514.461,I'm just saying I don't understand it.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,519.173,523.495,"No, Your Honor, it wouldn't hurt my feelings to rely on the equality argument, either."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.089,582.715,I take it that in the State courts of Illinois the judge voir dires the jury all the time?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,582.715,584.366,--The judge has absolute discretion.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.966,616.817,"Would it have satisfied you if the judge was willing to ask the jury, do you swear to follow your instructions, including the instruction to weigh any mitigating evidence against the aggravating evidence?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,616.817,617.896,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.896,618.998,Would that satisfy you?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,618.998,619.979,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.979,621.048,Why not?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,621.048,631.216,"Because as was pointed out earlier, these people might think that they're weighing mitigation and aggravation, but they're not weighing it in any meaningful manner as is contemplated by the Constitution."
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.494,647.566,"Well, how would your question bring it out any more subtly or more discreetly?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,647.566,650.51,It would just directly ask them.
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.817,666.388,"But you're going to find a fair amount of people, I dare say, who answer no to that question."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,666.388,667.089,Yes.
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.089,677.826,And yet are very likely to find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,677.826,681.429,"Well, we're not arguing that the death penalty can't be imposed in suitable cases."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.429,687.482,"Would it have satisfied you if the judge says, well, I'll ask this amended question."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,692.425,699.941,"That would, I believe, satisfy me, because that would reveal that these people would always impose a death penalty."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.482,720.686,But our law does not prevent them from always imposing the death penalty.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,746.382,750.873,What the case law has said is that weighing has to be meaningful.
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.038,758.19,Where does it say that it must be meaningful?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,775.75,779.503,"--Well, the defendant has a right to present mitigation."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.288,788.119,Why is that?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,801.497,803.92,"Yes, because you cannot follow the law to--"
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.92,807.912,"No, the law tells me to give it whatever weight I think it's entitled to."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,814.165,817.438,"--I'm not saying that these are bad people, or anything of that nature."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.183,843.014,Were you trial counsel?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,843.014,844.786,"No, I was not."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.786,846.887,Have you tried death cases?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,846.887,848.327,"No death murder cases, Your Honor."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.327,855.712,How often would you predict that some juror is going to answer yes to your question?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,855.712,857.943,I would have no way of predicting.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.108,872.213,You speak about these people as though they were really quite a group of people.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,872.213,874.854,--I honestly couldn't tell you how large a group of people there are.
1991.91-5118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,904.095,906.476,At least we knew there was one in Ross v. Oklahoma.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,906.476,908.087,"Yes, and there was one in Mu'Min."
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,971.549,984.967,"Well, what about a person who is perfectly willing to follow the instructions, but if they were questioned, they said, you know, I really am not much moved at all by this evidence of an abused childhood."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,996.595,1002.098,"--No, because he can consider the mitigation, he just does not give a certain type that much weight."
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1016.338,1019.39,Isn't that going to be the next step if we rule in your favor?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1019.39,1020.129,--No.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.016,1067.971,"Of course, if there are one of these persons who, if you didn't have your question asked and there was one of these always will give the death penalty people on the jury, of course, he couldn't control the verdict just by voting for the death penalty alone."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1067.971,1068.612,No.
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.395,1074.846,"And it's different on the other side, though."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1089.597,1092.959,"Yes, that's absolutely true, and that's the whole point of the statute."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.555,1132.624,Are you so interested because you would think that that single juror out of the 12 would be able to unduly influence the other 11?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1132.624,1135.344,"No, it is not a matter of undue influence at all."
1991.91-5118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.063,1153.767,"And if this one person wasn't so hide bound, he might be the person to vote against it."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1153.767,1154.669,Exactly.
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.164,1169.088,And you say the Constitution requires that you have 12 shots at this rather than just 11 or 10 or whatever?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1169.088,1171.59,I'm not saying that the Constitution requires any number of jurors or anything.
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.352,1199.776,"Well, I think if you're talking about a Sixth Amendment right to a jury and an impartial jury, I think that argument may go."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1213.697,1220.96,"Well, if that is the position of this Court, the next cases you're going to see is what about with three of these people on the jury?"
1991.91-5118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.954,1229.806,Do I understand you're making the rather extreme argument that you're entitled to have all 12 jurors unbiased?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1229.806,1230.808,"Yes, exactly."
1991.91-5118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.216,1264.849,"For making the rather extreme argument that you are a biased juror if your particular view, which is not unlawful, of a crime is that this crime deserves the death penalty, and I will listen to the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, Your Honor, but I will tell you now, with this kind of a crime, I will always find in favor of the death penalty."
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1266.411,1268.382,"Yes, they cannot consider mitigation."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.274,1272.205,They consider it.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1274.987,1277.477,"Well, they don't meaningfully consider it."
1991.91-5118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.547,1335.736,I don't understand.
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1337.619,1343.071,"You go and interview the actual jurors and you ask them, were you... did you believe that you would automatically--"
1991.91-5118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.071,1346.434,But will the judge allow you to inquire into that?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1346.434,1348.735,--This is after the trial.
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.907,1370.928,And the statement of the interviewer is admissible in the collateral proceedings?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1370.928,1376.013,--You could call the juror themselves after they've talked to you.
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.944,1428.447,"Mr. Andrews, how do you want this question to be asked?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1445.388,1446.029,No.
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.609,1466.521,Should be imposed for what?
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1471.974,1473.316,"No, the death penalty."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.23,1483.722,"What if the juror says, well, it would depend on the nature of the murder?"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1487.606,1491.797,I think that that is a juror who can consider mitigation and who is not an automatic death penalty juror.
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.761,1501.173,"And you don't think counsel would follow up with, well, let me describe to you this murder, and then the circumstances of the murder--"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1501.173,1510.49,"No, not in Illinois, because the trial judge has complete discretion, and if he thinks that the trial counsel is doing something that he shouldn't be doing, then he would tell counsel to stop."
1991.91-5118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.49,1515.044,"--So you would just describe the nature of the offense, murder, or whatever--"
1991.91-5118,0,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,1515.044,1516.334,Yes.
1991.91-5118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.679,1541.929,"--Thank you, Mr. Andrews."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1543.671,1547.645,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.852,1597.487,"May I ask, on that juror, I gather he's the one that said he would automatically impose the death penalty if there were a conviction of first degree murder?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1597.487,1614.347,"Well, he related, too, that a friend's parents had been murdered, and he speaks somewhat inaccurately, but I would say a fair reading of that is that he would either put that person to death or perhaps he was referring to the petitioner in this case."
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.347,1628.599,"The question I wanted to ask you is supposing the juror, it comes out during the colloquy, that he believed in the eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and that if there were ever a conviction for first degree murder, he thought that nothing less than the death penalty should be imposed."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1632.262,1632.741,"Yes, I do."
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.94,1661.882,May I carry my question one step further?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1670.437,1673.49,"No, I don't believe it's a constitutional issue."
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1673.49,1676.442,How then do you explain Ross?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1676.442,1685.258,"In Ross v. Oklahoma, that juror did not sit, but a peremptory challenge was used."
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1685.258,1694.931,"Well, but I thought the Court made it very clear that if that juror had been seated, that a reversal would have been required under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1694.931,1709.941,"Well, I think that in Ross the question was the whole make-up of the jury, whether the jury was impartial, a kind of a factual inquiry about the impartiality of that juror."
1991.91-5118,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.543,1729.486,"Mr. Gillis, why did you answer yes to Justice Stevens' question?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1732.238,1750.28,"It may not be a constitutional violation, but I think a judge using his discretion could apply the Witt standard and say that this person was impaired on that issue, that he may not be able to set aside that view, and he may not be able to follow the law."
1991.91-5118,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1752.74,1763.588,"Well, it's discretionary, then, for him to say, not necessary but discretionary for him to say, something like this."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1795.089,1804.205,I think it is within his discretion to rule whether this person is so impaired that the person could not consider the issues in the case.
1991.91-5118,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.205,1828.089,"Well, are you saying, then, it would also be within his discretion to say, I find that the person in fact could not go in one direction regardless of what the evidence would be, but in my judgment, as long as this juror will consider the evidence before he comes to the inevitable result, that is enough, and I will not excuse for cause."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1830.881,1833.692,"I think a leaning is not necessarily enough, but--"
1991.91-5118,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1833.692,1834.864,"Well, this isn't a leaning."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1861.582,1870.477,"--I think if the juror, before hearing the evidence, is locked into one point of view and cannot give up that point of view, that that is not a proper juror."
1991.91-5118,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1870.477,1878.892,"So that if the outcome is certain, if no process of deliberation would change the result, then the judge has to excuse for cause."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1878.892,1881.644,If the judge makes that finding.
1991.91-5118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.675,1886.827,And does the Federal Constitution require that result?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1886.827,1891.652,I don't believe that that is in the Sixth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment.
1991.91-5118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.434,1909.473,"Well, if the Constitution doesn't require it, then I don't understand your answer in this Court when you have a Federal court trying to determine what the State court must do."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1911.534,1912.766,--I'm sorry.
1991.91-5118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.964,1941.744,What if the State wants to ask prospective jurors whether they would never be able to impose a death penalty?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1941.744,1954.283,"I... the form, I think they could legitimately ask questions about attitudes about the death penalty as Witt and Witherspoon have talked about."
1991.91-5118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.283,1966.839,"Can the State require the trial judge in Illinois to ask those questions, or such a question of prospective jurors?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1966.839,1969.972,"Other than through persuasion, I don't think the State can require it."
1991.91-5118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1969.972,1973.695,There is no constitutional requirement that the State be allowed to do that?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1973.695,1974.206,That's right.
1991.91-5118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.787,1981.118,And you find nothing in the opinions of this Court to suggest the contrary?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1981.118,1982.53,--That's right.
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.809,2006.567,Suppose we say that it is a violation of the Federal Constitution for a juror who automatically will vote for the death penalty to sit on the jury.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2010.919,2013.55,"No, I don't think so."
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2017.223,2027.24,"Because even though there is a constitutional right to excuse that juror, you don't have to provide a mechanism for discovering that bias?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2027.24,2033.535,"--In Ross, the juror admittedly and clearly said, I am always for the death penalty."
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2037.406,2044.411,What we're asking here is whether or not there must be a mechanism to uncover and disclose that bias.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2044.411,2046.732,--We have a mechanism here.
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.855,2076.833,You rely on both the voir dire and the instructions as being adequate to guard against any juror who would automatically impose the death penalty.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2076.833,2100.249,"The whole trappings of a trial court, the solemnity of it, the judge is there, the voir dire, the introductory remarks, and the juror's oath that he swears to follow the law and apply the law to the facts, and then the instructions, which, in this case, narrowed the discretion, that still there is discretion, but it's vastly narrowed from the situation."
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.249,2110.285,"Well, can you point to anything specific in the instructions that it would advise a juror that it is his duty not to impose the death penalty automatically?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2110.285,2117.771,The instruction says if you find any mitigating factor that you should not impose the death penalty.
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.043,2124.496,You just--
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2124.496,2125.064,No.
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.064,2126.185,--What?
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2126.185,2127.587,That's correct.
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2127.587,2128.646,"What was your page, Mr. Gillis?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2128.646,2129.767,123.
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.263,2157.668,"Well, I suppose that the hypothetical is that this juror says, I don't think there are ever mitigating factors."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2157.668,2164.651,"Well, that's... that may be a matter that comes in the jury deliberation room once that occurs."
1991.91-5118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2164.651,2173.927,But my point is there's nothing in the instructions that would advise the juror that this was an incorrect disposition on his part.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2173.927,2182.372,"Everything about the process, including the instructions, directs the jurors to see if they can find mitigation."
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.249,2227.362,"Mr. Gillis, can I give you just one other hypothetical?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2253.388,2264.676,"Well, it seems to me that there's a basic core of fundamental rights in the Fourteenth Amendment that that situation would cry out for relief."
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.676,2267.337,"I think it would, too, but why wouldn't one do it, then?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2272.54,2281.058,"In the real world, we wouldn't be able to... there's nobody that stamps this person automatically for death penalty."
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.058,2283.62,"No, but that person very candidly says... and there are such people out there."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2317.38,2327.848,"My answer is that it's... and I hope I'm not quibbling... that it's not clear, with one person, whether this person is that type of person that would automatically--"
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.848,2337.955,"But I'm assuming in my hypothetical that the question is sufficiently unambiguous that you find that it is that kind of person, that the person just is the opposite of the Witherspoon-kind of person."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2351.644,2354.546,--The question in a State court of whether that violates fundamental fairness?
1991.91-5118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.546,2355.454,Yes.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2355.454,2356.325,I do.
1991.91-5118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.584,2368.685,Suppose enough of the facts are described.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2392.52,2400.975,"--Well, no, I think in that case we've assumed some knowledge about the facts, which raises another issue."
1991.91-5118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.975,2403.526,"Well, not all the mitigation."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2430.404,2438.021,"I think that the inquiry is about whether they could keep an open mind, follow the instructions that the judge gives them."
1991.91-5118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.021,2440.81,I can't keep an open mind if this person has killed several million people.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2443.464,2449.048,I think that juror is assuming knowledge about the facts in the case.
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.048,2457.753,"Certainly... by the way, Illinois bifurcates the penalty hearing."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2457.753,2458.223,Yes.
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.223,2463.076,"First into finding the statutory aggravating circumstance, and his age?"
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2463.076,2465.106,"First, it's to find if he's eligible--"
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.106,2465.687,Yes.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2469.04,2470.83,--there's any mitigating factors.
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.83,2475.303,"--Well, that phase, though, is for deciding whether he will get the death penalty."
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2475.303,2476.243,That's correct.
1991.91-5118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.243,2483.328,And there the judge specifically instructs him that they have a duty of following every instruction.
1991.91-5118,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2483.328,2484.23,Yes.
1991.91-5118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.3,2517.81,"Thank you, Mr. Gillis."
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2520.234,2522.014,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.91-5118,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2547.46,2550.484,"Was that dicta, do you suppose, in that case?"
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2550.484,2553.985,"It conceivably could have been, but it is very persuasive, it makes sense."
1991.91-5118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.186,2578.33,The State's complaint in Witherspoon was not that the juror would never impose the death penalty at the penalty stage.
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2593.251,2595.041,"--Not according to the State, no."
1991.91-5118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.041,2597.472,"Well, tell me, is the State wrong about that?"
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2598.464,2599.816,"No, this Court has said that--"
1991.91-5118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.816,2603.529,--Am I going to convict somebody just so I can impose the death penalty on somebody?
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2603.529,2604.778,"--I would not think so, no."
1991.91-5118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.778,2605.779,I wouldn't think so.
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2605.779,2606.14,No.
1991.91-5118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.14,2607.101,So Witherspoon is really a different situation.
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2612.207,2615.789,That is only part of the Witherspoon decision.
1991.91-5118,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.324,2663.389,Do you say that for every possible challenge for cause there must be voir dire directed to that possibility?
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2663.389,2663.799,--No.
1991.91-5118,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2675.446,2678.038,How about bias or partiality?
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2678.038,2682.464,"Even with bias and partiality, that's almost always covered in any event."
1991.91-5118,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.464,2684.302,"Well, but supposing a trial judge didn't cover it?"
1991.91-5118,2,15380,allen_h_andrews_iii,,2690.669,2692.377,It could be constitutional error.
1991.91-5118,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2711.338,2712.449,"Thank you, Mr. Andrews."
