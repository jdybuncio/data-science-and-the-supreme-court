1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,27.317,"You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Fawer."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,27.317,30.685,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.801,213.038,"Well, that distinction has been recognized since the time of Hale v. Henkel, hasn't it, in 1906."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,217.34,237.487,"It is true, Your Honor, I think it is fair to say, as this Court has said on... at least, I believe this Court has said, that they were addressing the question of whether or not the contents of corporate records, as opposed to the testimonial aspects of the Fifth Amendment, were in fact to be privileged?"
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.84,307.499,"And your claim here is that, by the act of producing the records, the fact that he was the one who produced them and not someone else would have had a tendency to incriminate him?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,307.499,308.566,That is correct.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.566,321.157,I would suppose your position would apply to any corporation... or to any person who is the custodian of the corporate records of anybody?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,321.157,321.707,That is correct.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.707,322.509,Of any corporation?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,322.509,325.278,That is exactly our position.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.811,329.43,So it's the one-man corporation has nothing to do with this case?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,329.43,330.699,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.423,352.112,"Well, let me... your client was forced to produce these records?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,352.112,352.495,--Yes.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.495,366.872,"And if he hadn't... and if he hadn't produced them, but a third person had, the fact that they were corporate records and had been authenticated, could be used against him?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,366.872,367.805,"Yes, in fact--"
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.805,370.907,If he hadn't produced them; if somebody else had?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,370.907,375.061,"--Yes, if he was not involved in any way in making those records available."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.679,386.433,"Well, I know, but all the... authentication does is to authenticate the fact that they are corporate records?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,386.433,390.403,"--Other people could authenticate... well, theoretically, could authenticate corporate records."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.403,394.688,"Well, he isn't any worse off if he has to authenticate them."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,397.974,398.942,"It seems to me, Your Honor--"
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.942,400.109,These are corporate records?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,400.109,400.892,--Yes.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.925,431.98,"Well, you're going to be using the fact that these are corporate records against him?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,431.98,435.599,We're going to be using the fact that he produced a particular record.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.354,487.817,"You're asking us to overrule a case that's some 80 years old, and I'm interested in just what sort of incriminating... to get into how a corporate custodian of a one-man corporation would incriminate himself by producing, or simply authenticating corporate records?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,487.817,489.9,"Two points on that, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.404,499.625,Hale v. Henkel; Wilson in 1911; White in 1943--
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,499.625,506.529,--But it is important to note when you look at Hale that technically what was done in Hale--
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.529,520.288,"--I'm not so much interested in the hypothesis; that is, the introduction of my question itself; and that is, how in this case, does a corporate custodian incriminate himself by simply authenticating corporate records?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,520.288,532.846,"--When Randy... if Randy Braswell... the direct response to your question is, if Randy Braswell didn't bring in records, when he turns those records over he is representing these are the records that you've asked for."
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.218,549.606,So he might incriminate himself because he's lying about whether those are all the corporate records--
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,549.606,551.141,That's one possibility.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.141,559.829,--That would be a defense to anyone responding to a subpoena: I may incriminate myself because I may not be producing everything the subpoena calls for.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,559.829,560.296,That's true.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.296,561.913,That would be an astounding doctrine.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,561.913,562.448,"Well, I don't know."
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,596.252,600.388,How would the Tax Court get these records?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,600.388,601.273,How would the... excuse me.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.823,606.192,How could they get it other than the way in this case?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,606.192,606.727,Very simply.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,617.416,619.249,Why should he be immunized?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,619.249,620.968,"Why you're immunized, remember--"
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.968,622.001,Why?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,622.001,628.188,Because the Fifth Amendment protects him from not incriminating himself testimonially.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.188,631.24,Would that apply to any secretary of any corporation?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,631.24,632.842,If that is to whom the subpoena--
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,632.842,636.544,"Well, how would you get them otherwise if you didn't want to immunize?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,636.544,637.96,--You still get the records.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.96,639.06,How?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,639.06,640.993,You can get somebody else.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,640.993,641.66,Who?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,641.66,645.778,Somebody else in the corporation who would not--
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,645.778,646.528,Who?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,646.528,650.849,"In this corporation, I don't know that there is anybody else."
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.849,652.132,That's what I thought.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,653.551,655.668,But the same is true in Doe.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,659.872,661.888,"Well, what would be about General Motors?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,661.888,663.406,General Motors--
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,663.406,664.873,The same rule would apply?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,664.873,666.291,If you use the direct--
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.291,668.341,Would you want the same rule apply?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,668.341,669.06,--Yes.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,669.06,670.243,To General Motors?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,670.243,671.21,If you think--
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.21,672.845,So you couldn't get the records intact?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,674.695,680.099,--So we understand... you have a right to those records; the Government has a right to the contents of those records.
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.099,681.118,But you can't get them.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,681.118,698.56,"You can get them in two ways: you can get them either by immunizing... that narrow immunization as to the testimonial implications of the production on the person you served your subpoena on; if that's who you insist produces them, or you find somebody else who does not have such a claim."
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,708.851,711.22,"Why, that isn't even interesting."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,711.22,712.203,Excuse me?
1987.87-3,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.203,714.755,You don't even interest me at all.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,714.755,728.349,"The point, I think, Your Honor, that we're talking about, in Fifth Amendment protection, it is not limited to solely someone who has a sole proprietorship."
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.945,801.495,"You are, in a sense."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,807.265,807.965,That is correct.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.965,815.204,The Court has in the privilege against self-incrimination has always drawn a line between an individual and a corporation.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,815.204,831.314,"It has always drawn that line, but I believe, I think it was Justice Brennan has indicated in a number of cases, the line was always drawn with respect to access to contents, not testimony."
1987.87-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,884.199,896.774,"Well, Mr. Fawer, Fisher specifically made reference to the collective entity rule, and I thought in a way which indicated an attempt to preserve it."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,937.599,942.82,I have a problem because I think that what the Government is asking you to do is to engage in a pure fiction.
1987.87-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,944.422,948.557,"Well, the use of the corporations is a legal fiction--"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,948.557,948.957,--Truly.
1987.87-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.957,951.159,--and this is a result of that.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,951.159,961.099,But I do not know why this Court should want to be party to using a patent fiction to deny a natural person his rights under the Fifth Amendment.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.234,970.823,The problem really is that the contents of these records may be very incriminating.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,970.823,973.359,"We suggest to Your Honor, they may be."
1987.87-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.595,991.986,I take it that part of the immunity you would want is that it is unlawful for the Government to use the act of production to show that he knew the documents existed?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,991.986,993.353,"That is part of it, Your Honor, yes."
1987.87-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.353,1006.58,"So in the case of any corporation, the officer who produces the documents, under your rule, cannot be charged with knowledge of their existence in any prosecution?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1006.58,1016.185,"He cannot be charged with knowledge of the existence of the document, but what the document contains can be used against him."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.185,1018.237,"Well, not until they're authenticated."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1018.237,1020.07,Authenticated by him or someone else?
1987.87-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.07,1024.473,"But knowledge of the documents is highly relevant in most criminal prosecutions, we know that."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1024.473,1025.757,"Yes, it is."
1987.87-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1025.757,1048.24,"And that would apply to General Motors, because some officers may have confidential knowledge of a very secret transaction, and the only people that know about the transaction are the ones that are producing the documents, and your rule would require immunity from the use of the production of the documents to show they knew they existed."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1048.24,1048.923,My rule--
1987.87-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1048.923,1049.907,"That's your rule, isn't it?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1049.907,1054.644,--If he is the only person... if you need to have him produce it.
1987.87-3,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.644,1055.111,"Now, wait."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1062.682,1063.132,Exactly.
1987.87-3,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.132,1066.551,You would still be able to show that he knew of it in other fashions.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1066.551,1067.234,Exactly.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.138,1103.909,But until they're properly authenticated by somebody the records are not admissible against him at all.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1103.909,1105.943,"That is true, but they're are very--"
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.943,1109.563,"Contents or otherwise, they have to be authenticated."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1109.563,1110.613,--Someone has to authenticate them.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.621,1122.221,"Yes, but--"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1122.221,1123.338,But in Tax Court--
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.338,1129.977,--maybe only the representatives of corporations know which ones they are and can pick out the one who needs the immunity best.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1132.763,1134.079,--I do not think--
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.079,1141.618,"And in this case, you talk about alternates, why couldn't your client have designated somebody else to produce the documents on behalf of the corporation and gotten the same protection?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1141.618,1143.851,--We would have no problem should all--
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.851,1145.486,Shouldn't the Government have accepted that?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1145.486,1150.355,"--The Government, I think, would have accepted that; but they might not have accepted at this point."
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.036,1172.738,"Well, but say he hired his lawyer and his lawyer produced the documents, says,"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1179.141,1197.019,"Justice Stevens, if I were Mr. Braswell's private attorney at that point, and some other lawyer, I would tell Mr. Braswell he should still assert his privilege and not rely on the possibility that that other lawyer would assert an attorney-client privilege of some sort to protect Mr. Braswell."
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.019,1200.388,You mean you assume the attorney would not act in his proper--
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1200.388,1205.359,"I don't assume that, but I don't want to assume the contrary either."
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.167,1216.6,--Well--
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1216.6,1217.583,--then I have lost.
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.583,1218.368,--I don't buy that.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1223.686,1230.259,But I do not... I normally... and do at this point make the same assumption that Your Honor does.
1987.87-3,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.607,1289.465,"Does your grant of immunity say that the Government will not be able to use this Defendant's production of the fact of the production for any purpose, is that it?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1289.465,1298.754,"The fact of the act of production, and that any fact or any inference growing from the act of production cannot be used against him in the court."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.754,1306.926,"So to the extent that the act of production amounts to authentication, it may not be used against him."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1309.626,1309.961,Absolutely.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.478,1319.317,"Well, why does the Government's concession that it cannot use it, in sum, why does that fall short in your view?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1319.317,1327.673,"Your Honor, if you look at it, if you read pages... I ask the Court to carefully read pages 34 and 35 of the Government's brief."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.321,1384.259,"In a corporation, would you be making the same argument if the subpoena had run against the corporation?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1384.259,1384.959,I would make the--
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.959,1393.782,"And the corporation sent up a representative and the representative said,"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1397.734,1400.019,"--What, the representative said that?"
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.821,1405.59,"Well, he's a custodian."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1405.59,1410.494,--I have no problem with that custodian making that assertion and claiming the Fifth Amendment.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.494,1415.196,"Well, you subpoenaed the corporation and the corporation says,"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1418.481,1421.616,I don't think the corporation can simply say that.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.353,1425.903,Oh?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1428.788,1430.721,"Well, that's for them to say."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.507,1441.279,"Well, if they send up somebody... what if, in response to this subpoena a man arrives... a hooded man arrives with a mask on?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1453.821,1455.373,And the Government takes them?
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.373,1456.273,Sure.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1456.273,1457.558,"I have no problem, because I cannot see--"
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.558,1459.275,Are they authenticated?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1459.275,1459.558,--No.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.894,1466.663,The corporation has sent up the records.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1470.482,1477.519,"Two things: one, in a prosecution of the corporation, it would make no difference whether... it would not affect Randy Braswell."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.254,1503.37,How can they use it?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1513.644,1516.513,But this Court has always said that that is testimony.
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.513,1517.879,"All right, but that's all he's done."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1528.487,1530.304,"No, they're going to have the records."
1987.87-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.641,1540.593,I thought you said that the act of production may authenticate the records?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1540.593,1550.567,"But I... I assumed, I thought we were operating on the assumption that we would not... we were giving him... we would assert the privilege and that you would have an immunity as to that."
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.852,1560.422,"Well, the one-man corporation, how are you going to get anybody to produce records if this doctrine is applied?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1560.422,1571.564,"--Your Honor, my position is, this case on its facts, in terms of its practical difficulties, is no different than Doe, none whatsoever."
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.564,1573.997,"Well then, maybe Doe was wrong?"
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1573.997,1576.366,I think Doe was right in that sense.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.884,1595.512,"If you can't explain... I'm only one of nine, but if you can't explain how a corporation... how a one-man corporation's documents can be subpoenaed and authenticated under this doctrine, you know, and I daresay, you'll lose more than one person."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1595.512,1599.714,"--Well, let me explain it to you and still keep some rebuttal time at the same time, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.282,1629.233,Maybe the accountant doesn't have authority to produce them if he's--
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1629.233,1631.018,He only has to authenticate.
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.018,1631.568,"--No, no, no."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1635.917,1638.286,"No, I'm saying you subpoena it from Randy Braswell."
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.286,1639.052,With immunity?
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1639.052,1639.571,With immunity.
1987.87-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.571,1640.188,"Oh, oh, oh."
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1640.188,1641.654,With immunity... you gave him the immunity.
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.654,1642.773,You don't know that he didn't even look at the records.
1987.87-3,0,35812,michael_s_fawer,,1642.773,1647.892,"Look, he has the immunity, and he's still prosecuted a week later; a month later."
1987.87-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.413,1680.363,"Thank you, Mr. Fawer."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1693.123,1695.907,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1735.866,1747.173,Is that true even if production of the documents would incriminate the person in a trial against that person without reference to the corporation?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1747.173,1747.673,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.292,1765.302,So that you are willing to try the case on the assumption that Braswell might well incriminate himself by reference to the knowledge or the existence of the documents?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1765.302,1768.437,We're willing to submit the case to this Court on that assumption.
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.437,1777.877,And you can use the fact that he produced these documents against him to prove those matters?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1777.877,1779.744,Yes and no.
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.446,1783.996,And I can't understand it.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1783.996,1797.94,"All right: I think Justice White's rather colorful hypothetical is helpful in understanding the difference between what we say cannot be used, and what we say can be used."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1837.7,1840.05,What is it that prevents you from using that?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1842.485,1844.921,"--It's not an immunity question, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1846.539,1848.006,You're saying you can't use it.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1854.627,1862.482,"--We think it flows logically from the rationale of the White case decided in 1944, a rationale that's been reiterated many times."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1862.482,1875.642,"You mean you're telling us that if Mr. Braswell's attorney in a subsequent prosecution objects to this evidence, that it will be... the objection must be sustained?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1875.642,1882.712,"If he objects to the evidence that it was Randy Braswell who personally produced the records, yes."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.712,1885.831,So that he does have the Fifth Amendment privilege?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1885.831,1887.7,"I don't think it's a Fifth Amendment privilege, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.7,1890.2,"What kind of privilege is it, then?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1890.2,1896.722,I think it's simply a question of holding the Government to the underlying theory on which it gets these documents.
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.722,1901.857,What case do you cite for that proposition?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1901.857,1906.677,"For the underlying theory, I cite primarily the White case decided in 1944."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.347,1948.671,"Well, I just want to make it clear: you are conceding that he does have a privilege against his own incrimination; and you are conceding that these documents may not be used against him for that purpose?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1948.671,1953.242,"Your Honor, I wouldn't phrase it that way, no."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1953.242,1956.527,"Well, what protection does he have?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1956.527,1962.331,"If the Government at trial asked the question,"
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.898,1994.735,But that... I don't really see your point.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2003.091,2012.781,"--Well, I think the best I can do is to ask the Court to look at the quotation on pages 21 and 22 of our brief from the White case."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.229,2040.731,But this is the constructive immunity doctrine that we declined to adopt in Doe.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2040.731,2043.3,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.565,2067.014,But you haven't followed the statutory procedures for immunity.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2075.504,2079.324,"Your Honor, I must respectfully disagree."
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.036,2107.475,What case from this Court... you've just cited us to this language from White and now I've read it over again.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2129.758,2130.858,"No case, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.858,2132.793,"Well then, why do you concede it?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2132.793,2134.376,We think it flows logically.
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.178,2140.964,But it seems to me it flows logically because Braswell has a privilege.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2159.293,2168.149,"Again, our position, Your Honor, is that we can use against Braswell the fact that Worldwide Purchasing and Worldwide Machinery--"
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2168.149,2168.483,No.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2186.594,2192.598,"--The fact that he personally produced the documents, the answer, I believe, is ""no""."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2192.914,2194.45,But on what theory?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2194.45,2195.6,--On the theory that--
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2195.6,2200.085,That he has a Fifth Amendment privilege: that must be your only theory.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2200.085,2202.787,"--Well, Your Honor, again, I would respectfully disagree."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.376,2212.328,How do you verify it?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2224.469,2227.087,The process server can verify that.
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.087,2229.771,I don't know how you get Braswell on the stand.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2233.325,2234.158,Sure.
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.158,2236.277,Is he a defendant in this action?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2236.277,2238.895,"Well, of course, this is a grand jury matter, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.895,2245.549,"I mean, you're assuming he's going to be indicted, but I don't think you can put him on the witness stand if he doesn't voluntarily go on the witness stand, he waives his Fifth Amendment privileges."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2245.549,2246.566,That's correct.
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.989,2259.476,"Yes, but what if he decides, ""I'm not going to testify"", he says, ""Under the Fifth Amendment""."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2262.345,2266.462,"The process-server, certainly."
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.462,2274.466,"Well, there was a response to the subpoena... there was a response to the subpoena that the corporation sent its records up in the response to the subpoena."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2282.569,2288.307,"To the extent that's a fair inference from the fact that the corporation produced the records, yes."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.307,2293.611,"Suppose he's on trial, and the question is whether he knew of the documents?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2296.763,2301.216,"Yes, as long as what the process-server says is only that the corporation produced them."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.543,2351.065,"Well, if what you've said is true, I don't see that there is very much ground between you and the Petitioner here."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2363.373,2368.611,"Justice Scalia, I think there's a world of difference between our position and the Petitioner's position."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.309,2400.915,"He wouldn't allow you to say even that the corporation had produced it, if by the corporation, you mean Braswell."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2409.688,2411.371,That's how I understand his position.
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.338,2441.64,"If these were private records, you wouldn't be able to get them by a subpoena, right?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2444.659,2462.303,"If he was a sole-proprietorship, for example; and he made an adequate showing of self-incrimination, then we would have to grant statutory use immunity to get them; that is the Doe case."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.303,2463.572,"It seems very strange, doesn't it?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2466.024,2475.813,"Well, Your Honor, we made the argument in Doe that that was strange; that we should be able to get those records as easily as corporate documents, and the Court rejected it."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.182,2485.752,"Well, the question is whether or not there is a testimonial incident to the production, isn't it?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2491.306,2505.482,"Well, Your Honor, we're submitting this case on the assumption... not the concession... but the assumption, that there could be a testimonial incident to this act of production, as the Court held there was in Doe."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2522.027,2532.05,"But if that's true, then your answer to Justice Scalia's question would be there is no testimonial compulsion when a private person is forced to produce the documents?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2532.05,2538.137,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think the doctrine turns on the lack of testimonial compulsion."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.45,2563.438,So the Fifth Amendment is essentially... your argument reads
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2579.448,2580.481,"I wouldn't put it that way, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.316,2584.601,"But that's essentially what your doctrine comes down to, right?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2590.588,2597.925,"--One could put it that way, but as Justice O'Connor pointed out, corporations are fictional entities."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.563,2605.181,"Well, Braswell is not a corporate entity and he doesn't want to testify against himself."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2605.181,2616.406,"--No, but he wants Worldwide Purchasing Corporation and Worldwide Machinery Corporation to not testify against him by their act of producing documents."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.406,2619.441,He's perfectly content to let them do it if they can do it through some other agent.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2648.008,2673.759,"We're unwilling to do that, Your Honor, because in some cases at least, there are components to the act of production that are very important to us that we want to use against the individual, not necessarily that Randy Braswell produced the documents; but that the corporation had possession and control of these documents; that they are the corporate records."
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.759,2679.563,"Of course in most cases, I suppose, you could always just subpoena the corporation?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2679.563,2681.931,"Well Your Honor, that's very problematic."
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.304,2698.858,"All right, suppose you subpoena a small corporation and you just get no response?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2698.858,2700.21,That's the problem.
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.21,2702.06,And then what are you going to do?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2702.06,2702.893,That's the problem.
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.706,2726.008,But that's perfectly all right when it's his diary you're trying to get.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2750.893,2752.909,"No, I can't agree completely with that."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.72,2793.57,"Well, on that basis, it wouldn't do any good to subpoena him."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2803.527,2809.764,"At least we have the threat of contempt against him, Your Honor, in that case."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2809.764,2822.322,"Would you want us to go so far as to say that, by becoming an officer in a corporation, you simply waive your Fifth Amendment rights as to anything you might ever be asked to produce?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2822.322,2824.274,As to any corporate records you may ever be asked to produce?
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2824.274,2824.907,Yes.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2824.907,2828.476,I think the Court has gone that far many times.
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2828.476,2844.335,"So you think the law is that Braswell has no Fifth Amendment rights because he formed a corporation, as to any documents he might be asked to produce as a corporate officer, even though there may be some testimonial incidents to that production?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2844.335,2857.912,"Yes, and if Your Honor will indulge me, I'd just like to read a couple of things this Court said in the Curcio case, a case primarily relied on by my opponents, to see just whether the Court has said that."
1987.87-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2892.085,2901.774,"Well, if that's true, then to go back to the beginning, I don't understand why you make the concession that you do on page 34 that for some purposes you cant' use the information?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2901.774,2906.945,"Well, Your Honor, again, if the concession is unwise, I'm sure the Court will tell us so."
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.159,2956.692,May I interrupt at this point?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2966.466,2967.533,--Yes.
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.533,2974.822,"Would it have been in compliance with the subpoena for the secretary of the corporation to have brought the documents to court and got on the witness stand and said,"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2983.159,2987.213,I don't think that would have constituted technical compliance.
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.213,2987.88,Why not?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3002.057,3007.626,"Because the problems of who, within corporations can actually lay his hands on documents?"
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.626,3010.162,"Well, he's prepared to testify that he had the authority."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3016.232,3021.384,"Justice Stevens, if that actually happened, I think the Government would shout ""Hurrah""."
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.384,3029.707,"Well, it happens all the time, I mean, I think often, very often, corporations respond to subpoenas by bringing in some officer other than the particular one that was designated in the subpoena."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3029.707,3031.576,Sure and we regularly accept that.
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.692,3036.813,And I'm really asking whether you have a duty to accept that?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3036.813,3046.851,"I think not, Your Honor, because there is a problem with subpoenaing documents from one individual--"
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.851,3049.887,But he's not an individual under your submission.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3049.887,3068.332,"--from one corporate officer who may know of documents that are squirreled away somewhere; and as a ploy, has somebody else respond, and truthfully respond that he's made a diligent search of every place in the corporation where he knows that--"
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.332,3078.14,"In other words, what you're saying is you want to be able to ask the individual whether he has in fact disclosed everything he knows about the corporate documents?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3081.675,3085.211,"--Well, Your Honor, there we do run into the Curcio case."
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.697,3092.747,On behalf of the corporation?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3092.747,3095.768,"On behalf of the corporation, We have that right under prior cases."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.768,3100.07,"Why don't you call him to the stand on behalf of the corporation: you know, just have the bailiff say,"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3110.628,3112.428,"Well, Your Honor, we tried that in 1957."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.428,3113.211,"It didn't work, did it?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3113.211,3114.73,Didn't work.
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3116.213,3129.672,"Why is that a rational line, I mean... if you think that people have this bifurcated personality: there is Braswell the person and Braswell the corporation?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3129.672,3141.047,"Well, Your Honor, as I read the Curcio case, in which we were trying to make the argument that that was not a rational line and the Court disagreed with us, there are pragmatic concerns at work in this area."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3188.111,3193.182,The Fifth Amendment doesn't strike me as a very effective provision.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3207.941,3217.547,"Well, of course, Your Honor, constitutional doctrines often impede Government effectiveness; limitations on constitutional doctrines regularly aid Government effectiveness."
1987.87-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3231.973,3238.211,"Mr. Englert, what is the significance at the end of the subpoena where it stated that,"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3247.25,3249.601,"Well, that's of course, very significant, Justice Marshall."
1987.87-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3253.47,3255.736,"Well, that's why you haven't mentioned it?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3257.922,3268.48,"--Well, I'm sorry about that, but the point is, that we're not seeking to get testimony before the grand jury the way the Government tried to get testimony before the grand jury in Curcio."
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.419,3358.037,Let me ask you one more question before you sit down?
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3373.48,3374.832,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.899,3415.826,"Well, if the question becomes incrimination in this case, the Government won't fare well, I suspect, because, you know, you don't have evidence as to whether or not it will incriminate."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3423.08,3430.834,"Well, Your Honor, the Fisher case indicated a fairly narrow scope, I think, for this act of production doctrine."
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3449.545,3452.682,"Let me ask one other question, if I may?"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3474.013,3476.88,I think that both can be incriminating.
1987.87-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3476.88,3490.705,"You concede just the mere physical act of delivering the documents can be incriminating, even if he took them in the office; says, as a note that, as Justice Marshall called your attention to, say you just delivered the documents; just dumped them off in the process-server's office; and left them."
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3496.692,3497.911,"On those facts alone, no."
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.93,3502.882,I thought it was only the act of production that we're talking about in this case.
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3505.348,3507.25,That's correct.
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3507.25,3507.65,You never--
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3515.69,3516.39,Yes.
1987.87-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.39,3518.991,And we're talking also about the fact--
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3528.147,3533.901,"Yes, to Justice Kennedy, although with the same kinds of limitations I've given in previous answers."
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3533.901,3541.59,"--What if he brings a whole batch of documents; a whole batch of sets of corporate records and he just plunks them down and he says,"
1987.87-3,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,3546.392,3551.129,That's a typical response and we get that we delighted.
1987.87-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3551.129,3558.2,"It's not much use for authentication, is it?"
1987.87-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3558.2,3559.384,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
1987.87-3,2,35812,michael_s_fawer,,3563.503,3566.538,"Very briefly, Your Honor, thank you."
1987.87-3,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3634.6,3636.302,Did you disagree with that?
1987.87-3,2,35812,michael_s_fawer,,3636.302,3639.754,"--Yes, I disagree... I think they should not be permitted to do that."
1987.87-3,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.754,3641.622,They deny that in their brief right here.
1987.87-3,2,35812,michael_s_fawer,,3641.622,3644.574,"Well, I don't know where they deny that."
1987.87-3,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.994,3656.013,The fact that it was Braswell who produced them.
1987.87-3,2,35812,michael_s_fawer,,3658.398,3661.667,There's... we're going back to page 34.
1987.87-3,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3710.933,3719.973,"You're saying if the Fifth Amendment prohibits it, then when Randy Braswell tells his lawyer or other agent to produce the document, he is testifying against himself?"
1987.87-3,2,35812,michael_s_fawer,,3719.973,3725.109,"If they can put that person on the stand to say that, yes they are doing that."
1987.87-3,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3780.661,3781.611,"Thank you, Mr. Fawer."
