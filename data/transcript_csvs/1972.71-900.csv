1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.144,"-- next in No. 71-900, Union Oil Company against the Tugboat."
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,47.463,53.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it pleases this Honorable Court."
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.814,228.31,What was the current of the river?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,228.31,228.608,Pardon?
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.608,231.014,"What was the current of the river in knots, do you know?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,231.014,236.931,"Just about a knot I think, according to the -- and downstream as I recollect from the evidence, with very little current."
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.837,469.21,How do you spell toolie?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,469.21,478.036,"T-o-o-l-i-e that's phonetically, that's -- I've never heard it before but this is what the natives were saying it was toolie fog."
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.21,513.238,"Does the record show the frequency of tankers of this size, draft and length --?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,513.238,515.246,Nothing at all in the record.
1972.71-900,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.318,544.458,"Incidentally, what is -- or does the record show what the Santa Maria's bare steerageways?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,544.458,545.755,Pardon Your Honor.
1972.71-900,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.755,555.851,"Does the record show what the slowest speed, the Santa Maria must possess in order to maintain their way?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,555.851,582.045,"There is nothing in the record although, the chief mate Mr. Aspland testified that as to maneuvering speed in the -- in the river, full speed ahead was 11 to 12 knots and half speed ahead was about 7 to 8 and slow ahead was 5 to 6."
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,583.505,590.946,Were there something in the record that they had difficulty maintaining steerage at five or six or below?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,590.946,605.382,"The master -- the helmsman had testified, and I think it's on page 73 of the record."
1972.71-900,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.263,627.975,Well are you -- by that statement indicating that half speed is the necessary speed?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,627.975,646.842,"Under these circumstances, the -- I think to be perfectly honest and frank about it, the record would indicate that at this draft at 31 feet and fully loaded, the vessel would be what they call smelling the bottom and it's pretty hard for it to steer at a low rate of speed."
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.374,687.732,What was the depth of the channel?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,687.732,697.001,"It's a 28 feet bridge I think Your Honor at this particular point, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.015,711.42,"It's a tidal river, isn't it?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,711.42,711.741,No.
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,720.688,724.1,What did you say was the depth at the stern --?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,724.1,725.881,That she was 31 feet.
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,741.111,745.328,We'll resume after lunch break but could you bear in mind that you've got some important legal questions to deal with?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,745.328,753.92,I realize that.
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,753.92,755.61,Mr. Roberts you may continue.
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,755.61,757.354,Mr. Chief Justice and this Honorable Court.
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.354,762.841,Now you could win -- you could win on all the facts of this case and not when if you --
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,762.841,763.902,"I will get to the legal issues, Your Honor."
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,763.902,765.151,If you don't --
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,765.151,766.556,I will clear up the record.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,967.769,975.69,Do you think the -- the rule that you're attacking in this case is any different than the rule of sight?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,975.69,976.914,No I don't think it is.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,992.391,994.393,"Well anyway, it's against the rule."
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1002.987,1003.576,I do.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1003.576,1006.281,And the other Circuits that are not applying the rule of sight?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1006.281,1006.517,No.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1011.568,1016.827,How about your opponent's contention that the rule of sight is -- was approved by this Court in the Umbria?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1016.827,1018.943,I don't think the Court said that in the Umbria.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1038.173,1044.086,"Under what standard they applied in judging the (Inaudible), rule of sight or not?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1044.086,1047.002,"In the Umbria case, I don't think it was the rule of sight."
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.095,1203.168,"What you're saying really is that in all the circumstances shown here, the master and the pilot of the tanker had a virtually an absolute right to assume that there wasn't going to be a U-turn by this tugboat and its tow."
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1203.168,1206.275,That's exactly what I'm saying Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.16,1237.703,"But in the -- but in the analogy you give if the automobile not engaged in any turn is going 60 miles an hour in a 30-mile zone, where would you be?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1237.703,1272.146,"When -- that's a -- and then there is under automobile law a prima facie case of negligence per se but under these circumstances, I think where you take into consideration, the steerage rate of the vessel, the testimony of the helmsman and also the quartermaster and the pilot, I think and the visibility that was prevailing other vessels traversing this Columbia River that under all of these circumstances, six to seven knots is not sufficient to show fault on the part of the -- the Santa Maria."
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1324.336,1328.109,Did you raise this -- did you raise this second question in the Court of Appeals?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1328.109,1333.625,"No, there was no reason to raise it Mr. Justice Potter."
1972.71-900,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.063,1354.351,"Well you might have, I suppose you anticipated the possibility of a reversal and I just wanted -- if you said and if -- if the judgment is reversed in any -- in any event, the 50-50 rule should not be applied."
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1361.969,1365.265,"No, they would not have listened to the argument I -- in my opinion."
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.163,1445.622,"But where do we stand -- or if we put it in the form of question -- another question, do we stand in the same posture here as failure of Congress to alter legislation when they have failed to adopt the Brussels Convention?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1445.622,1446.749,"No, I don't think so."
1972.71-900,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1497.574,1512.139,"Mr. -- we had a case here last spring involving the Erie Railroad Company where we were asked to overrule the Halcyon Lines case which I think was equally a judge-made law and as I recall, we declined to do it."
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1519.082,1521.998,I'm familiar with that particular case.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1597.448,1602.288,Now how does the share equally rule work now if there's --?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1610.404,1611.109,That's exactly --
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1611.109,1612.197,That's the way it works.
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1612.197,1631.748,"And -- and I think that type of a situation leads to litigation because you get a situation and I think lawyers, when they get amongst themselves and litigation and attend to be fair with one another and can be determined based on the facts, the relative degrees of fault of their two vessels."
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.418,1695.303,What were the relative damages here?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1695.303,1695.736,Pardon?
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1695.736,1697.718,What were the relative damages to the barge?
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1697.718,1699.759,They were fairly equal in this case.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1723.676,1724.286,(Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1724.286,1725.247,-- to the other side.
1972.71-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1725.247,1726.136,Yes.
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1726.136,1729.974,And that's what -- so I think unfortunate about such a doctrine.
1972.71-900,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.05,1802.632,"Mr. Roberts, does the absence of any amici briefs here by insurance companies indicate that they're quite content with the existing rule?"
1972.71-900,0,33962,kenneth_e_roberts,,1802.632,1803.738,I don't think that does.
1972.71-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.967,1832.761,Thank you Mr. Roberts.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,1836.752,1841.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.346,1891.872,"Well, does that mean that it must come to a complete stop as it approaches a fog bank?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,1894.293,1900.492,"No, because it would depend upon the standard visibility in the fog."
1972.71-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1915.36,1917.013,Some fogs are pretty dense.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,1917.013,1920.068,They're pretty dense and then you got to go pretty slowly.
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.068,1923.799,"Well, isn't the record here that these were patches?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,1923.799,1939.034,"It was patchy fog, but the tug and its tow for a time were completely concealed from the view of the tanker and that was find -- found by the Trial Court and the Ninth Circuit."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1939.034,1952.259,"But the experience of the pilot knowing the distance would not only be able to estimate the speed movement of the tug even unseen, would he not?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,1952.259,1960.873,"If he could be certain that the tug was going to stay where it was or maintain the same course and speed and not make any turns, that's the difficulty."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.873,1966.602,"But isn't -- now, why is that not a fair assumption on the record of this case?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,1968.541,1991.472,"It might be, but you never -- you never can be sure what you -- what's going to happen when you can't see the vessel and that's why radar is such an imperfection and why we have so many collisions despite radar that the courts had turn the coin radar assisted collisions because they see only the spot on the radar but they can't tell the course and speed and it gives a misleading sense of security."
1972.71-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.606,2009.538,"But in this particular case, even if there were no fog and this tug made that u-turn, what would have happened?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2009.538,2030.761,"If there had been no fog and the Santa Maria could see that tug at all times with the visible eye, and the tug made a U-turn in front of her in such a close distance that the Santa Maria could not avoid collision, I would think that it would be the tug's fault and not the Santa Maria's fault."
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2031.457,2038.252,"But probably -- probably and their dealing in ease, the tug would not have made the U-turn because I get --"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2038.252,2038.655,Absolutely.
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2038.655,2042.158,I get it from the record that it was confusion as to where the Santa Maria was.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2045.221,2045.647,That's --
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2045.647,2048.984,"And actually, they had to be on the port bow, didn't they?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2048.984,2052.745,"Not necessarily, there was a slight bend in the channel, which further confused --"
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.745,2054.812,There was a confusion caused by the fog.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2054.812,2055.578,Caused by the fog.
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2055.578,2057.6,That caused the tug to make the turn.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2057.6,2063.9,The tug in fact was taking an in extremis action because of the fear of eminent collision.
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.9,2071.135,Does the -- does the capacity and experience of the tug crew and master enter in to that somewhat?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2071.135,2073.288,I don't think this really has anything to do with it.
1972.71-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2167.929,2171.02,Why should the Santa Maria be --?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2196.843,2197.943,Well --
1972.71-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.943,2198.59,You wouldn't say that --
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2198.59,2198.843,The difference is --
1972.71-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2198.843,2206.347,"-- Santa Maria would have been negligent at all -- if -- if on a clear day, she maintained her full speed 12 knots."
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2206.347,2215.836,"Well, I think the differences Justice -- Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out, the very fog itself lends uncertainty to the whole situation."
1972.71-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2236.773,2242.157,"Well, it's rather unlikely to assume the tug is going to make a U-turn though?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2242.157,2245.577,I don't think you can be certain that it won't.
1972.71-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2245.577,2247.021,So this case proves that?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2247.021,2248.852,No.
1972.71-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.974,2321.023,"Mr. Wood, the tugboat not as in this case, but if he followed at that sight of rule and stop the barge would hit it, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2321.023,2323.072,If the tug followed the rule of sight?
1972.71-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.072,2327.578,"Yes and stopped, would the barge have hit it?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2329.134,2334.242,That the rule of sight does not require coming to a complete stop.
1972.71-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.424,2343.824,What is something that you have to stop to?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2347.407,2350.844,"Well, then the tug ought to be going pretty slowly."
1972.71-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2350.844,2358.61,"And the question is how is it going to slow down, people are running toward the rear end of the tug?"
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2358.61,2367.964,"In practical fact, if the -- if the rule of sight does sometimes have strictly applied, it would sometimes require you stop an anchor."
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2367.964,2369.102,"Yes, yes it would."
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2369.102,2376.602,Because the speed at which the rule of sight would require you to go and be too slow to maintain steerage way.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2376.602,2376.986,It could.
1972.71-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.448,2382.918,"Mr. Wood, before -- before you get this, let me ask you one more thing about the rule of sight."
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2402.983,2406.39,"Well, this touches on -- on this."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.97,2422.445,Would you raise your voice a little bit counsel?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2422.445,2422.703,Yes.
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2422.703,2425.29,I am not sure we can all hear you.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2425.29,2446.626,"I do not push this rule of sight to the extreme that in the middle of the ocean where you have an effective radar and you are sure that there are no other vessels in the area, in the vicinity at all that you have to at all times hold down to a rule of sight speed but this get -- I'm trying to answer Justice -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question."
1972.71-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.177,2501.993,"Would it be unreasonable to say here from the point of view of those expressed down (Inaudible) that whereas a collision on a port to port passing might have been anticipated in a fog, a collision that type that took place here really couldn't have been anticipated at all?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2501.993,2506.286,I think it would be a little unreasonable to say it couldn't be anticipated at all.
1972.71-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.972,2622.967,Are the other courts that -- why there are some courts who do not follow it?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2622.967,2624.041,"No, they all follow it."
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.041,2625.283,But Hess Shipping in the Fifth Circuit.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2625.283,2626.536,"Oh, I'd like to talk about that."
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.536,2628.9,That's a -- because we denied certiorari in that case --
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2628.9,2629.77,Yes.
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2691.889,2693.662,But she could have dropped her anchor.
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2693.662,2694.767,She could have dropped her anchor.
1972.71-900,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2694.767,2698.797,"Which -- which is a strict application of the rule of sight would have required in that case, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2698.797,2701.937,"Under -- under some decisions, yes."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.212,2784.177,"At five knots, would this collision have been avoided?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2784.177,2785.911,I think so.
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2785.911,2794.78,"When at seven, at running full distance between them, is there any evidence on that?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2794.78,2808.467,Of course the burden is on her under the Pennsylvania Rule but they pretty nearly missed and there is quite a difference in momentum between five and seven.
1972.71-900,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2861.574,2883.512,Do any of these cases treat the rule of sight as a presumption shifting the burden of proof perhaps and then leaving it to the Court to determine from the evidence whether or not the presumption has been overruled or outweighed the -- by the evidence in this particular case?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,2883.512,2889.735,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, I think that's perhaps another way of stating the Pennsylvania Rule."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3206.841,3209.304,"Will it eliminates one issue from the case, doesn't it?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3209.304,3211.361,It certainly eliminates one issue.
1972.71-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.289,3406.727,"What I suppose Brussels Convention could be resubmitted in the Senate, could it not -- could not?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3406.727,3407.61,We can do it tomorrow.
1972.71-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3407.61,3408.482,We can do it tomorrow?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3408.482,3409.218,Of course.
1972.71-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.218,3411.564,Any suggestion that maybe done or --?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3411.564,3415.843,Let's talk about it from time-to-time.
1972.71-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.863,3428.578,"By people, you mean insurance companies?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3428.578,3436.5,"Insurance companies, steamship owners, cargo owners, people if they wanted to get a law pass, there wouldn't be any great problem about it."
1972.71-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.5,3438.313,"Lawyers would love it, wouldn't they?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3438.313,3441.554,"Sure, I'd love it."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3441.554,3443.658,"We did it more than a half century now, hasn't it?"
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3447.75,3449.679,"You say it's been before Congress, yes --"
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3449.679,3449.811,1910?
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3449.811,3451.254,-- since 1937.
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3451.254,3453.476,"Well, but 1910 is when the Convention."
1972.71-900,1,23339,erskine_b_wood,,3459.224,3462.022,"I believe not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3847.505,3848.421,Thank you Mr. Wood.
