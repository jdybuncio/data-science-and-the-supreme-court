1986.85-2099,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.616,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-2099, Pennsylvania against Finley."
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,63.392,66.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-2099,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,228.62,233.665,Have you any knowledge as to exactly what his review of the record consisted of?
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,236.286,239.969,We know from his letter that he looked at the notes of testimony.
1986.85-2099,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,239.969,241.229,Is that enough?
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,241.229,246.462,Judge Blake indicated in his opinion that he looked at the entire record.
1986.85-2099,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.405,511.576,May I just interrupt for a second?
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,523.903,525.576,"--Oh, absolutely, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-2099,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.576,536.992,"But your view is that when they refer to the Pennsylvania law in this area, it is derived from Anders, that they thought they were compelled by Anders to apply the Anders rule in collateral proceedings?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,536.992,539.393,That is our position.
1986.85-2099,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.393,542.546,"Has any other state so read Anders, as far as you know?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,542.546,549.03,"Yes, the District of Columbia has so read Anders; has applied Anders on collateral review."
1986.85-2099,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.287,565.19,"In Iowa, Arkansas, and Texas, do you understand they did it because they thought Anders compelled them to do it?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,565.19,566.772,"Yes, I believe so."
1986.85-2099,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.772,567.143,I see.
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,567.143,568.263,"I could be in error, but I believe so."
1986.85-2099,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.394,593.52,"xxx prohibited from going further than Anders, is it?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,593.52,595.74,"Oh, absolutely not, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,600.235,610.621,"Mrs. Barthold, while you're interrupted, may I inquire whether the record reflects whether the respondent was sent a copy of the attorney's no merit letter?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,610.621,615.893,--The no merit letter indicates a carbon copy to the respondent.
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.775,770.355,"Mrs. Barthold, what do you think the Federal Constitution requires, at a minimum, through its due process clause, when the state has granted an avenue for state post conviction review?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,770.355,771.486,I think--
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,771.486,778.39,Must the state afford counsel at all to indigent defendants in that situation?
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,778.39,792.912,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, that they need not afford counsel except in those rare cases where, as a matter of due process, counsel is necessary, which is a statistically insignificant number of cases, I believe, even in the federal system."
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,811.942,815.955,"Well, you say the facts of this case are at least enough to meet it."
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,820.477,824.22,The state must provide access to the courts.
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,849.396,852.468,"And in some cases, it must provide counsel?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,852.468,867.458,--I think that would be a very rare case where it would be an idiosyncratic case where a court with prescreening would discover that there was something that would make it only possible for counsel to handle this matter.
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.856,886.665,"Well, in Pennsylvania, it is the practice to provide counsel uniformly for indigent defendants, I take it, in post... state post conviction review proceedings?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,886.665,888.314,--On any first petition.
1986.85-2099,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,895.517,902.633,"And given that as a factor, then what do you think due process requires, above and beyond that?"
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,902.633,910.938,I think due process requires that the attorney conduct a conscientious and meaningful review of the case and the record.
1986.85-2099,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.417,958.619,"Of course, Pennsylvania has control of that in its own hands."
1986.85-2099,0,24956,gaele_m_barthold,,960.46,972.678,"Yes, and I believe that that is something that might well occur, if not in Pennsylvania, in some of the other 23 states, if it is held by this Court that Anders must be applied on collateral review."
1986.85-2099,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.526,1093.2,"Thank you, Mrs. Barthold."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1095.44,1102.115,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court."
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.017,1173.389,"May I ask you on that question, a matter that was not raised on direct appeal of course wouldn't have gone to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1181.864,1184.937,--I don't believe it's a matter of what could have been raised.
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.282,1193.013,That means it was litigated in the trial court and no--
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1193.013,1193.742,And on appeal.
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.742,1195.204,--And on appeal?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1195.204,1201.549,"The distinction I'm drawing, Justice, is not... is between issues that were raised and which could have been raised."
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.559,1204.751,"On appeal, or in the direct proceeding?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1214.697,1216.359,--Only through the back door.
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1218.76,1220.349,Ineffective assistance of counsel?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1220.349,1220.85,--Exactly.
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.787,1230.797,xxx that should have been raised?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1230.797,1237.423,"Well, Justice Marshall, I believe in my brief, at footnote 7, I've listed several issues of arguable merit."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.967,1247.738,But the judge went through the record.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1247.738,1253.422,"The PCHA court says that they... yes, the court went through the record."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1253.422,1254.454,"No, no."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1256.294,1257.566,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1278.869,1279.729,If there's nothing there?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1279.729,1284.563,"If there's nothing there, which is not this case, Your Honor, he should follow Anders."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.563,1288.016,Would you make the same argument if there were 86 eyewitnesses?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1288.016,1291.647,"Your Honor, that's a tough question."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.647,1292.178,Would you?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1292.178,1295.23,I guess you're asking me whether there is a case where there are no arguable--
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1295.23,1302.285,"Would you make the same argument, if there were 86 eyewitnesses who testified that this person committed the crime?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1302.285,1304.315,--I would make the argument that Anders applies.
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.857,1309.528,I see.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1309.528,1313.231,"But I would make the argument that Anders applies, and one should file an Anders brief."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1313.231,1314.493,[inaudible]
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1314.493,1316.304,And in this case--
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.304,1318.455,Can you leave me off at 85?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1318.455,1321.116,"--Yes, I will, Your Honor."
1986.85-2099,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.759,1359.36,"Well, what do you think the constitutional basis of the Anders case is, Ms. Harper?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1359.36,1369.939,I believe that Anders does rest on the fact that there was a constitutional right to counsel in that case; but I don't think it was necessary for the holding.
1986.85-2099,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.718,1384.819,I just read the opinion and I had a hard time figuring out what the basis for the right was.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1384.819,1387.921,"--Well, I didn't see it discussed there explicitly either, Your Honor."
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.616,1412.978,"Well, wait, it's just a Pennsylvania right we're talking about."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1443.539,1457.058,"--I guess Pennsylvania could give that limited right, and the question would be whether that limited right is entitled to due process; am I understanding you correct?"
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.058,1459.168,xxx there.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1466.134,1470.305,This would be a different case if that were the Pennsylvania practice.
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.276,1476.24,Why is this Pennsylvania statute different?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1476.24,1480.151,"First of all, the Pennsylvania statute explicitly calls for counsel."
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.883,1529.385,"So you're saying although Pennsylvania need not provide for effective assistance of counsel, it could just provide to have some lawyer look over your case, if it does provide for effective assistance of counsel, whether the assistance is in fact effective is a federal constitutional question?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1529.385,1533.918,That's correct.
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.279,1581.048,"Ms. Harper, may I interrupt again?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1593.536,1594.618,"No, I do not."
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.981,1634.292,"It doesn't say, modelled after; it says derived from."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1643.879,1646.821,"I respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.781,1650.153,You wouldn't say it's at least ambiguous?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1650.153,1651.433,"--No, I would not."
1986.85-2099,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.616,1679.252,"You don't think if I said this rule is derived from Marbury v. Madison, that it couldn't be read to mean that I think Marbury v. Madison requires this rule in the present case?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1683.106,1688.372,"No, Your Honor, I think that this... I think this opinion's clear."
1986.85-2099,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.372,1689.991,"But your point is that they said, this Pennsylvania rule was derived from Marbury v. Madison."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1689.991,1691.514,"This is a Pennsylvania law, is derived from, is what it says."
1986.85-2099,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1697.668,1714.337,"But, counsel, haven't we said, in Michigan v. Long, that when the court doesn't make that clear, we're going to assume that they mean it's required by federal law, when the opinion cites federal authority and doesn't make it clear."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1714.337,1716.158,--That is what Michigan... that is what Michigan v. Long says.
1986.85-2099,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.433,1725.785,"Well, suppose that we disagree with you."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1730.279,1735.432,"--Well, then, if you disagree with me, it's not necessary to find that this rests on adequate and independent state grounds."
1986.85-2099,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.511,1755.284,"No, Ms. Harper, I didn't see any reference to due process in the Anders opinion."
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1766.771,1771.925,"It wasn't necessary in Anders, because it rested... arguably rested on a constitutional right."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.262,1904.202,What would you do with another lawyer?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1904.202,1906.734,--In this case?
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1906.734,1907.685,Uh-huh.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1907.685,1913.518,"I think what should have been done is apply Anders, so that--"
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1913.518,1917.491,So that... go ahead.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1917.491,1925.989,--So that the court could get to the merits of the case with the benefit of an advocate's marshalling of the facts and evidence.
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.771,1929.789,I see.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1929.789,1936.854,"So I think Anders would be the proper solution here, and that's what the Pennsylvania courts decided was the proper solution."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.854,1939.105,And what do you think Anders says?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1941.419,1943.67,"Yes, I think Anders requires a brief."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.67,1945.921,And he has to say more than he said in that letter?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1945.921,1952.295,"He has to say not only more than he said in that letter, but he has to avoid making an argument against it."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.431,1977.882,What would you do--
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1977.882,1978.342,--Pardon?
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.342,1994.403,--What would you do if the client said that my ground for appeal was that I was sentenced on count two before I was sentenced on count one; and that's the only grounds that I have for appeal?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,1994.403,1997.883,And counsel had conducted a careful review?
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.883,2000.695,And I warn you in advance that there's an actual case that that happened.
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,2000.695,2003.597,I can conceive of that case.
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.349,2005.701,And what would you do in that case?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,2005.701,2023.622,--I guess what counsel should do in that event is simply set out that she was sentenced on count two before count one; point the court to the appropriate sentencing rules and whatever cases construe them in their fairness; and point to whatever position there is in the record that might support the argument on behalf of the advocate; and let the court decide.
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.424,2030.535,"Well, what's the difference between that and this letter here, except that it doesn't have all the detail in it?"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,2030.535,2035.59,"Well, that's a big difference, because... there's a couple of differences."
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2036.211,2037.66,"Well, in this case, is it--"
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,2037.66,2040.552,--I was able to find arguable issues that don't appear in that letter.
1986.85-2099,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.552,2043.775,--Is it true that her only defense was an alibi?
1986.85-2099,1,19176,catherine_m_harper,,2043.775,2048.517,It is true that her defense was an alibi.
