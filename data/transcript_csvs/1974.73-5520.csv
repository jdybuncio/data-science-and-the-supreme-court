1974.73-5520,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.213,We'll hear arguments next in Cantrell against Forest City Publishing.
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,31.066,34.034,Mr. Chief Justice and members of Court.
1974.73-5520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.878,392.208,"Dayton, Ohio?"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,392.208,394.532,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.532,396.33,Those hardly the community.
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,396.33,400.04,"No, no, I beg your pardon."
1974.73-5520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.526,405.032,Story from what --
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,405.032,413.969,"The story about the community's reaction to the article, and that's an evidence if Your Honor please in Volume II."
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.918,480.145,And he went on then to --
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,480.145,480.53,Yes.
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,480.53,483.396,-- instructed the Time and Hill elements --
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,483.396,483.545,Your Honor --
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.545,484.849,-- can be established --
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,484.849,490.082,"He was really, not so sure as to what the law he had to apply in view --"
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,490.082,491.65,"I know, but right following what he --"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,491.65,493.755,But he did apply Time versus Hill because --
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.755,496.265,"I knew, and there was no objection to that, was it?"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,496.265,499.567,"As long I got to the jury in that court, I didn't object to anything."
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,499.567,501.293,But you prevailed before the jury?
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,501.293,502.603,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,507.33,509.462,But even under the Time and Hill test --
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,509.462,509.576,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-5520,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.576,510.329,-- you prevailed on the evidence?
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,510.329,519.443,"Yes, reckless, disregard as to the truth or falsity as the only basis for our recovery and the jury found that it was so."
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,529.437,530.49,"Mr. Sherman, before you do that --"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,530.49,533.446,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,533.446,536.629,There was a directed verdict as to a number of the minor plaintiffs --
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,536.629,537.038,Yes.
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,537.038,540.323,And why did they go out and one remained in?
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,540.323,556.721,"Well Your Honor, Judge Krupansky found that as a matter of law, these children were too young to know whether they were hurt, whether they have any interpersonal feelings about the invasion of their privacy, and therefore since we --"
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.721,558.368,"Well, he left William in, didn't he?"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,558.368,566.683,"William -- David William was 13 at that time and he testified how he was hurt Your Honor, the others were too young to testify."
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.414,573.443,"Well, Lolita Sue was 17."
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,573.443,574.082,Yes.
1974.73-5520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,831.012,834.119,"That concept is almost self-defining, isn't it?"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,834.119,834.665,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,834.665,839.717,"If it's printed in the newspaper, some editor has decided that it's newsworthy."
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,839.717,840.205,May I respectfully --
1974.73-5520,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.205,844.16,"-- it's not for the courts to review that judgment; it's a self-defining concept, isn't it, it's in the newspaper so its newsworthy?"
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,844.16,854.671,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I was a newspaperman and an editor for 16 years, and may I respectfully say sir that that is just not the way they look at it."
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,945.522,946.866,Mr. Sherman?
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,946.866,947.077,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,947.077,949.025,Did you say you filed a reply brief?
1974.73-5520,0,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,949.025,950.231,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1833.806,1838.715,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.272,1865.385,"Now, where is that in the record?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1865.385,1868.704,"Page 60 of the appendix, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1868.704,1872.237,Yes.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1872.237,1890.007,"At the close of the Blamos case and that's where the court throughout the claim of punitive or exemplary damages because of the absence of malice under the Time Inc. standard, but erroneously send it to the jury on compensatory damages."
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.007,1895.863,"You said under the -- you said lack of malice, what do you suppose -- you say he met the Time Inc. --"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1895.863,1901.464,"In the context if you read the record, this is the only malice we were discussing."
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.026,1929.391,"Now, the common law standard of malice is all that had to do with the punitive damages, that's what this was about, punitive damages and that depends as I understand it under the West Virginia and Ohio law upon proving conventional malice, i. e. ill will, which is quite a different thing from New York Times or Time against Hill kind of malice."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1929.391,1944.664,"Your Honor, if you will compare this Court's definition of malice in the charge he gave the jury with this statement, I think it will become apparent that he was not talking common law matters."
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1945.627,1948.048,"Then, why did he got to go to the jury?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1948.048,1949.701,He mistakenly felt --
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1949.701,1952.94,Why did he require you to go on with your defense?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1952.94,1953.772,I beg your pardon Your Honor?
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1953.772,1961.965,"Why did he require you to go on with your defense because if this were related to Time and Hill malice, that's the end of the case?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1961.965,1963.819,It should have been and that's what the court held --
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1963.819,1968.838,"But I mean the objection that going out of the defense, you went on with it."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1968.838,1970.683,We moved for directed verdict and we renewed it.
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1970.683,1978.012,"I know, but he said without ruling gentlemen Mr. Warder, you may proceed with your defense and you did."
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.771,1990.214,"Or after trial, he denied your, he granted in part, you moved and then denied in part."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,1990.214,1990.724,No.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.443,1999.868,Or I think more than -- that's even more clearer than he thought there's enough evidence for the jury.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2000.399,2003.144,"On compensatory damages, of course he did."
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.144,2007.455,"Well, that depended on the so called New York Times malice."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2007.455,2011.189,But this is the confusion that was in the trial court's mind.
1974.73-5520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.998,2035.674,Do you think the District Court may have foreseen our Gertz case before it was handed down?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2035.674,2039.142,I don't think so Your Honor in all fairness.
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.142,2042.475,"Well, does Gertz really had anything to do with this case?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2045.585,2050.812,"In generally, yes Your Honor as I shall come to that."
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.44,2083.114,"Well, that parsing it pretty finely --"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2083.114,2083.898,No.
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.574,2089.86,You're talking for a lay person who is not well educated.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2094.827,2097.69,"Well, that's the project from the other way Your Honor."
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2184.369,2191.961,"Mr. Warder, I noticed that the complaint sounds an action for malicious and defamatory libel."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2193.856,2195.607,That was dismissed and abandoned.
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2203.345,2206.657,Was there an amended complaint or is that the only concern?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2206.657,2207.767,That's the only one.
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2207.767,2209.365,I see.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2209.365,2209.996,Now --
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.996,2215.977,But everybody seems to agree that the complaint was in perhaps implicitly amended to --
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2215.977,2217.103,Right.
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2217.103,2234.774,"And I notice incidentally in the complaint that on punitive damages, the allegation is the said publication, maliciously, falsely, blatantly and scandalously by trace plaintiff's dissident, that’s a different kind of malice isn't it than the Time and Hill malice?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2234.774,2237.555,Yes it is.
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2237.555,2238.575,What page is that on?
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2238.575,2240.642,That's at page four.
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2240.642,2241.484,Thank you.
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2241.484,2242.808,Paragraph 6.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2242.808,2260.166,"Now, in a libel case in the light of Gertz, I have some doubts and so does the verdict lodged in the courts as to whether being a matter of public interest is any longer defense when we are discussing private persons."
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2385.7,2398.709,"Haven't you postulated a subjective test there, some things would ring a bell with some editors and the other editors wouldn't hear any bell at all?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2398.709,2402.332,"Well, if the alarm is there, he had better hear the bell."
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2414.382,2418.227,Then that's what you meant when you said the editors reads it that is peril?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2418.227,2418.566,Right.
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2418.566,2424.14,Because he's got to wait and see what the jury and what ultimately this Court --
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2424.14,2424.269,No.
1974.73-5520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2460.666,2469.548,"Well, are you suggesting then that even a right of privacy consistent with the opinion in Time against Hill violates the First Amendment?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2469.548,2486.12,I am contending that in a false like case -- well what I am really coming to Your Honor is I think the constitution prohibits a false like privacy case per se.
1974.73-5520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.12,2489.348,That would certainly go further than the Time against Hill?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2489.348,2490.601,It would go a little further here --
1974.73-5520,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2490.601,2492.529,It would go with the defense of Time and Hill?
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.529,2493.83,It will overrule Times against Hill.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.83,2495.671,Sure.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2495.671,2504.415,"No, Time against Hill was decided under a special statute where under truth was a defense."
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2510.032,2512.896,It was not very clear to me about your argument as you pressing this down.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2517.292,2517.857,I'm talking common law --
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2517.857,2522.692,-- or are you talking about the constitutional limitations upon the common law of defamation?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2522.692,2534.228,I am talking the common law of defamation and the constitutional limitation as I understand them on the cause of action for libel.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.941,2577.424,let me -- I think -- we might be talking about two different things without distinguishing them.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2602.804,2604.076,I want to make myself clear Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.076,2609.094,"Now, Time against Hill said there had to be at least recklessness with respect to truth or falsity."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2609.094,2609.788,Right.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.788,2621.717,Now this jury found that as was -- as it had it under instruction that there was at least recklessness in terms of truth or falsity.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2621.717,2622.373,Right.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.373,2629.195,"Now, you can be absolutely right in what you said so far, but you haven't gotten to whether or not there is an alarm bell with respect to truth or falsity."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2629.195,2633.295,I am thinking as to truth or falsity only.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.716,2673.997,-- why you distinguish between libel and the false like cases in terms of the constitutional protection.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2673.997,2676.568,I'm trying to make it the same Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.93,2702.713,"Well, this then you get the protection to that little time construction theory?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2702.713,2715.767,"Your Honor of course, I did and the jury let this and the Sixth Circuit held that there was no evidence upon which the jury if they use that verdict."
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.767,2719.246,"Well, I take it that the Court of Appeal is right, you win, but what if they're wrong?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2720.277,2721.496,That is a question.
1974.73-5520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.559,2727.083,Do you loose then?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2727.083,2740.64,"I think we would Your Honor, but I don't think the evidence is there, a reckless disregards or acknowledge of the falsity."
1974.73-5520,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2740.64,2751.87,Are you saying Mr. Warder that we are down to the issue in this case as to whether or not there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2751.87,2754.461,I think that we have to come to it.
1974.73-5520,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2765.477,2769.679,You do not object to the instruction given by the court as I understand it?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2769.679,2770.132,No.
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2854.11,2869.315,-- in this Court I think that properly analyzed indicate that the two guarantees are not cognate that you might very well get a different result under a free press case than you would under free speech case.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2879.225,2879.822,Generally --
1974.73-5520,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.822,2886.18,By definition it involves publicizing rather than merely an individual speaking?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2886.18,2890.818,Professor Hetmerg even makes that flat statement in his book on Torts.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2905.066,2907.685,"Mr. Warder, I have problem."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2913.472,2914.964,No Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2914.964,2917.02,There wasn't a trespass --
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2917.02,2917.869,No Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.098,2933.089,"Now, was this a state trespass case?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2933.089,2935.629,There's no trespass case at all.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2951.755,2955.924,-- the licensee when the mother wasn't there?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2955.924,2958.697,The children were there.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2959.303,2961.311,But they couldn't give license.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2961.311,2965.366,"They would, they were in charge of the property of course they can give --"
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2965.366,2966.488,Children could give license?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2966.488,2967.86,Certainly Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.86,2969.152,The two-year old?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2969.152,2971.25,"No, but the 17-year old --"
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.25,2973.44,Is that the law of Kentucky?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2973.44,2985.342,"Well, I don't know what the law of Kentucky is, but I know that if I leave my children with a 17-year-old babysitter, she's in charge of that house until I get back."
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.342,2987.166,And she can give license?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,2987.166,2988.172,I would think so.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.9,3000.121,But I thought the child said deliberately that mother is not here.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3000.121,3001.742,"He said the mother was not here, yes."
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.742,3007.217,Well I contend that as saying that the licensee is not here.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3007.217,3008.188,"No, they didn't say don't come in."
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.188,3010.127,The licensor is not here.
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3010.127,3011.937,They didn't say don't come in.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.103,3016.348,"They just said, but why did they say the mother was not here?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3016.348,3017.998,Because they asked for it.
1974.73-5520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.79,3022.902,And you don't think that was a trespass?
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3022.902,3024.504,Not at all.
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.504,3036.829,Well isn't this the case sounding in violation of privacy in the nature of trespass concept --
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3036.829,3038.4,Or of the old --
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.4,3040.777,-- you trespass on the person's privacy --
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3040.777,3043.169,Was the old common law concept of course.
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.765,3066.278,"Her whole complaint here is that your client trespassed on her privacy, in her household, in her family, in her tragedy, that's the essence of it, isn't it?"
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3066.278,3066.981,No.
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.372,3082.546,"Well, you trespassed and then published the results of what you found or thought you found."
1974.73-5520,1,42302,smith_warder,,3082.546,3092.81,"Well Your Honors, I see I have sometime left but I have nothing to add to these remarks and if there are no further questions, I waive my right to --"
1974.73-5520,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3092.81,3094.572,Very well.
1974.73-5520,2,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,3097.37,3105.212,"Just if Your Honor please, I want to point out that my friend's statement on the alarm situation."
1974.73-5520,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3123.171,3129.398,Does that become a burden after the jury has returned the verdict and to loose instructions?
1974.73-5520,2,28015,harry_alan_sherman,,3129.398,3129.999,No Your Honor.
1974.73-5520,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3169.002,3169.69,Thank you gentlemen.
