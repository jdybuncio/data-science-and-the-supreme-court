2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"Our last argument of the term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,11.472,16.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.103,64.156,The -- the -- the case is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass in the night.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,89.308,100.914,"I think that the Court could simply address what the Nevada Supreme Court did and tell it whether it got it right or got it wrong, whether there's a speech interest, and what -- whether that is subject to strict scrutiny or not."
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.304,130.283,"Well, if we -- if we say that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the governmental interests, even under the intermediate standard."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,130.283,130.801,I--
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.801,136.42,And -- and it just seems to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard of proof without deciding the case.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,144.308,148.846,"--I think -- I think you're right, Justice Kennedy, that it would provide more guidance to the Nevada Supreme Court."
2010.10-568,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,184.269,193.958,"As I understand the objection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but it's to the vagueness of this particular one."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,205.683,207.099,"That is correct, Justice--"
2010.10-568,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.099,211.218,So we're dealing not with can you have recusal rules.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,215.639,223.395,"--Well, that was the basis of the holding of the Nevada Supreme Court, was that those implicated speech rights and that all of them would be subject to strict scrutiny."
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.064,241.772,"But the -- the objection to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does it, assuming intermediate scrutiny?"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,241.772,253.044,"No, but I think that the -- our response to the vagueness argument is that Respondent concedes that the four categories for members of your households, relatives, employers, and business relationships are clear."
2010.10-568,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.553,268.939,But not in this context.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,275.426,283.782,"Well, first, I would disagree with the characterization of it as a catch-all, because it only sweeps in relationships that are substantially similar."
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,335.965,344.07,"Well, I found this statute very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain what's -- what I found a bit puzzling."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,361.849,374.609,"I think it would include the things -- the same things that are covered by ordinary -- every other recusal statute, which is very close personal relationships and relationships that give rise to a financial interest on the -- for the public official."
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,376.842,385.13,"Not -- not a financial interest of the public official, a financial interest of the -- the relative or the person who is substantially similar to a relative."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,385.914,393.153,"--Well, I think that in the case of the relative, yes, it's the financial interest of the relative, and that's why the very close personal relationship."
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,411.965,415.567,Maybe if I give you an example it will be clearer.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,423.44,424.106,Yes.
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,424.106,424.874,Okay.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,455.977,460.012,I think that the -- it would depend on a couple of things.
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,493.999,506.04,"Well, if I were a public officer I would find it very difficult to figure out whether a reasonable person would think that an effect on my second cousin's property taxes would require -- would materially affect my judgment."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,520.982,526.534,"Well, the way that that has been defined, and this appears -- this is not just a Nevada Commission on Ethics interpretation."
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.287,572.582,"Suppose that you spent your life in the civil rights movement or the right to bear arms movement or one or the other sides of the abortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this is your -- it's been one of your principal activities, not for pay, but just because of your civic commitment."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,589.794,591.043,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.065,604.767,They have coffee together every morning and they're in the same book club.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,604.767,609.755,"And even that, Justice Kennedy, applies with extraordinary rareness."
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.258,622.395,"Mr. Elwood, for me at least we've -- we've jumped way ahead."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,715.19,718.476,"Certainly, Justice Scalia, I would not think so."
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.537,740.355,You agree with Justice Scalia?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,740.355,745.059,"--I agree emphatically with Justice Scalia, except that I could never put it as well as he did."
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.059,750.697,You're ending up skirmishing on what seems to me a less significant aspect of this case.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,773.027,773.844,It is true.
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,790.588,801.546,"You modified your answer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of any case that applied the First Amendment to rules of general -- neutral rules of general applicability, I think."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,812.688,816.889,"I'm not sure I understand your question, Justice, but I think--"
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,816.889,826.411,"Well, if the First Amendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then you would have no First Amendment objection to biased rules of specific applicability."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,826.411,835.6,"--Oh, absolutely we would, because I think R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul speech that is subject to prescription can't be regulated in a viewpoint-based manner."
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.6,839.569,I thought your position was that this wasn't speech protected by the First Amendment.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,839.569,846.456,"But even speech that is not protected by the First Amendment, such as fighting words in R.A.V., can't be regulated in a viewpoint-based manner."
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,846.456,855.931,"So someone can challenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's not neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way to particular members of the legislature?"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,855.931,862.167,I think they could challenge it in a way -- alleging that it was viewpoint-based if it were only applied to Democrats or Republicans.
2010.10-568,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,868.821,870.821,"I'm not sure why you should concede even that, Mr. Elwood."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,886.198,900.958,"Well, in the event, Justice Kagan, that is how I interpret R.A.V., that it would not be an available option to have a viewpoint-based recusal statute that affected things differently depending on viewpoint."
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,900.958,909.296,Do you think that the rules in the House of Representatives allocating time on the floor or committee membership are neutral?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,913.683,918.254,They are -- I think that they're -- I think that they're neutrally applicable.
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.74,930.144,"Well, and if they did we would review it."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,930.144,940.6,"I think that any time you're talking about -- I mean, depending on what the house is, there's an extra measure of deference when you're applying, obviously, to the houses of Congress."
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.6,941.267,Isn't that nice.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,944.219,945.837,They certainly do come.
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.837,949.106,"Look, fighting words are words."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,966.717,974.34,"But in any event, all the Court even needs to get to is whether laws of neutral applicability would be covered, because that's all this statute is."
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,974.34,976.823,This statute doesn't apply just to voting.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,984.379,985.946,But that is essentially--
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,985.946,991.783,Advocating the passage or failure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary understanding of the concept.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,991.783,998.289,--But that is to essentially complete the disqualification just as under Thomas Jefferson's recusal rule.
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1007.811,1009.929,It doesn't apply to outside advocacy?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1011.763,1012.429,Absolutely.
2010.10-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1014.215,1038.764,"--But even if you have a law which is not directed to speech and is directed at conduct which is not speech, that law is still -- correct me if I'm wrong -- even under intermediate scrutiny, subject to invalidation if it has a chilling effect on -- on speech as an incidental matter, if that chilling effect is more than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the statute."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1039.449,1042.735,"I -- if it is reviewed -- I mean, it depends on the test you use."
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.096,1091.898,"The statute says ""or advocate the passage of""."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1095.017,1098.404,"But, Justice Breyer--"
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.404,1104.225,"And the -- I mean, the basic question is, again, do you agree with Justice Scalia's question, the import of it; or don't you?"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1104.225,1104.808,--But Justice--
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.808,1121.668,"If it doesn't apply, if voting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the law or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment; and if it is speech, then you get into some of the questions that were raised, is this too vague or is it not?"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1122.853,1135.16,"--Justice Breyer, I don't think we have to get as far as the position that Justice Kagan was suggesting, that I think Justice Scalia is suggesting, because we're willing to abide by R.A.V. and require neutrality in the regulations of this."
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.76,1138.093,"We might have to write an opinion, irrespective--"
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.345,1140.928,"You may be willing to, but I'm not."
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.928,1144.949,"--either it is speech or not, and so that's why we're asking the question, to get your opinion--"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1144.949,1145.632,--Right.
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1145.632,1149.234,"--which is an informed opinion, about how we should write that paragraph."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1156.072,1158.922,"I think you would say that it is not, that it is not -- voting--"
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.922,1161.173,"In that case, the most outrageous law you can think of--"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1161.173,1161.975,--Right.
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.975,1165.177,--in respect of voting is not covered by the First Amendment?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1165.177,1170.045,"I -- Justice Breyer, we again are willing to bite off -- we are willing to abide by R.A.V.--"
2010.10-568,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.045,1171.581,"No, I'm not asking for willing to do--"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1171.581,1174.366,"--It can be a neutral restriction on voting, which is not itself--"
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.366,1176.183,"Mr. Elwood, why is that extraordinary?"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1187.424,1188.626,--I think that that represents--
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.626,1195.53,Is there any greater violation of the principles of democracy than counting the votes wrong in the legislature?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1198.149,1199.949,--I -- I don't believe that it would be.
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.949,1203.2,So why is it extraordinary that this one should not be reviewable?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1203.2,1214.508,"Justice, I just think that there are certain things that you don't -- there's a -- there's a sort of principle when you're dealing with other branches of government that you don't look behind it when they certify things."
2010.10-568,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1229.001,1237.957,In several recent cases the Court has taken pains to make the point that it is not going to recognize any new categories of unprotected speech.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1253.283,1267.341,"But I think that if there's any law that has a better claim to -- to be added to that category, it's one that would be consistent with a law or a rule that was adopted by the first Congress 7 days after they first achieved a quorum."
2010.10-568,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1282.517,1305.732,"Counsel, just to clarify this issue, because I don't know that I've heard you state it explicitly, the second part of this recusal statute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which there's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is your position that's advocacy in the legislative body?"
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1305.732,1306.418,Absolutely.
2010.10-568,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1306.418,1309.953,So it's only limited to getting up on the floor and talking about that?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1309.953,1311.003,That is absolutely correct.
2010.10-568,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1318.024,1320.774,That person can still go outside and give all the press releases they want?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1320.774,1321.692,"Absolutely, they can."
2010.10-568,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1321.692,1338.236,What do we do with cases like Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that have recognized retaliation claims because of speeches given during the casting of a vote?
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1349.893,1370.557,"I -- I think they would be viable under the -- the way we are framing it, which is that basically if it's a law of general applicability that you could still bring a claim of retaliation, which -- those kind of claims are problematic for other reasons because there's a lot of what would be called retaliation that is itself protected by the First Amendment."
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.338,1421.341,"Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the protection that all of the legislators are subject to it."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1427.661,1429.811,"That is true, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.811,1433.732,And so it's sort of a self-regulating mechanism.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1434.199,1434.799,That's true.
2010.10-568,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.799,1441.553,--You have to be willing to abide by whatever -- whatever vagueness and whatever ethical rules you -- you have opposed -- imposed on somebody else.
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1441.553,1447.807,"That is true, and this law applied -- for the better part of 30 years, it applied to every legislator in the State of Nevada."
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1461.382,1477.242,"I suppose you would have a First Amendment claim under your theory if the generally applicable rule was applied in a discriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and look and over the last 2 years the only people who have been sanctioned for violating the ethics rules have been members of the minority party."
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1477.242,1478.594,I think that that is another one of those--
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1478.594,1479.778,That would be a viable First Amendment--
2010.10-568,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1479.778,1483.332,--Those sort of discriminatory enforcement claims are whole 'nother ball of wax.
2010.10-568,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.821,1521.707,"--Thank you, Mr. Elwood."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1527.861,1531.229,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1569.086,1584.345,"So if the legislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're going to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to pass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of someone in the minority, and you can challenge that on First Amendment grounds?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1584.345,1593.701,"I think not, Your Honor, because that is a way of organizing the institution that applies equally to all members of the institution."
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.701,1595.351,So does this.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1595.351,1606.359,"Well, this will -- this will single out individuals at any particular moment in time who are specifically isolated and told that that particular individual cannot vote."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1606.359,1609.711,How is that different from the minority people in the Chief Justice's?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1612.746,1613.746,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1614.396,1618.048,So it only affects somebody if they fall within the strictures of the statute?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1618.048,1625.654,"--And my -- my point is simply that this takes one particular legislator and says, you cannot vote."
2010.10-568,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1644.198,1655.09,"Mr. Rosenkranz, you are not -- is it right that you are not challenging any part of this statute except the one that -- that says ""substantially similar""?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1661.56,1663.012,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.736,1684.592,"Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a legislator?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1706.523,1708.124,"Here's -- here's what you can get out of, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.484,1726.169,Are you answering my question?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1729.804,1730.74,The answer is no.
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.74,1731.806,Why?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1731.806,1733.323,For two reasons.
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.955,1763.211,"What does that have to do with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of its prohibitions against vagueness?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1763.211,1781.673,"--The answer again, Your Honor, is when it comes to judges, we tolerate quite a bit more by way of chill of a judge's vote precisely because judges are supposed to act judicial and purge their vote of all extraneous effects."
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.673,1784.875,"That's too bad, because I would have been much more attracted to your position."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1786.041,1787.093,"I -- I understand, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1787.093,1790.278,"And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz, what about officials in the Executive Branch?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1800.134,1803.752,The Secretary of Defense has a First Amendment argument.
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1815.91,1832.188,"So all the official acts in the legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow saying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to worry about that, but official acts across the government are now subject to First Amendment analysis?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1832.188,1834.621,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that was this Court's holding in Garcetti."
2010.10-568,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1856.819,1861.005,What about the rules of civility in the houses of Congress?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1880.169,1884.537,"Within the chamber, Your Honor, no, if it's just the chamber that's sanctioning someone."
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1891.991,1892.791,"Well, I don't understand that."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1905.783,1912.854,"--And -- and so this is a rule, though -- we have to go back to what its effect is outside of the legislature."
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1922.96,1927.697,"Well, do you think that if there were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness aspect of this."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1950.193,1951.979,"--It would not be vague, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1958.483,1963.387,Because the -- the State -- what the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just like a business partner.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,1963.387,1965.32,And -- and the answer to that is no.
2010.10-568,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.466,2000.393,--no -- there's no -- I thought this -- the -- the only reason that we have this case is that the three-time campaign manager was -- did have a financial stake in this vote because the project was approved.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2000.393,2002.428,"--No, Your Honor, that's not why we're here."
2010.10-568,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.318,2045.941,But it -- it seems to me that if you're going to make this argument -- and this is the point we discussed with Mr. Elwood -- there are two ways to do it.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2071.239,2076.56,"--Your Honor, it is certainly correct that the latter is far narrower."
2010.10-568,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.039,2099.508,It doesn't seem to be different from the ones that Mr. Elwood read to us.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2105.229,2109.697,"Your Honor, he -- he cited one case from New Jersey."
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.995,2186.68,That's rather exaggerated.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2191.099,2191.582,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.219,2250.271,"--If that's what it means, you would think the legislature would change it, wouldn't you?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2250.271,2251.373,--Well--
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.373,2253.74,"I mean, it doesn't just hurt Mr. Carrigan."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2261.245,2262.578,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
2010.10-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.578,2263.264,So why don't we let them change it?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2263.264,2264.197,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.845,2323.284,"So why -- I mean, what the commission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal friend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the years."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2332.407,2332.907,That--
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.907,2346.066,"That's what it seems when I read that opinion, that they're thinking all these things combined is what causes this to fall within the category of a reasonable person might have doubts about the independence of judgment."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2346.066,2348.482,"--Your Honor, they gave a gestalt at the end."
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.482,2349.018,Yes.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2349.018,2349.918,They lead with
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.707,2361.326,That's part of it.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2400.415,2404.034,"--Because the difference, Your Honor, is judges are a--"
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.034,2407.069,"Oh, so you're saying that the difference is that we're judges?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2407.069,2407.938,--Yes.
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.938,2413.592,You mean Congress and legislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have exactly the same system?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2413.592,2414.025,So--
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.025,2415.242,And they have general rules?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2416.961,2421.079,"--The answer is no, not when it affects associational rights."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.531,2424.348,Did you argue associational rights below?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2424.348,2425.899,"--Oh absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2426.749,2428.018,Why do you think the court didn't address it?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2430.618,2432.803,--I don't know why the court didn't address it.
2010.10-568,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.602,2460.204,--Is there any catch-all that you would say would pass your constitutional test?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2483.253,2486.271,I -- it's hard to imagine one.
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.144,2544.458,"You didn't answer my question, which is since the Judiciary uses what's called the common law method, why is it impermissible for the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch also to use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating through example what a general -- what a general provision means?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2544.458,2550.544,"The answer, Your Honor, is the Judiciary does not engage in political activity outside--"
2010.10-568,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.544,2558.967,"Well, I -- so you're saying that one who engages has to use a -- a definitive rule-based method rather than a common law method?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2564.637,2575.345,--And the answer is that the candidate and the volunteer have to know ex ante whether to engage in this relationship or not.
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2575.345,2576.678,But why do they have to know ex ante?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2580.547,2581.013,And the--
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2581.013,2582.665,Mr. Carrigan chose not to use it.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2588.133,2593.437,"--Your Honor, the advisory process, the problem with it is that it comes too late."
2010.10-568,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.098,2623.79,"Well, I mean, but that -- but that's unworkable to say, you know, that every potential -- I think I might run for office next year and so I'm going to get advice from some committee as to who I can associate with?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2625.008,2626.475,"My point exactly, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2639.667,2642.886,"Counsel, I've kind of lost the thread of your argument."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2655.527,2656.963,"Correct, Your Honor; and it is both."
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2682.511,2685.446,"Is your vagueness argument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2685.446,2693.283,"It is a baseline vagueness argument on due process grounds, but it gets elevated because of the First Amendment interest."
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.283,2700.372,"So we can decide your vagueness -- if we agree with you on vagueness, we don't have to determine whether the First Amendment applies in this type of situation?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2700.372,2701.889,"Oh, that is correct, Your Honor, absolutely."
2010.10-568,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.889,2706.876,In the -- in the Nevada court you argued overbreadth.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2727.273,2730.991,"The answer, Your Honor, is that the Nevada Supreme Court shifted."
2010.10-568,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2772.135,2774.604,What's the standard for vagueness that we apply?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2790.264,2791.514,"--Gentile, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.693,2814.379,Here we're talking about penalty for participating.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2823.068,2823.601,I think--
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.601,2824.603,Is that problematic under--
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2824.603,2825.67,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2830.507,2830.924,--Right.
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2832.691,2835.309,"--A lot, yes; but a lot less so."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2862.562,2872.334,"If the relationship wasn't particularly special, no more special than any other political volunteer, why did that become front page news?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2872.334,2872.951,--Oh--
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2872.951,2883.641,"And if your client didn't have a suspicion that he was on the edge of a law, why did he bother going to the city attorney to get an opinion?"
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2883.641,2889.879,"--Because as he testified, and the commission did not disagree, this guy is a Boy Scout, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2922.783,2932.456,How will we ever write -- how will the Congress ever write a law that would be so clear that clients would never have to go to lawyers--
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2940.478,2945.382,"--Less so in the First Amendment -- I mean, more so in the First Amendment context."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2948.667,2951.369,But you're not -- you're not denying that most laws would be vague--
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2951.369,2952.052,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2952.052,2952.836,--Under that definition?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2952.836,2953.619,And there is a--
2010.10-568,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2953.619,2957.523,That lawyers disagree on the conclusion of what the law means?
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,2957.523,2972.716,"--And -- and there is a big difference between ambiguity of particular words and what the commission did here, which was to say we see these four categories, we are not applying any of these four categories."
2010.10-568,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3035.706,3037.558,"I'm not sure I understand that, Mr. Rosenkranz."
2010.10-568,1,32605,joshua_e_rosenkranz,,3047.114,3051.049,It would be subject to scrutiny for sure.
2010.10-568,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3165.507,3166.09,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-568,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3167.974,3178.746,"Now, my colleague argues that the Nevada recusal statute targets political association, and that is simply not the case."
2010.10-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3199.46,3226.477,"I think his argument is -- I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it, or at least I have this question, that an ethics commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, even in part, that an individual had a political association with him previously."
2010.10-568,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3226.477,3227.16,--I think that--
2010.10-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3227.16,3229.362,"It may be a new argument in this Court, I don't know."
2010.10-568,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3229.362,3232.964,--I think the fact that this happened to be a political relationship was incidental.
2010.10-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.739,3250.925,"Is that a new argument in this Court, as I've stated it to you?"
2010.10-568,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3250.925,3251.841,--I -- I don't believe so.
2010.10-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3253.008,3254.043,You made that argument below?
2010.10-568,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3254.043,3255.227,--That -- right.
2010.10-568,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3271.47,3280.925,I think Justice Breyer's question -- he can tell me if I'm wrong -- is whether that argument by them was actually raised below the way he is stating today?
2010.10-568,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3280.925,3282.041,--I'm sorry?
2010.10-568,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3283.377,3284.977,Whether that associational right of the political--
