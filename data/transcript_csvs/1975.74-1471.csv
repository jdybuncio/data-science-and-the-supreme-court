1975.74-1471,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,99.629,"We will hear arguments next in 74-1471, TSC Industries against Northway."
1975.74-1471,0,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,105.86,111.475,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.942,239.045,It does seem to me that there maybe one common element.
1975.74-1471,0,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,267.609,275.738,"Mr. Justice, I think that is rather well understood and I think a question of materiality is a question of fact."
1975.74-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.693,301.159,Judge McLaren’s holding was in a fact that it was reasonably debatable so he denied summary judgment.
1975.74-1471,0,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,301.159,302.368,That is true.
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1384.723,1390.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.598,1466.052,"Let me ask you this if I may Mr. Reese on the same kind of fact law distinction, is it not that the average juror probably in his good position to evaluate what is the first thing that will come to a Stockholder’s mind as the average Lawyer or the average Judge?"
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1466.052,1499.891,"Yes Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we certainly agree and we believe that he should be afforded the opportunity to make the decision, to make the judgments about whether this is a good deal, the underlying statutory policy as explained by this Court unanimously in Mills is not to substitute a judicial appraisal of the mergers merits for the Shareholder’s actual informed vote."
1975.74-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.047,1517.553,"Well, but if that is so, would not materiality normally be a question of fact for the finder of fact rather than the question of law?"
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1517.553,1536.275,"I think as Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question identified in the course of the last argument, matter of law is used in two distinct and very different senses."
1975.74-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.949,1586.203,"I do not regard that that is an entirely convincing answer because certainly in a typical negligence case or typical common law fraud case, you can have a stipulated documents, admitted facts and it still regard as a question for the trial of fact was the man negligent?"
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1593.846,1620.063,"Perhaps, Mr. Justice Rehnquist I can suggest that when we commit a question of that kind to a jury in a negligence case, we are saying our highest expectations in this field of behavior is the normal behavior of reasonable people."
1975.74-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.281,1644.43,"These questions of fraud in a fraud case to the jury thinking that properly charged as they should be, they will be able to make the assessment for themselves."
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1644.43,1655.294,"The certain kinds of question of fraud, common law deceit are ordinarily submitted to juries."
1975.74-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.776,1732.978,Do you think that the Court of Appeals have uniformly and literally applied Justice Harlan’s language since then?
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1732.978,1762.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think there is not the need for a revision of principles which this Court laid down clearly six years ago which it reconfirmed without question in the subsequent decision in Affiliated Ute Citizens versus United States and I think that the question --"
1975.74-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.511,1764.882,I thought that was my question?
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1764.882,1781.607,"Well, what I hoped to lead in to was the question of the Seventh Circuit’s decisions in this case and its relationship with for example the Gerstle opinion which used somewhat different phrasing."
1975.74-1471,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1865.852,1883.396,Justice Harlan’s language was directed primarily at other Judges or was it cast in terms to be used as an aid to triars of fact?
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1883.396,1903.644,"In cases where there is an issue of what occurred, an issue of fact in the historic sense, perhaps, that formulation would be inappropriate instruction to be submitted to the jury along with the determination of what occurred."
1975.74-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.905,1966.754,"Getting back to Mills for a moment Mr. Reese I sent forth and I noticed that at least as I read footnote four on page 381 of Justice Harlan’s opinion, he says that the respondents asked the Court to review the conclusion of the Lower Courts that a proxy statement was misleading and a material effect but this Court refused to pass on it because it was not raised by the petitioner."
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,1975.604,2001.779,"Yes I think it is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on this ground, there is a difference between this Courts scouring the record to determine whether the facts omitted from the proxy statement and found to be established without genuine controversy in the Lower Courts, whether those facts were properly found and existed without genuine controversy."
1975.74-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.043,2065.114,This Court did not review that holding in Mills.
1975.74-1471,1,27938,harry_b_reese,,2065.114,2067.384,This Court made that determination.
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3161.574,3168.894,Just a very limited matter to if the Court please.
1975.74-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.612,3255.524,(Inaudible) that if it rejects the statement that a reasonable man would attach importance?
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3255.524,3257.838,"No, I do not think so Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.922,3287.478,Would attach.
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3291.767,3294.141,I read --
1975.74-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.141,3305.731,"What they embrace is that if a reasonable man might have or would there be a significant propensity that a reasonable man would, not that he would as a matter of fact."
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3305.731,3308.949,Let me suggest to the Court that --
1975.74-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.949,3315.223,Well at least that is only a difference I see in the test they propose and the test that they reject.
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3315.223,3326.737,"I am hopeful that this Court will announce the standard of materiality on which the members of the Court and the members of the bar can agree as to its meaning, whatever your standard may be."
1975.74-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.493,3372.988,"Well, the District Judge (Inaudible)"
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3372.988,3376.308,"On those nitpicking items, yes Your Honor we would."
1975.74-1471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.308,3380.112,We just do not want; just think Judges are making mistakes.
1975.74-1471,2,31892,joseph_n_morency_jr,,3380.112,3402.759,Judges makes mistakes. Lawyers make mistakes but I think the number of mistakes made in this area can be substantially diminished once this Court lays down a test of materiality in plain language that we can all read and perhaps even use as a nitpicking omissions in this case as illustrations of that which is not sufficient as a matter of law.
1975.74-1471,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3402.899,3403.174,Thank you.
