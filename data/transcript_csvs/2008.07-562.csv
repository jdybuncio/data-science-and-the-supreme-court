2008.07-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.589,We'll hear argument first this term in Altria Group v. Stephanie Good.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,6.263,17.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' state law claims track nearly verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption provision."
2008.07-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,49.505,57.456,"Mr. Olson, what if the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the relationship between smoking and health?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,79.228,83.072,"--Well, I think the facts could differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,153.026,156.731,"Is it a question of just how you phrase it, Mr. Olson?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,214.361,215.316,I think that there is.
2008.07-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.312,265.826,"Mr. Olson, doesn't your answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the possibility of inserts like that?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,271.01,284.007,"--I think that's probably true in most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there might be regulations at the State level having to do with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to have to do with smoking and health."
2008.07-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,290.27,296.298,"So your answer then to my specific example would be the attorney general could not go after such a statement,"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,300.234,329.051,"--If -- if the courts were to conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there might be some case in which someone said, well, the issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with smoking and health, but in the environment in which this -- this statute was passed and this litigation was pursued, there certainly isn't any question here."
2008.07-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.76,365.285,"But suppose that a new drug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma -- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear that smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic reaction."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,371.126,378.718,"No, Justice Kennedy, to the -- the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, has full authority to regulate deceptive--"
2008.07-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.718,381.421,"No, I -- they've just found this out last week."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,396.976,401.238,"--Well, there could be -- the States may regulate the sale of items."
2008.07-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.395,454.669,"So, in your view, it says in Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in Cipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law where it's based on a prohibition of making a false statement of material fact."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,481.782,482.504,I don't--
2008.07-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,482.504,485.206,--if it's based on -- has something to do with smoking and health.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,485.206,496.309,"--I don't mean to be whimsical, but I think that, to the extent there's a representation with respect to growing hair or something like that, that may not -- it probably isn't -- have to do with smoking and health."
2008.07-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,496.309,502.649,"Well, I was trying to produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight ways."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,503.308,504.415,Yes.
2008.07-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.835,554.223,Excuse me.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,616.822,620.792,"--That is the argument, and the Respondents are making that argument."
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.779,770.151,"Mr. Olson, you're relying on 1334(b), I take it, specifically."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,770.151,772.479,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.431,783.928,But the prohibition you're talking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption argument -- 1334(b).
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,794.375,797.908,"I think it is, unless I misunderstood your question."
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.95,807.559,"The predicate for ""based on smoking"" is the word ""requirement""."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,815.635,819.695,"--Well, the statute contains the words both ""requirement"" and ""prohibition""."
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.796,847.9,"The question I'm asking, though, is a requirement that you make no false statements a requirement based on smoking and health?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,847.9,848.418,Yes.
2008.07-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.505,947.345,"Well, why -- why would Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side raises here is just what Cipollone said."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1004.024,1015.301,"--Well, the Court -- and this Court recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that pre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that the plaintiff puts in the complaint."
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.412,1061.268,But did the Illinois -- Illinois court reach the question whether the claim was pre -- pre-empted?
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1066.611,1068.046,"That's correct, and I'm not saying--"
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.046,1072.562,"So we must assume there was no pre-emption, because it wouldn't have reached the merits otherwise."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1072.562,1092.129,"--I -- I haven't got all of the specifics of that case; but what I felt -- I just simply meant -- but I think it's an example of what you said in your concurring opinion in Reilly: That if you're going to conduct a national advertising campaign, it can't be governed by what a jury might decide in Des Moines versus what a jury might decide in Birmingham, Alabama."
2008.07-562,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.566,1093.459,When it's not--
2008.07-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.459,1095.85,Is it the jury fracture?
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1118.229,1121.914,"--Well, no, that's absolutely -- absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.247,1169.725,"So your position is essentially that Congress, as -- as far as the advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one decisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't act then the cigarette companies can say anything they want about low tar and low nicotine?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1169.725,1183.327,"Well, there is also -- I -- I think it doesn't -- it's not dispositive of the pre-emption case, but there's also the master settlement agreement that the tobacco companies entered into with the States, which gives the States a lot of power to enforce various different things."
2008.07-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.259,1205.021,"Does the -- does the consent decree say anything about advertising low, light, those specifics?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1205.021,1206.3,--The master settlement agreement?
2008.07-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1206.3,1206.597,Yes.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1206.597,1208.207,I -- I don't -- I can't answer that question.
2008.07-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1259.154,1270.321,"But, Mr. Olson, isn't the problem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least been assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of reasoning that holds against you?"
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1335.577,1336.653,"Well, the point--"
2008.07-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1336.653,1342.168,"And all I'm saying is what we have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1351.475,1358.755,"--Well, the -- the statute deals with this to a degree in section 1336 by saving certain responsibilities."
2008.07-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1374.217,1380.448,"Well, it's part of a national scheme, but in practical terms you can say that on any subject matter that the FTC regulates."
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1394.162,1394.693,"--Well, no."
2008.07-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1406.563,1413.86,Your implied -- your implied preemption argument would certainly fall prey to that -- to that point.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1413.86,1419.857,"--Well, it -- we have -- I'd like to spend no time on the implied preemption argument--"
2008.07-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.857,1420.372,Good idea.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1420.372,1426.727,--because I think -- I think this is the -- the -- that Congress could not have been more clear.
2008.07-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1441.659,1442.922,Perhaps we did not think of it.
2008.07-562,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1442.922,1450.999,"--I don't -- I think that it's clear that, looking at the briefs in that case, that those very same arguments were made."
2008.07-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.733,1526.594,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1534.557,1557.797,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the Labeling Act, the 1969 Labeling Act, it gave no intention whatsoever to immunize cigarette makers for the false statements that they made in violation of anti-deception in the marketplace rules."
2008.07-562,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1573.637,1607.373,"Mr. Frederick, suppose that the FTC had adopted the rule that it considered in 1970 and required that the tar and nicotine figures that were produced by the particular testing method that is at issue here to be placed on all cigarette ads and promotions; and then suppose that Maine issued a regulation requiring that all ads and promotions in the State of Maine state that the Federal figures are misleading and should be disregarded."
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1609.138,1613.385,"--That would be implied conflict pre-emption, and we would acknowledge that would be pre-empted."
2008.07-562,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1614.571,1616.556,What's the difference between that situation and this situation?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1616.556,1635.487,"--The difference here is that between a generally applicable rule that is specially targeted at the cigarette industry and a generally applicable rule against deception, upon which a fact finder would not need to make any special inquiry about smoking and health."
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.487,1639.968,"How is that consistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case where they said, and I'll quote:"
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1653.855,1656.182,"Well, I have three responses, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.763,1686.84,You say Riegel wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1695.493,1707.66,"--And the result, Mr. Chief Justice, of virtually every one of this Court's pre-emption cases has been to look at the particular words of the statute to determine the scope of the pre-emption."
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.378,1728.012,"So as a general proposition -- I understand your position to be that this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in response to Justice Alito's question was that general common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored ones are."
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1728.012,1728.464,--No.
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.464,1732.605,You agree that a general common law duty can be pre-empted by a particular statute?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1732.605,1734.914,"I do acknowledge that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1760.342,1765.528,So you're -- so you're saying that we should -- the difference in your case is that the language here is narrower.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1771.101,1778.428,"--No, I think you're quoting 1334(a) and the pre-emption provision at issue here, Mr. Chief Justice, is 1334(b) which says--"
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.428,1778.818,Okay.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1785.409,1795.78,"--Well, no, it isn't, because the modifying term that's at issue in this case comes between the two points that you quoted, and that's the phrase ""based on smoking and health""."
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1805.572,1811.149,How do you tell -- how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you don't look at what the relationship is between smoking and health?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1820.145,1820.754,"No, you don't."
2008.07-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1828.471,1830.595,That's the relationship between smoking and health.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1830.595,1845.745,"--And the word 1334(b), and that is crucial because this Court in Safeco v. Burr defined the phrase ""based upon"" to mean but-for causation: But for smoking and health, is there a requirement?"
2008.07-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1858.957,1867.579,Would you have -- would have you been satisfied if your complaint said this complaint does not seek any damages based on the link between smoking and health?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1867.579,1877.998,"Well, the damages here, Mr. Justice Kennedy, are -- concern getting two products that are not different."
2008.07-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1881.418,1890.539,"Would you accept that amendment to your complaint, that the plaintiff does not seek any damages based on some link between smoking and health?"
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1890.539,1892.91,"--I think we would accept that, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1892.91,1897.021,How can you accept that and then expect to prove damages in the case?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1940.909,1943.955,In fact in our case we are not proving health-related damages.
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.955,1947.39,"No, but you're asking for injunctive relief, I guess."
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1947.39,1948.997,"No, we are not asking for injunctive relief."
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1956.153,1971.957,"And the reason -- and the reason the product is of different value is that in fact it is dangerous to health, as opposed to -- or more dangerous or equally dangerous to health as opposed to less dangerous to health; so that at the causation stage you've still got to prove the link between causation and health."
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1971.957,1973.49,"I don't think so, Justice Souter."
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1981.063,1989.544,Do you think you could recover if the evidence showed simply that all your clients had the health of Olympic athletes?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1989.544,1990.589,Yes.
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1990.589,1991.388,You do?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1991.388,1994.902,"Yes, I do, because our damages here, Justice Souter--"
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.902,1997.055,"What would the harm be, sort of aesthetic?"
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1997.055,2005.021,"--If we bought a product thinking that it would be a safer product and it was not, and we would have quit smoking."
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2005.021,2008.85,"If they are healthy as horses, you have no proof that it is not."
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2008.85,2011.674,"We're -- yes, we do, because the product is different."
2008.07-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.5,2021.687,But what if Yugos and Fords are worth the same amount of money?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2021.687,2023.937,That is an economic proof--
2008.07-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.937,2024.826,But that's the thing here.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2035.667,2041.899,"--There is economic evidence, Justice Scalia, of a difference in value, and of course the pre-emption -- the issue here is not--"
2008.07-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.899,2042.398,Answer my question.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2044.347,2046.254,--They did not charge more for light cigarettes.
2008.07-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2046.254,2047.221,So what are your damages?
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2047.221,2049.362,"Yes, what's the difference in value?"
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2049.362,2065.077,"Economists have projected that if a person would have quit smoking and, therefore, not purchased light cigarettes or would have paid a different amount of money thinking it was getting a safer cigarette, there is an economic value--"
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.077,2067.92,Why would the person have decided to quit or not to quit?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2072.213,2073.711,--Certainly.
2008.07-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2076.055,2080.555,So -- you are proving a point which depends upon the relationship between smoking and health.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2080.555,2095.782,"--Justice Souter, I don't think that the liability requirement here, the rule of law that is being imposed under Bates -- what Bates said was that you look at the elements of the claim to determine whether or not the requirements are imposed by State law."
2008.07-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2100.06,2115.9,"Well, why couldn't you say exactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to protect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule, and the rule is not only the cigarette company do you have to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you have to put skull and crossbones?"
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2138.061,2145.746,--We are not making the same argument here for two reasons: One is that the main statute is not specially targeted at cigarette smoking.
2008.07-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.743,2157.991,Excuse me before you go.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2168.079,2171.393,--The statute we seek to invoke is a--
2008.07-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.393,2179.559,It's a general statute but in Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at what its specific application in the case was.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2179.559,2180.139,--Because the statute--
2008.07-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.139,2185.997,You can't get away with just coming in and saying the general statute is an anti-deception statute.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2188.918,2204.396,"--You looked at it because the statute required you to look at it as applicable, and the purposes behind that Act were to give the FDA authority at the premarketing -- and purposes behind the medical device amendment were completely different."
2008.07-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.267,2211.671,That's what I want you to get you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds.

2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2325.534,2329.921,We are not here seeking injunctive relief for this--

2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2391.367,2400.783,"--The consent decree in the master settlement agreement does not address itself to specific issues with regard to light and low tar, to my knowledge."

2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2480.906,2494.684,"I think that would fall into the Reilly line of being preempted, because it would be specially targeted and there would be no room for a cigarette maker to say truthfully our product actually does yield lower and light."
2008.07-562,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2502.382,2509.522,Weren't the claims that were held to be preempted in Cipollone based on general common law duties?

2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2573.336,2578.613,"The requirement is what I would urge you to focus on, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.039,2617.19,Do I understand your basic argument to be that this statute is a prohibition against State warnings in either promotion or advertising different from the Federal one?
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2617.19,2618.141,That's correct.
2008.07-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.096,2630.276,This specific quotation deals only with the contents of the advertising that might be described as warnings different from those in the Federal scheme.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2630.276,2631.887,"--That's absolutely correct, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.118,2650.582,Your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question was that the state attorney general could not impose a regulation that said you must say that low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular cigarettes.
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2655.658,2659.032,"Well, the attorney general could bring the same suit that we bring here, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2661.22,2661.688,No.

2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2699.797,2713.195,"--I think that's a much more difficult hypo, but I think the answer is the same and that would be no, because a regulation would be -- would be specifically targeted at the industry and it would be based on smoking and health, not deception."
2008.07-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.988,2733.516,"Well, can you make that concrete?"
2008.07-562,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2738.593,2761.444,"If the -- if the company came forward and said, ""we redesigned our cigarette"", and it in fact does yield less tar and nicotine under a scientifically verifiable test, that would be -- that would run afoul of the regulation, but it would not run afoul of the general duty not to deceive."

2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2793.663,2810.828,"--Your Honor, the United States did not participate on the question of the scope of the express pre-emption provision in Cipollone, and to a large extent the express pre-emption question in this case is what was the meaning of the decision in Cipollone."
2008.07-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.295,2823.826,All right.
2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2843.736,2851.453,"Your Honor, the United States has not taken a position on the bottom line of the first question presented."
2008.07-562,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.453,2854.592,Petitioner says you have in an earlier case.
2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2854.592,2863.9,I don't believe that the position that the United States stated in Reilly is dispositive of the first question presented in this case.
2008.07-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.682,2871.821,"Well, it's not anymore."
2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2876.523,2877.366,"Well, I--"
2008.07-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2877.366,2880.301,"Implied pre-emption is all that you address, right?"
2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2880.301,2881.3,--But we--
2008.07-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2881.3,2883.3,So it should be pretty easy for you to win on that.
2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2883.924,2886.358,--I would hope so.
2008.07-562,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2901.321,2914.801,Does the FTC at this point in 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and nicotine figures that are produced by this testing method are meaningful or misleading?
2008.07-562,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2914.801,2942.226,"--Well, as Your Honor is aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority letter that in July of this year the Commission issued a request for comment on a proposal to rescind its guidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test results, precisely because of concern that they are misleading due to the evidence that has developed about the incidence of compensation."
2008.07-562,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2984.364,2997.969,"Would it be -- would it be unfair to say that for quite sometime now, nearly 40 years, the FTC has passively approved the placement of these tar and nicotine figures in advertisement?"

2008.07-562,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.88,3287.065,Can I ask a question?
2008.07-562,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3320.865,3323.147,This is in the Reilly case.
