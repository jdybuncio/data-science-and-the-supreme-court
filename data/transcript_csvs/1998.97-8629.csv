1998.97-8629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.829,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-8629, Eddie Richardson v. the United States."
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,54.627,56.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-8629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,77.934,81.224,And... and what is the principal authority for that proposition?
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,81.224,83.287,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1998.97-8629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.287,84.897,What is the principal authority for that proposition?
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,85.868,86.269,Winship.
1998.97-8629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.853,106.521,"Yes, but I had thought in... in Schad there was some indication that different jurors can be persuaded by different pieces of evidence so long as they all agree on the bottom line."
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,115.069,115.497,"--Well, the--"
1998.97-8629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.497,117.22,--if they agree on the bottom line.
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,117.22,123.214,"--The question I guess is what is the bottom line, and the bottom line in--"
1998.97-8629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.214,127.107,Guilt or not guilt of the charged offense.
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,127.107,129.268,"--Yes, but the offense is defined."
1998.97-8629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.977,166.561,"And if it's part of a continuing series of violations, and it doesn't say how many or what."
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,174.426,177.418,"--Well, if you cannot pin it down--"
1998.97-8629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.418,180.841,"Well, Congress didn't seem to pin it down."
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,180.841,181.512,--Congress--
1998.97-8629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.512,189.147,"Now, in RICO you've got a much more precise scheme spelled out than here."
1998.97-8629,0,44046,william_a_barnett_jr,,195.079,197.312,"--Well, you're correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1780.389,1790.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-8629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.442,1821.226,And what... what is the best authority for that from this Court?
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1821.226,1839.248,"The Schad case and the cases that precede Schad establish the basic controlling principle here, which is that the only thing that a jury has to be unanimous about is the elements of the offense and the jurors do not have to agree on the evidence that support each element."
1998.97-8629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.93,1864.295,And six jurors could think that the drugs were sold at high school 1 and six jurors at high school 2 and that would suffice?
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1864.295,1866.996,Now you're talking about for a CCE?
1998.97-8629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.996,1867.317,Yes.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1867.317,1874.35,"Well, you... you would have to show a continuing series, and I'm not sure that just one... one event would do it for a continuing series, but--"
1998.97-8629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1874.35,1874.49,No.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1876.411,1876.601,--Right.
1998.97-8629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.601,1878.824,--at high school 1 and a series of transactions at high school 2.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1878.824,1879.024,Right.
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.914,1896.994,Suppose that half the--
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1905.922,1906.142,Right.
1998.97-8629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.142,1909.316,"--just the opposite, that it didn't happen at all in high school 2, but it happened at high school 1."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1909.316,1911.576,"Justice Kennedy, that... the same result would follow."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.833,1954.275,But it isn't just a question of intent.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1986.846,1987.337,"No... no, it--"
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.337,1988.606,So long as it intends to do it.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1990.349,1991.669,"--You were right to correct me, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.238,2024.45,What if the series... you say so long as it's rational.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2038.462,2039.613,"We do not agree with that, Justice--"
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.613,2040.575,You don't even think you need 12--
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2040.575,2041.143,--We do not agree on that.
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.143,2043.226,--You don't have to have this jury agree about anything.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2043.226,2047.688,"They do have to agree about the elements of the offense, but not the facts underlying it."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.025,2059.606,It sure does.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2059.606,2077.498,"But when you read it in the context of the whole statute, which is... the following sentence says that that's just part of a series of violations, it's best understood as really the functional equivalent of saying, there must be a series of violations at least one of which took place within the statute of limitations period."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.498,2094.938,"So, you... you think Congress could enact a statute which says, anyone who is guilty of a series of burglary shall go to jail for so many years, and if you put the statute that way, you would not have to prove to the satisfaction of 12 jurors any burglary."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2094.938,2096.65,"Well, you'd have to prove a series, but the--"
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.65,2098.003,You'd have to prove a series.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2098.003,2098.13,--Correct.
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.13,2110.519,"Three think this burglary, three think another one, three think a third one, and three think a fourth one, and this fellow goes to jail even though, beyond a reasonable doubt, no 12 people think he did anything that was illegal."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2110.519,2116.183,"Well, first of all, a series... presumably they would all have to agree that there were at least three or at least two depending on how you defined a series."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.727,2141.23,Schad was decided mostly on the basis of tradition.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2188.152,2196.787,"Justice Scalia, I'm not sure about the background that you're speaking of, but I don't think it's fair to compare this statute to a recidivism statute."
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.849,2259.661,--May I give you this... this hypothetical?
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2288.361,2291.984,"I have to work through that hypothetical a second, Justice--"
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.984,2294.338,"Well, each is a continuing criminal enterprise."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2302.762,2303.954,--And then there's one overriding--
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.954,2304.643,--And then there's one overriding.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2304.643,2304.894,--One overriding--
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.894,2306.797,And they could be... and they charge all four.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2306.797,2307.034,--Right.
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.034,2314.761,"The jury could be not convinced on any one of the first three, but enough... you get a combination to convict on the fourth, and that would be okay."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2314.761,2316.341,"That's possible, and... and that is possible--"
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.341,2318.103,That is consistent with your theory.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2318.103,2323.156,"--It is but it's highly unlikely, Justice Stevens, that anything like that would ever happen, but if it did, it would be--"
1998.97-8629,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.156,2330.07,"Well, except you have one witness on each of them and six of them think this guy is unbelievable and six think the other guy is... so, I don't think that's so totally impossible."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2330.07,2350.736,"--Well, I would... I would... I would question that, but if... if that unusual thing did happen, it would... you would... you would convict for the same reason that there's a conviction when six jurors think that there's a robbery and they're convinced beyond any doubt that there's not intent to murder and... and six are convinced that there's an intent to murder and convinced beyond any doubt that there's no robbery."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.315,2372.599,"Those are all means and manners, but why can't we adopt the rule that where an element of the statute requires the commission of a crime, you need to have... or a series of crimes, you need to have 12 tried and true jurors find that in fact a crime was committed?"
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2372.599,2373.991,--I just don't--
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.991,2394.905,"Once you say that an element of it is a crime, a whole crime, not just intent, not just any of the manners or means, but a completed crime, once the Government wants to get somebody and impose an additional penalty for a crime, whether it's an individual crime or a series of crimes, you need 12 people to say there was a crime here, here, and here."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2396.836,2397.307,"--Justice Scalia, I--"
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.307,2399.848,What classic statutes would that harm that--
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2399.848,2406.223,"--Well, I think what it would... would harm are the modern statutes and... for which there are no precedent and because--"
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.223,2411.234,--we're exactly answering whether we should let these modern statutes proceed.
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2426.354,2426.735,--You could.
1998.97-8629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.846,2436.983,"--Or you could say he did it through assault, which is a crime, and some of the people say it was assault and some of the people think it's extortion."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2466.392,2488.057,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just think that illustrates that there's really not a... a strong principle behind it because even if you take Schad, I'm not sure what the distinction is when you say, robbery is a separate offense, but we'll move robbery in as part of murder and say half of the jurors only half defined it and then they found an element of the offense."
1998.97-8629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.057,2488.666,How do you--
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2585.999,2588.232,I don't see the distinction.
1998.97-8629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.861,2604.763,"Yes, but you... you apply... well, that's right."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2642.276,2646.84,--But Schad announced a principle that was broader than just the means.
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.767,2694.093,"--Well, should rationality include... include whether it... it simply deprives the jury of its historic function?"
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2727.325,2727.764,As I said--
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.764,2730.388,Is that... is that an irrational definition?
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2730.388,2744.556,"--Well, it may be if there's not a distinctive form of criminal activity that's being addressed, but there's a big difference between just requiring proof of a series, as in your hypotheticals, and requiring proof of a conspiracy from which the defendant--"
1998.97-8629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2744.556,2754.881,What if a defendant is charged with speeding on the... on or about such and such a date at the intersection of 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue?
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2772.753,2773.334,"--They can, yes."
1998.97-8629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.84,2800.392,What about the Hobbs Act or the Travel Act?
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2857.823,2862.275,"Well, one thing you have to decide is what is Congress defining as the element of an offense."
1998.97-8629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.275,2863.057,"Well, that defines--"
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2863.057,2877.676,"In some... in some cases there could be two... two separate acts, each of which... for example, if you take a drug distribution, each drug distribution is a separate offense that is charged and punishable as such."
1998.97-8629,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.35,2885.731,"--No, no, but that isn't the problem."
1998.97-8629,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2885.731,2887.773,Here in this case what we have--
