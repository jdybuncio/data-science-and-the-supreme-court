1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-957, Melvin Jefferson v. The City of Tarrant, Alabama."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,9.888,12.776,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,36.61,39.062,Are you going to address the jurisdictional issue?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,39.062,40.562,"I will, if... Your Honor."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,40.562,41.874,I think you should.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,41.874,59.055,"The Federal issue has been totally adjudicated by the supreme court of Alabama, and under the Cox case this Court has held an exception, or held that jurisdiction is found where there's no further Federal issue to be adjudicated and cannot be adjudicated at the lower court."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.055,71.69,But the Federal issue could become academic if you go back and on the State claim there's a determination that there was no wrongful conduct on the part of the city.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,71.69,94.291,"Under... in Cox it's my understanding, Your Honor, is that the Court held this exception: where the Federal claim has been finally decided and with further proceeding on the merits in the State court to come, but that which later review of the Federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.681,110.268,"But here you could conceivably, if you should prevail on the State claim you could then bring up that you should also have had a 1983 claim."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,110.268,111.471,I don't believe so.
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.938,128.542,"And they would then say, it's law of the case, and so we deny... in dealing with the appeal you would have a final disposition, and you could come here again."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,132.088,142.286,"I think it is different, but I think the rational of Cox is, looking at this particular issue, this Court... the Alabama supreme court has adjudicated it to the fullest degree under the Federal issue."
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.286,147.488,The issue isn't whether they have adjudicated it finally and will not come back to it.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,165.278,173.165,"It would require duplication in trying the case twice, and I think that's part of the rationale that Cox looked at."
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.165,173.446,Sure.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,191.486,199.06,"It could, but the problem, Your Honor, is that the third element in Cox specifically, I think, addressed that rationale."
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,202.903,219.49,"But it says where further Federal... it says, but in which later review of the Federal issue cannot be had, and under the law of the case, Alabama could conceivably change its mind if there were some intervening decision, perhaps by the Eleventh Circuit."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,239.137,247.291,"Well, I think, though, the rationale in exception 3, if it does not meet this case, it should meet this case, and maybe the Court should accept that as a further--"
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.291,261.988,"I think perhaps the rationale of section 3 was your... a case called California v. Stewart that was decided on... where the State court says, this evidence is inadmissible because it was violative of Miranda."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,288.774,300.769,"--I think that, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe that we will, because I think the supreme court of Alabama has reviewed the issue and has accepted it for that particular purpose."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.769,318.215,"Let's assume that, as I think my colleagues have assumed, that the supreme court of Alabama is going to say, as Justice Ginsburg, this is the law of the case, we've decided it, but this is simply a necessary step for you to then bring the case to us, and you will not have the final judgment argument made against you at that time."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,318.215,327.617,"If that rationale holds, then this case would be tried once with a State remedy, which would exclude the entire 1983 cause of action."
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.359,348.25,"Well, that's always--"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,350.795,351.874,That's true.
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.874,352.841,"And then the whole thing could be washed out, right?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,352.841,353.122,That's true.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,353.122,357.854,The problem is that's always true when you take an interlocutory appeal.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,357.854,358.667,That's correct.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,358.667,368.757,"It's always true, so the statutes balance and allow you sometimes to take an interlocutory appeal, sometimes not, but we have a statute here that doesn't allow it."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,378.27,378.956,Well--
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,378.956,380.081,So how do we get around that?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,380.081,391.184,"--I personally do not believe the supreme court of Alabama will adjudicate the same Federal issue again, and the reason is the defendants in this case are going to say, this case is already decided."
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.384,403.774,We don't resolve finality issue by issue.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,417.972,418.722,--The State claims are.
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.722,437.401,"So the only way you can get out of the problem is to say, this comes within one of the exceptions, to wit, there's no other way to appeal this Federal claim unless I can appeal it now, which was the situation in the case that the Chief Justice described, but I don't see why that's the situation here."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,447.694,457.174,"I believe the Court could expand, if that's the term, in the Cox rationale and to allow this particular appeal."
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,457.174,459.408,"--Yes, but how could... I mean, it's like a trial judge."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,462.406,462.953,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,462.953,467.498,"You run up to the court of appeals, you say, you know, judge, an awful lot of time and effort's going to go by."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,482.211,482.664,Right.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,482.664,484.647,"And that's the dilemma, it seems to me, here."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,487.193,488.13,Well--
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.13,488.833,I don't know what it is.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,488.833,498.111,"--The difference in that is that if it is an issue, an evidentiary issue or something, it would be adjudicated and revisited at the end of the trial, as all evidentiary issues."
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.022,526.208,Suppose there were some intervening decisions.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,544.795,556.087,"--They possibly could do that, Your Honor, but in... because the supreme court of Alabama has ruled on a motion to dismiss pleadings... this was not a summary judgment."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.113,590.809,"If you were to prevail on the State claim and then ultimately prevail here on your 1983 case, you wouldn't have to have a whole new trial."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,600.118,609.77,"I would think not, and the reason is because the State measure of damages in Alabama for wrongful death is the wrongfulness of the conduct of the defendant."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.844,623.141,but with respect to the liability and fault--
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,623.141,636.65,"Well, the issues that would be tried in the case in the... for the wrongful death, the issues and the evidence and even the measure of damages, what the jury is allowed to consider, would totally be different."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,636.65,641.96,"--Measure of damages would certainly be different, but I don't understand why the--"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,641.96,643.117,The conduct--
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,643.117,647.349,--The fault issues would necessarily be different.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,647.349,648.395,"--It may not, Your Honor."
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.391,663.764,"Mr. Pantazis, just for fun, why don't you tell us about the merits of the case."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,664.093,664.468,Okay.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,817.439,819.843,Why... you say it frustrates the purpose.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,826.715,835.759,"That's correct, it does satisfy the second element of deterrence, but it frustrates the first element of underlying policy of compensation."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.382,839.695,"Well, it doesn't satisfy it."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,841.6,844.755,"Well, it runs in conflict with it, Your Honor."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,862.481,864.856,"But we don't get to that, do we?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,864.856,866.058,We do--
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.058,869.98,"Well, we don't get to it because of the Federal rule, right?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,869.98,876.337,"--Well, if we have no 83 claim, as the supreme court of Alabama has said, it's all State."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.945,894.345,"No, but your argument, as I understand it, is that even to the extent of the deterrence there is a frustration of purpose here because the punitive damages cannot be recovered against the municipality."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,895.218,897.218,--That is... that is an argument.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,931.079,936.405,"Yes, but you never get to that limit because of the effect of the Federal law, do you?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,936.405,937.093,Well--
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,937.093,943.543,"Because whether there is a limit or whether there isn't a limit, you can't get any punitive damages against the municipality--"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,943.543,943.871,--Well--
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.871,947.088,"--under 1983, and that's a matter of Federal law, right?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,947.088,956.178,"--I disagree, and the reason I disagree is, the supreme court said there is no 83 claim, so we're not under any Federal law for this case, as it sits now at the trial level."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.178,968.204,"Well, but you don't claim an independent Federal basis for challenging the $100,000 limit on punitive damages for wrongful death in Alabama if it didn't involve a Federal claim, do you?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,968.204,968.876,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,968.876,971.0,"When you say exactly, do you mean yes or no?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,971.0,971.312,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.2,1022.901,Could I ask what you're seeking under the 1983 claim?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1039.503,1046.142,"--Your Honor, we're asking for the wrongful death statute to compensate the estate."
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1046.142,1066.399,"Well, under the 1983 action, as I read the complaint, it seemed to be asking for damages for Mrs. Jefferson's death and pain and suffering, as opposed to anything suffered by the children or the spouse."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1066.399,1088.141,"We are asking for the damages as listed in the Weeks case, which was a district court case in Alabama, which did say that the estate's damages are the measure of the pain and suffering, the funeral expenses of the decedent's heirs, or the descendents, and that is what we think the typical compensatory damage is that is encompassed in 49 States."
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1088.141,1094.717,"I'm sorry, you say you are not asking, then, for her pain and suffering."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1094.717,1095.496,No.
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1095.496,1098.104,Even though that's what... how the complaint reads.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1098.104,1130.778,"If the complaint reads that way, that may be an inartful pleading, but we're asking that the Court compensate the estate, and in compensating the estate, the Court look at traditional compensation measures for wrongful death, which, like we've indicated, 48 or 49 States... the only one I'm unsure of is Massachusetts... have held that when you compensate for death, the beneficiaries or the descendents are the ones whose... are the ones who suffer the loss and suffer the pain and also pay the medical bills and pay the funeral expenses."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1130.778,1159.814,"Mr. Pantazis, there's a distinction, I'm sure you are aware, between survival statutes and wrongful death acts, and one is thought as compensating the bereaved family members, and the other is thought as going to the estate, as the claims that the decedent would have if she had survived, her pain and suffering, and that goes to the estate."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1184.319,1190.161,"I believe, Your Honor, the damages go to the decedent's estate."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.673,1198.157,That's quite wrong.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1208.434,1209.215,"--Well, we are--"
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.215,1211.308,Why would you limit yourself to one rather than both?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1211.308,1225.974,"--Well, we are asking for both, but the way you compensate a decedent for death in reality, and what most of the States have done, is by compensating the heirs for what they have lost, or the descendents for what they have lost."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.974,1227.365,"Well, not in the normal survival action."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1240.89,1241.296,Well--
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.296,1245.358,And the money in the estate may never get to the family.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1251.402,1257.915,--Under the Alabama wrongful death statute it goes directly to the descendents and not attached by debts.
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.915,1258.929,That's the wrongful death recovery.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1258.929,1259.461,That's correct.
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.461,1260.881,But not survival recovery.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1270.285,1280.546,"The only... if you're speaking of a Federal remedy, that would be correct, but the only remedy we have in Alabama is the wrongful death, which would not allow that under Alabama common law, statutory law."
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.546,1287.98,"You say that under Alabama law, for a wrongful death, the proceeds have to go to the estate?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1287.98,1288.605,No.
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.842,1317.311,What a strange system.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1326.058,1327.464,It's the only remedy available.
1997.96-957,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.464,1337.991,"Well, I hope you have a sympathetic administrator of the estate, who likes the family, because it's no money in his pocket."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1337.991,1343.458,"That happens often, Your Honor, that the administrator is in conflict with the heirs."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.598,1386.347,Where would the Court be getting those rules from?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1416.038,1426.705,"We ask that the Court use the rationale that has been decided or looked at in the Weeks case, the district court case in Alabama, and if I may I'll quote that section."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1459.692,1462.378,Where would the district court get its law from?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1462.378,1471.187,"These type of damages are what most of the State statutes hold as compensatory damages in wrongful death, the typical--"
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.187,1474.108,So that you say is the source from which the district court obtained it?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1479.511,1484.448,"--The briefs in the district court case did have... I mean, there are several cases that they looked at."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1484.448,1488.009,Does the district court say where it got its law from?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1488.009,1491.867,The district court... I'm only familiar with this... the opinion does not.
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.757,1494.209,I'm not asking you to--
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1494.209,1494.459,--Right.
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.459,1495.865,--examine the judge's mind.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1497.583,1498.489,The opinion does not.
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.72,1511.655,--May I ask this question as a matter of Alabama law?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1530.007,1532.411,On the wrongful death?
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.771,1537.536,They have to... is there any provision under Alabama law for the estate to recover anything for that person?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1537.536,1543.143,"No, and it gets even worse than that, Your Honor, if I could explain."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.876,1548.109,"I knew Alabama had its idiosyncracies, but this is really surprising."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1548.109,1548.437,--The--
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.123,1554.342,No heirs in my case.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1554.342,1558.012,"Well, then there would be nobody getting... there would be somebody."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.012,1565.32,"I mean, she had left a will leaving everything to Alabama University, or something like that, but Alabama University would get nothing."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1565.32,1567.195,The will... the will wouldn't apply.
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.476,1571.552,But there are no heirs in my case.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1571.552,1573.177,Then there would be no recovery.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1573.63,1574.583,"Mr.... oh, I'm sorry."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1574.583,1581.33,--I was going to explain even further what problem we have in trying to implement a 1983 remedy here.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.859,1677.182,"Mr. Pantazis, going back to the Chief Justice's question about where the court in Weeks got its law, if I understand your answer, it got its law from sort of looking generally to the common law recovery rules beyond the State."
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1677.182,1677.822,That's correct.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1677.822,1692.691,"But it's not authorized to do that under 1988, is it, which refers to the common law of the State in which the court having jurisdiction is held, so how does... how did the Weeks court make this leap to the rest of the republic?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1692.691,1701.548,"I believe it does through Robertson, Your Honor, that it's the caveat of, where it states that it cannot be inconsistent with a policy--"
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1701.548,1714.042,"Well, I know that puts a block on what it can borrow from the State in which it sits, but it doesn't function as an affirmative authorization to travel to other States, does it?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1714.042,1715.51,--Well--
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.51,1716.728,Is it Federal common law?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1716.728,1722.18,"--It would be an establishment of some sort of Federal common law, similar to the--"
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.18,1722.539,So it's not borrowing at all.
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1726.724,1732.801,"--Well, where they are absent of those statutes, that's what 88 I think envisions."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1736.393,1740.436,Then why did we need the 1988 provision in the first place?
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1740.436,1743.326,"Well, you need the 1988 provision for the test."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.831,1781.78,"Do you wish to reserve the rest of your time, Mr. Pantazis?"
1997.96-957,0,21377,dennis_g_pantazis,,1781.78,1781.889,I do.
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.357,1782.795,Thank you.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1784.872,1790.886,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"

1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.087,1834.509,The--

1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.071,1838.476,--I think that's correct.

1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.584,1843.318,"--Well, the opposition--"
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.318,1845.442,--Is there any waiver principle or anything in--
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1845.442,1846.583,"--No, there is not."
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1879.772,1904.654,--Can he argue that he comes within your... the petitioner comes within the second exception because the Federal issue will necessarily survive on the grounds that the standard of care is different and less under the Federal cause of action that they want to apply?
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.654,1905.653,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.294,1909.9,"I mean, it seems to me that's the only way they could do it, to come within section 2."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.9,1923.567,"--Under the second exception it necessarily must be the case that the Federal cause of action would survive, and that's not the case here, because this pending State law claim involves the same parties, and the same underlying allegations."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.231,1992.446,There was a case some years ago... Justice Powell's decision in Pennsylvania v. Ritchie would seem to come pretty close to what is being sought here.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1992.446,2009.643,"My understanding of Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, and it's a very complicated case, but my understanding of it was that on the facts in that case the Federal claim could not survive regardless of the result on remand, which is why it was necessary to review it in the interlocutory posture."
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.995,2033.649,How do you understand the complaint with regard to the 1983 claim?
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.695,2039.131,"That's how I read it, Your Honor, because the complaint seeks--"
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.131,2040.006,--The deceased.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.006,2041.958,--relief for the injuries that the decedent suffered.
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.121,2071.46,And how do you understand Alabama law with regard to a survival action here under 1983?
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2071.46,2087.908,"Well, it would be under the wrongful death action, although again I think it's properly classified as a survival claim, and the... must be brought by the representative of the estate, and they're entitled to punitive damages to punish the wrongful death of the decedent."
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.462,2111.96,But Federal law says you can't recover that against a municipality.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2111.96,2112.445,That's right.
1997.96-957,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2124.065,2125.002,A real dilemma.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.002,2125.751,Yeah.
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.17,2141.557,"Mr. Roberts, may I just go back to the final judgment question for a minute to be sure I have it in mind."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2154.38,2156.692,"Well, that's the most likely one."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2166.875,2174.435,"Well, that would depend on what the finding is, and if it turns out that the... the defense, as I understand it, is we did nothing wrong."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.26,2187.243,"--I think that's right, yes."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.632,2198.286,"Right, but then your point... I want to be sure I have it fairly in mind."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2218.59,2219.714,"Oh, yes."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.245,2225.306,And you think that's enough to... that's enough not to come within any of the Cox exceptions.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2225.306,2225.822,--Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.326,2255.434,"Maybe Cox did cut way back on what the finality rule had been before, of course."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.028,2273.567,"It recognized what some have said a more pragmatic approach, but my point is that this is not within any of those exceptions, largely because the underlying claim that still remains alive, although a State law claim, is based on the same underlying allegations and it involves the same parties."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2307.617,2313.458,--But Robertson was a peculiar case in that there were no surviving members of the family.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2313.911,2314.707,--Well--
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2314.707,2324.5,"--idiosyncratic in that respect I thought, where here, there would be no case in which there could be a recovery."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2324.5,2329.544,--In Robertson there were no immediate relatives.
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.501,2373.339,"Mr. Roberts, I don't have the opinion in Robertson in front of me, but I vaguely remember something in the opinion that pointed out that this was a peculiar case because there were no surviving members of the family."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2373.339,2384.742,"--Justice Marshall's opinion did point out that this was peculiar in the sense that the decedent, Mr. Shaw, was not survived by parent, child, or sibling."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.981,2413.417,"Mr. Roberts, can I ask just a little more basic question?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2433.831,2437.799,"Well, it would depend under what guise."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.593,2442.812,Right.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2442.812,2446.591,"--in 1983 even against individuals, I would agree that would be inconsistent with Federal law."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.356,2451.276,"Well, I'm just asking broadly."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2471.065,2476.548,"--No, and I want to emphasize that that question, although it was adverted to earlier, is not before the Court today."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.344,2484.639,"Well, it's a question whether it's before the Court as to whether one views this as a damage issue or a question of standing."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2484.639,2495.009,"--Even if you view it as a damage issue, the validity of State caps on wrongful death recovery and whether they're overridden by 1983 is a difficult issue."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.553,2505.084,Correct.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2505.084,2511.986,"Congress, when it passed the one wrongful death provision it did pass in the Civil Rights Act in 1986 imposed a cap."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.876,2517.282,Okay.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.617,2537.929,I--
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.929,2542.114,"--just as it would in reverse, if a State granted it and... you couldn't say... anyway, go ahead."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2542.114,2559.342,"--I think it is, the same rule is applicable as a general matter, but not with respect to the wrongful death or survival question, because 1983 doesn't address that more narrow category, what are the appropriate... what is the appropriate relief, if any, in a wrongful death or survival case."
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.849,2595.844,"No, but Alabama has provided a remedy that's just some... but the damages it provided are unavailable, but the... if the Fact Concert had been decided the other way, the plaintiff would prevail."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.844,2601.231,I don't think you can sever the damages from the remedy under the Alabama regime.
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.215,2613.398,"Well, it's provided a wrongful death remedy for administrators of estates like this, but it does not allow damages."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2620.396,2635.219,"I'm not sure that the Court can sort of pick and choose which aspects of the Alabama remedy it wants to incorporate, saying we're going to incorporate the fact that you allow a wrongful death action, but we're not going to take the only way you allow it, which is for punitive damages."
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2635.219,2641.685,"Well, the line of reasoning Justice Stevens is exploring was the reasoning of the court in... the district court in Weeks, was it not?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2641.685,2643.48,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.308,2651.742,"As I read that... read that opinion, it says, well, there's a wrongful death action, and that other problem, and so we'll... and we'll keep that."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.739,2664.128,--That is the approach of the court.
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2664.128,2665.05,"That was the reasoning, anyway."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2665.05,2665.425,It is.
1997.96-957,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2665.425,2665.972,And you think that's wrong.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2665.972,2682.746,"We do think that's wrong, and we also think it's inapplicable even in this case, because the one thing the court did in Weeks is say, you get no recovery for injuries to the decedent, because we're going to give you wrongful death... we're going to measure compensation based on your loss as a survivor."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2696.803,2703.489,"Mr. Roberts, you said a second ago that you can't separate... shouldn't separate damages from remedy."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2722.449,2723.199,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2723.199,2727.448,You can't split the two in that respect.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2727.448,2729.01,I think that's right.
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2729.01,2734.336,"Conceptually you've got to say the only thing Alabama allows here is a punitive remedy, in effect, period."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2734.336,2743.737,"That's right, and, of course, it's not an approach that it's adopted in any way discriminatory to 1983 or this Court's decisions."
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2749.672,2753.061,Did you come across any historical... I'm just curious historically.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2785.236,2785.47,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2785.47,2786.158,The names get us mixed up.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.158,2786.548,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.548,2790.25,"But it's a survival statute for any tort, or certain tort claims."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2790.25,2790.625,Yes.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2790.625,2792.046,There probably were quite a few that hadn't.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2820.519,2831.983,"Not in the... there are references, of course, in the legislative history of 1983 to murders, lynchings, and of course Congress did provide remedies for those in the Civil Rights Act."
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.031,2868.124,"--But I wonder... it says the common law, too, doesn't it?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2868.124,2875.622,"--It says, if the laws of the United States are deficient, you look to the common law as modified."
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.622,2878.215,So maybe it meant that there was Federal common law at that time.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.104,2885.852,"Well, but it's the common law as modified by the statutes of the forum State, and my understanding is that if it's--"
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.852,2890.413,There would be no modification in a State that hadn't passed a survival action.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.413,2890.709,--That's right.
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.709,2894.004,So it wouldn't be an issue of the common law as modified.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2896.192,2897.363,In the--
1997.96-957,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.363,2900.315,"At which time they might have thought Federal common law, or is that... that's--"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.315,2911.607,"--Well, whether it was Federal common... whether it was Federal common law or State common law, it was unambiguous that in the absence of legislative change there was no recovery in the case of wrongful death."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.607,2914.762,"--Well, Swift v. Tyson didn't cover statutes, did it?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2926.257,2942.985,"No, not at all, and this Court recognized in the Brame case 6 years after 1983 was passed that at the common law... and it didn't differentiate between State or Federal, but at the common law they thought it was beyond question that there was no wrongful death or survival action."
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2942.985,2950.075,"And of course they did not assume that there could be a separate concept, did they, of Federal common law at that point?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2953.652,2955.667,I think--
1997.96-957,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2955.667,2962.149,"I asked your brother a question premised on exactly the opposite assumption, but I think I was wrong in doing that."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2962.149,2974.176,"--I think at the time the decisions recognized... they didn't break it down as Federal common law and State common law... that there were some issues that would be governed by the common law, more local issues--"
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.176,2975.129,"Mr. Roberts, it was neither State nor Federal."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2981.689,2987.749,"--And under 1988 it was applicable unless modified by the statutes... now, here, of course--"
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.749,3000.774,"You would agree, wouldn't you, Mr. Roberts, that if there was no survival statute or wrongful death statute in a State, a particular State in 1871, and they pass it in 1890, that would nevertheless control in cases after 1890?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3000.774,3004.32,"--Yes, because it incorporates... it doesn't stay frozen--"
1997.96-957,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.32,3004.82,Modified from time to time.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.82,3006.117,--At the time.
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3043.259,3068.591,"Mr. Roberts, isn't it... and this is a Federal claim, and it picks up on State law, auxiliary State law, that you could have a result on this... under this Federal claim for relief of no recovery at all in Alabama and a whopping recovery in the neighboring State, all under this Federal cause of action."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.464,3076.183,--Well--
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3076.183,3080.056,--and the Federal court would have to supplement it from some other source.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.056,3089.068,"--The fact that you get a different result from State to State, as this Court recognized in Robertson, is, of course, a necessary consequence of the terms of 1988."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3103.625,3126.679,"You could have minor variations, who are the survivors might be different in one State or another, some might have grandmothers and some might not, but this kind of basic variation of the question is, is it incompatible with the idea of a recovery to have this setup which says, you get... you end up getting nothing?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3126.679,3134.55,"Well, I think it begs the question to say that 1983 assumes there's going to be recovery in cases of survival and wrongful death."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.721,3144.281,Is there any other State in the union that has this situation where the only recovery under State law is punitive damages?
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3144.281,3147.67,--Massachusetts used to have that rule.
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3160.101,3175.393,"For an Alabama claim Alabama could do whatever it wants, have a cap on punitives and no cap on damages if one survives, which I understand is the law in Alabama."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3175.393,3188.466,"--But the only way to have a survival or wrongful death cause of action under 1983 is by incorporating the State law, because when 1983 was passed there was no survival or wrongful death at common law."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3210.206,3213.533,"Ah, but we've already crossed that bridge, haven't we, in this series of laws?"
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.103,3233.431,"--I believe so, yes."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3233.431,3235.993,"Right next to 1983, which says damages."
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3235.993,3249.863,"But here you're talking about an exception to the prevailing common law rule, and when you have a narrow exception in one section, I think the only logical inference is that Congress did not intend it in the other section."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3286.067,3289.113,And that would be if you take Alabama law wholesale.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3297.969,3304.607,"--Oh yes, and again, I don't think that issue is before the Court because the only... because that's not part of the wrongful death statute."
1997.96-957,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3305.482,3308.95,But on your reasoning I take it there would be no incompatibility there.
1997.96-957,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3308.95,3318.194,"--I think not, largely because at the time 1982 was passed many States... I'm not sure if there was quite a majority or not, but many had such caps."
1997.96-957,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.477,3357.929,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
