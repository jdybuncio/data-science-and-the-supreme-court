1970.88,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.845,"We’ll hear arguments in number 88, Ramsey and Nunley against United Mine Works."
1970.88,0,32512,john_a_rowntree,,47.689,51.49,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.278,392.336,"This is primarily because of the physical way the coal was embedded in that field in Tennessee that in order, in other words to make maximum and efficient utilization there’s no machinery you have to have thick and rather evenly stratified seams of coals, right?"
1970.88,0,32512,john_a_rowntree,,392.336,393.756,That’s correct and we say --
1970.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.756,399.0,And those Tennessee fields they are [Voice Overlap] even in thin.
1970.88,0,32512,john_a_rowntree,,399.0,405.747,"And we say that the reserves of the major companies are adoptable to this big new machinery, but such fields this southern Tennessee --"
1970.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.747,408.263,"It was not because they are major companies, is it or isn’t?"
1970.88,0,32512,john_a_rowntree,,408.263,410.92,It’s because they have great reserves of coal.
1970.88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.92,414.063,It’s because of I thought [Voice Overlap] of the nature of the coal field?
1970.88,0,32512,john_a_rowntree,,414.063,418.717,"Yes, well the reserves of the major companies."
1970.88,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.903,1638.223,Thank you Mr. Rowntree.
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1640.739,1645.868,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.876,1943.987,"Mr. Williams, as you read Pennington and as you read the clause, would the union have sacrifice its -- or forfeit its antitrust immunity, if that meeting of the clause is forever?"
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1943.987,1948.282,If that -- if what petitioners contend for Mr. Justice White were --
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.282,1949.313,Your contention?
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1949.313,1950.339,-- were correct.
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.339,1951.062,Yes.
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1951.062,1960.688,"If their meaning, if what they say paragraph “A” means is correct then under Pennington, the union would have lost its antitrust exemption."
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.688,1970.133,"But under your reading of the clause and under your reading of Pennington, I suppose you would argue that the union has not sacrifice its antitrust."
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1970.133,1979.682,"Exactly, under my reading of the clause and under the reading of the clause of all judges below, the union would not have sacrificed its antitrust exemption."
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.682,1990.686,"And, is that the same argument as saying well, it may have sacrificed its immunity but it has to violate the antitrust law?"
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1990.686,1994.297,"No sir, I'm saying Mr. Justice White --"
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.297,1999.045,"But even if it sacrifices immunity, you still have a job proving the unions violating the antitrust law."
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1999.045,2010.965,"Oh, yes, because the fact that it is no longer exempt under the antitrust law as I read Pennington does not make the act which rendered it non-exempt a per se violation."
1970.88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.965,2012.478,Assessment?
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2012.478,2013.985,Yes sir.
1970.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.079,2137.605,"Mr. Williams, you may continue, you were on Section 6 as we stopped for lunch."
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2137.605,2140.87,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1970.88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.122,2212.786,"You talked about that in your brief, I’ve forgotten."
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2214.138,2217.58,"1192, yes, I did Mr. Justice Stewart."
1970.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.032,2342.526,"What page are you on, on this?"
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2342.696,2348.027,"I’m now at page 10 of the petitioner’s reply to the brief of respondent, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.027,2350.526,Thank you.
1970.88,1,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2350.526,2395.501,"They say that he changed his views and they say that, if the Court please, with no record reference and indeed no record support or if they were right with respect to the contention that the trial-judge had undergone a change of mind with respect to what the true burden of proof was, I suggest to the Court that this case neither would have been nor shouldn’t have been here because the remedy was easily available to the petitioners to ask for a remand from the Sixth Circuit of this case back to the trial court for purposes of filing a motion under Rule 60 (b) to correct the judgment upon error of law."
1970.88,2,32512,john_a_rowntree,,3309.029,3316.023,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.88,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3383.489,3388.807,Suppose everybody doesn’t -- no one needs or has to belong with the employer or union?
1970.88,2,32512,john_a_rowntree,,3388.807,3389.992,"No, sir."
1970.88,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3389.992,3398.012,What if he doesn’t want to sign up the agreement that’s negotiated for the unit -- doesn’t need to be a member of the unit?
1970.88,2,32512,john_a_rowntree,,3398.012,3402.554,That’s correct Your Honor and you could belong to BCOA or not.
1970.88,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3416.563,3423.901,How many cases have been tried in which the union has been sued for damages on a course of action like this?
1970.88,2,32512,john_a_rowntree,,3423.901,3425.649,"Alright, I think it’s about five cases."
