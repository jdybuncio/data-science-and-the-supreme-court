1996.96-6133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.772,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-6133, William Bracy v. Richard B. Gramley."
1996.96-6133,0,25645,gilbert_h_levy,,50.663,53.182,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-6133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,80.499,90.474,"Well, would your case be any weaker if he had never accepted... never given bribes when he was an attorney and simply had accepted them when he was a judge?"
1996.96-6133,0,25645,gilbert_h_levy,,90.474,92.824,"It would not be any weaker, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-6133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.824,95.176,Then why do you mention the attorney business?
1996.96-6133,0,25645,gilbert_h_levy,,95.176,116.422,"It seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice, that it's relative to the character of the person who is assumed to regard his oath and office and be fair in my client's case, a factor, I think, that the district court would want to take into consideration in determining whether or not there was a due process violation."
1996.96-6133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.422,116.622,Well--
1996.96-6133,0,25645,gilbert_h_levy,,134.134,141.407,"I think the standard, Mr. Chief Justice, as this Court indicated in Murchison, is probability of unfairness in this case."
1996.96-6133,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.166,177.294,"Well, when you say probability of unfairness, you're saying that if you can show in some other cases that he asked for a bribe, or that perhaps he suggested if you didn't give him a bribe he would be very tough on you, that would be enough, without showing anything in this particular case?"
1996.96-6133,0,25645,gilbert_h_levy,,180.412,183.364,"No, Your Honor, if I may explain, please."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1622.012,1631.518,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.514,1656.85,"May I ask kind of a basic question, Ms. Preiner?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1672.944,1675.313,"--I believe it would be, Your Honor."
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.633,1684.169,And so the question is whether he had a judge here?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1684.169,1690.239,"--Whether he had... yes, a duly elected judge, and he was tried by the judge and a jury."
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.239,1694.541,"Do you think it's better to be tried by a corrupt judge then by an accountant, for example?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1694.541,1697.493,"I suppose it depends on the accountant, but--"
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.262,1700.029,"No, but under your answer--"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1700.029,1700.029,But we would assume--
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.029,1704.331,"--all accountants, we'd set it aside, even the most brilliant, fair-minded, honest--"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1704.331,1726.16,"--Well, I... certainly no slur meant on accountants, or judges, but yes, we would assume that since the people have elected a certain person to sit in judgment on his fellows, that it would be his obligation, and we haven't done that for any accountants, so they would not be within that category that we trust with these decisions."
1996.96-6133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.16,1731.564,"--Well, I suppose you haven't had a trial, in the ordinary sense, if it's been done before a kangaroo court."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1738.654,1739.204,Yes.
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.204,1743.122,"And of course, that's the issue here."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1745.391,1753.58,"Well, I believe... yes, and I think that he has had a trial here, and he hasn't shown that the judge was corrupt in his case."
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.756,1769.923,But there's more in this record.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1783.214,1786.449,--I believe that that's reading that evidence too broadly.
1996.96-6133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.194,1807.062,Hadn't a bribe been invited or solicited in that case?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1808.412,1813.797,"--I don't know... I don't know that a bribe had been solicited in particularly that case, but clearly this lawyer--"
1996.96-6133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.797,1816.463,But this lawyer had previously come up with bribes.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1816.463,1824.153,"--He had a history of engaging in that business practice with this judge, and furthermore, we only have this lawyer's word for it, that it would have been an acquittal."
1996.96-6133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.153,1826.355,Was it a bench trial or a jury trial?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1826.355,1827.171,That was a bench trial.
1996.96-6133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.979,1847.816,"Well, I think you, like the petitioner, need to be careful about what we're being asked to do here."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1854.839,1854.839,--That--
1996.96-6133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.839,1863.695,There was good cause for discovery to take depositions of the judge and the attorney that was appointed.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1863.695,1867.813,"--And that is my understanding of the issue that the Court framed, and that is certainly the issue that we briefed, but--"
1996.96-6133,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.813,1876.836,"So what we have to decide is what would amount to good cause, and what would be an abuse of discretion for denying discovery."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1876.836,1878.538,"--Clearly, I agree with that, Your Honor."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.63,1913.026,What should be our ruling on the substantive basis for relief in a case where it is shown that the judge did have the modus operandi of being very tough in those cases where there was no bribe in order to facilitate taking bribes in the other cases?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1921.632,1938.993,"--I believe that if he could show that there was a modus operandi whereby the judge was ruling more harshly against defendants in order to cover his bribe-taking, or in order to balance his win-loss statistics, then I believe that he would be able to show actual bias in his case."
1996.96-6133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.945,1942.895,But he wants discovery for that very purpose.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1942.895,1952.669,"But Your Honor, in order to even bring the habeas petition to the Court and ask for discovery, he has to show that there is at least some basis for his claim."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.669,1954.186,"Well, he has Swano's testimony."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1954.186,1957.971,"He... actually, he doesn't have Swano's testimony."
1996.96-6133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1964.358,1970.762,You're not claiming that the... or maybe you are claiming that the writ is subject to dismissal right now?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1970.762,1973.048,--I believe that if what--
1996.96-6133,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1973.048,1975.381,That the petition for writ is subject to dismissal right now.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1976.233,1980.368,--I believe that it was properly... it was subject to dismissal by the court below.
1996.96-6133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1980.368,1982.654,Maloney was on trial.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,1998.663,2001.115,I believe that the transcript was unavailable.
1996.96-6133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2003.531,2010.887,"Well, the transcript was what he needed to say, look at this testimony that we have from Swano in this record."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2019.41,2022.778,--I think that that is certainly something that he could have argued.
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2058.952,2110.669,"Well, what about the argument which has at least been brooded about here this morning that if a trial in which there was no known bribery is sandwiched between trials in which there was bribery, or was conducted at a time when bribes were being solicited and arranged in other cases, there is good reason to believe, certainly in the elected system that Justice Stevens alluded to, that it would be in a judge's interest to look tough in a case in which he could be tough at no cost to himself without losing a bribe, and that that would be a reasonable basis for saying that discovery may uncover evidence that would substantiate the claim here."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2123.477,2127.012,"With all due respect, Your Honor, that's nothing more than speculation."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2127.946,2129.248,"Well, it's not speculation."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2169.539,2174.443,--Because I believe that what we have here then is just a range of speculation.
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.649,2191.636,So you're saying that neither Justice Scalia's view nor the view that I've been suggesting is even reasonable.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2197.873,2199.057,I believe they're all reasonable.
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2199.74,2202.842,"Well, if they're reasonable, then we're beyond the point of mere speculation."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2209.746,2214.198,I suppose speculation would be among a range of probabilities.
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.833,2220.554,"Of course, this isn't like a lot of requests for discovery where it's totally a fishing expedition."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2237.079,2239.931,"--Actually, with all due respect, Your Honor, I disagree."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.252,2253.441,"Well, what about the allegation that the trial was set to precede the trial where the bribe was taking place?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2253.441,2255.857,"Frankly, Judge, this is the first time I've heard that claim made."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.857,2257.309,That's the first time you've heard that?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2262.297,2263.08,He never has.
1996.96-6133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.647,2267.599,"Has he... was he tried, or did he... he didn't plead guilty?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2267.599,2268.382,He did not plead guilty.
1996.96-6133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.382,2269.382,And he has been convicted?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2269.382,2270.099,He has been.
1996.96-6133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.099,2272.467,So it wouldn't do any good to ask him any of these questions.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2282.739,2294.297,"I believe that the record will reflect on what date this trial occurred, and beyond that I don't think anyone has ever suggested that there was a specific reason for timing with respect to the trial date here."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2294.297,2309.89,"--If this case, if Bracy's trial was set before the other trial, would... for that purpose, would that automatically show bias that would entitle the petitioner to relief here?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2309.89,2312.473,I don't believe that that would be sufficient to show that there was bias in this case.
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2312.473,2312.889,You do believe that it would?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2312.889,2313.706,I do not.
1996.96-6133,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2313.706,2329.649,"If you were to go as far as... your opposing counsel says that an attorney was appointed for this person who would agree to a triple capital trial within a month, when in fact he should have wanted a much longer time to prepare."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2341.373,2358.935,"I don't believe that he has... I don't believe that there's ever been any suggestion that this attorney was engaged in that... that he didn't properly prepare for this case, or that he agreed to some short time period for the setting of this trial."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.935,2366.605,"Yes, but that would be a ruling in this case that was made on grounds of bias and prejudice and for corruption."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2368.355,2368.988,No.
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.94,2380.594,But let's assume that the trial is set in order to advance a conspiracy to take bribes.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2380.594,2384.962,"--Then, absolutely that would be evidence of bias in this case."
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.212,2386.445,And that would be grounds for--
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2386.445,2387.295,--that there's a conspiracy.
1996.96-6133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.295,2388.747,"--upsetting the conviction, would it not?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2388.747,2389.697,I believe that would be.
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.742,2418.93,"Yes, but you're not going to argue that we apply harmless error... if there's proof of this guy was corrupt in this very case and made some rulings because he was bribed, you wouldn't say that there's harmless error there."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2418.93,2419.263,"--I would never say that, Your Honor."
1996.96-6133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.263,2419.713,No.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2431.404,2432.054,They did.
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.398,2486.538,"Counsel, before you finish, would you comment at all on whether you think there's any significance to the amicus brief filed by not only some distinguished Illinois lawyers, but former prosecutors and former U.S. attorneys, suggesting discovery is appropriate in this case?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2486.538,2502.0,"I sympathize, and certainly the Attorney General sympathizes also with those lawyers and their perception that there is a taint on the judicial system in Illinois because of the scandal, of the Greylord scandal."
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.039,2518.609,"No, but just to bring back the point Justice O'Connor raised, we're really not... we don't really have to decide that."
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2534.952,2536.135,--Well--
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.135,2538.57,Because the problem goes beyond this one case.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2538.57,2542.122,--I'm not entirely sure that anything will be learned by discovery in this case.
1996.96-6133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2558.615,2564.317,"What would be enough, in your view?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2569.554,2580.862,"For example, Your Honor, if he could say, I did an inventory of all the trial court's rulings in this case, and out of 187 rulings that he made, 180 of them went in favor of the State, and here's why they were wrong."
1996.96-6133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.66,2617.717,"Ms. Preiner, I'm... the brief that was referred to signed by former prosecutors, these people are former prosecutors?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2617.717,2619.117,"Former prosecutors, yes."
1996.96-6133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.117,2620.486,They practice criminal law now?
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2620.486,2622.219,"Some of them do, yes."
1996.96-6133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.219,2623.521,Usually on behalf of defendants.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2623.521,2626.639,Almost exclusively on behalf of defendants.
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.881,2648.887,"Going back to the amicus brief, it does include a fair number of lawyers who do not practice on behalf of criminal defendants, such as former Governor Thompson--"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2649.287,2649.287,It includes--
1996.96-6133,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.287,2653.739,"Former Justice Seymour Simon... there are quite a few in there who are not representing defendants now, is that not right?"
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2653.739,2656.941,--And many law school professors and people from all--
1996.96-6133,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2656.941,2659.024,So it's not almost exclusively.
1996.96-6133,1,17950,barbara_a_preiner,,2660.79,2668.046,"--Well, the lawyers who are criminal defense lawyers on there are lawyers who represent criminal defendants."
1996.96-6133,2,25645,gilbert_h_levy,,2714.341,2717.96,"This is a... it's a permutation on a previous argument, Justice Kennedy."
