1999.99-5739,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.982,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 99-5739, Dewey Jones v. the United States."
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,9.934,26.957,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,131.604,134.602,"Mr. Falk, are you conceding in your argument that the statute does apply?"
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,136.93,140.616,"No, we do not concede that the statute applies."
1999.99-5739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,165.964,173.822,"Do you think if... if we did not have the constitutional concerns in the background, do you think the statutory language is clearly with you or against you?"
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,173.822,178.837,We believe the statutory language is with us even without the constitutional considerations in the background.
1999.99-5739,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.383,220.694,Would it torture the words of the statute to say that the home was used to obtain a mortgage?
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,220.694,228.863,"Well, I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that it tortures the words of the statute, Justice Kennedy, but it certainly twists them a bit."
1999.99-5739,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.759,256.476,I... I acknowledge that in the ordinary sense you use the mortgage to get the house.
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,265.752,285.089,"--Well, we believe that... that in the normal diction, in the normal, ordinary understanding of those words, when they're read entirely in context, property used in an activity affecting interstate commerce, that is required, and we think that's reinforced by the... by the... the sense that the Congress that passed this statute apparently had."
1999.99-5739,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.508,290.601,How do you distinguish... excuse me.
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,293.85,314.827,"--Well, we think this case is... is quite clearly distinct from the Russell case because in that case, the landlord was using the property... was bartering the occupancy of the property for a generation of income, very much like... like what was going on in... in the Smith case where you were trading something to get income, allowing people to come in and occupy the property."
1999.99-5739,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.825,330.65,"Well, what if the house is used... the property is put up to get a mortgage to get money to go into an interstate trucking business?"
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,331.963,333.023,Even so--
1999.99-5739,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.023,333.867,The homeowner does.
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,339.225,358.952,"--We do not believe so, Justice O'Connor, because the... subjecting the house to a security interest is not the kind of activity affecting interstate commerce, the continuous sort of activity affecting interstate commerce, that this Court and... and Congress in its other statutes has... has repeatedly taken those words to mean."
1999.99-5739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,385.363,394.126,"So, with respect to the mortgage, are you conceding that it is used but simply saying that use is irrelevant because it's not used in an activity?"
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,395.5,404.48,"Well, we are conceding that... that it is not torturing the language, in Justice Kennedy's words, to say that it is used in some sense."
1999.99-5739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.605,417.209,"Well, in... in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, do you concede that it is used within the meaning of the statute, but that the use is not a use in an activity within the meaning of the statute?"
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,420.271,420.599,--No.
1999.99-5739,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.306,463.004,--have to admit it's a very peculiar statute if it... it reaches someone who sets fire to a private residence that is owned by the occupant... I'm sorry.
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,489.664,491.571,I agree it... it is not--
1999.99-5739,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.571,497.989,"You can imagine the two criminals saying, gee, is this... is this building leased or... or is it owned by the occupant?"
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,499.036,500.957,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
1999.99-5739,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.957,503.442,"--If it's owned by the occupant, we don't have to worry."
1999.99-5739,0,20864,donald_m_falk,,504.409,518.982,"--Well, Justice Scalia, when you get back to the attempt to draw some nexus between this very basic State common law crime in interstate commerce, when a building is being rented out, it is being used in what is recognized as a commercial activity."
1999.99-5739,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1656.736,1661.11,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5739,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.806,1695.3,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, I wouldn't... I have read Russell to... I... I grant you it says that, but I... I wouldn't have read Russell to say that it meant to push the word used in the statute to the limit of the word use."
1999.99-5739,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1695.3,1702.999,I don't think that the... the Court addressed the construction of use the way that it's been discussed in this case.
1999.99-5739,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1729.488,1737.096,"But doesn't the... doesn't your argument, in effect, entail the conclusion that the jurisdictional element will always be satisfied?"
1999.99-5739,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1750.482,1760.804,"Well, I do think that the jurisdictional element acts as a... a limitation, Justice Souter, although it may not act as a limitation that is narrower than the constitutional power of Congress."
1999.99-5739,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.334,1771.145,Can you give us a hypothetical where... where that wouldn't exist?
1999.99-5739,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1778.845,1788.857,"Well, I think that if the... that if the Federal Government made shoplifting from businesses that do business in interstate commerce a Federal crime, it could do so."
1999.99-5739,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.857,1793.683,"Oh, what about... what about theft from a private home?"
1999.99-5739,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1802.18,1828.622,"Well, I think theft from a private home is a more difficult case than this case because in this case the crime of arson is extremely likely to destroy the property itself, and where, as here, the Government is able to show that there is an out-of-state mortgage company, an out-of-state insurance company, and out-of-state supplies of natural gas that are going to the home, the destruction of the home will create a potential--"
1999.99-5739,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.622,1833.042,"So, theft from a home you're willing to concede could not be made a Federal crime."
1999.99-5739,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1833.042,1834.776,"--No, I wouldn't be willing to concede."
1999.99-5739,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.776,1836.682,"Well, give me something you are willing to concede."
1999.99-5739,2,20864,donald_m_falk,,3388.097,3401.139,There are deep and significant concerns about our Federal system that are posed by this case.
1999.99-5739,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3558.314,3562.314,"Thank you, Mr. Falk. The case is submitted."
