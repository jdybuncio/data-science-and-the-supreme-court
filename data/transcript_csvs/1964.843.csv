1964.843,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.343,"Number 843, Paul V. Case, Petitioner, versus Nebraska."
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,32.746,36.632,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,264.838,271.701,Are there any suggesting that there might be some other state post-conviction remedy to which the matter devoted?
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,271.701,276.275,"No sir, the opinion is completely silent about any other possible remedy at all."
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,278.859,284.837,"Well, I suppose we should consider this on the premise of -- that is the only state post-conviction?"
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,284.837,299.916,"No sir, we need not to consider it now because the new statute which has just been enacted in Nebraska, which does appear to provide a post-conviction procedure which I would like to discuss in just a moment in somewhat greater length."
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,299.916,301.674,Before getting at it.
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,305.501,322.497,"No sir, the law -- and it's perfectly clear and in fact the State conceded in its response filed through the certiorari petition in this Court, that there was no other remedy under Nebraska law, and certainly the Nebraska law will quite clearly reveal that."
1964.843,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.871,418.71,Your whole case is that the State is required to give post-conviction remedy.
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,418.71,418.837,Yes sir.
1964.843,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.837,420.855,And Nebraska has now done so.
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,420.855,421.025,No sir.
1964.843,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,421.025,422.049,So is that the end of your case?
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,422.049,423.975,"No sir, that's where I would disagree strongly."
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.988,443.591,(Inaudible)
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,443.591,444.108,Yes sir.
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,444.108,445.883,(Inaudible)
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,445.883,446.53,No sir.
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.53,447.148,No?
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,447.148,449.493,I would hold to the same mandate precisely.
1964.843,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.526,457.378,But I would just say -- do I state accurately the mandate that you did seek?
1964.843,0,21248,daniel_j_meador,,457.378,464.078,"Yes, the mandate I seek is a remand of the case with direction to the petition of the accord of the hearing."
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1504.663,1508.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.375,1569.721,What?
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1569.721,1574.044,We do believe that this does provide a remedy.
1964.843,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.693,1601.207,Well can the Attorney General make the representation that no opposition on that score would be interposed with the petitioner under the new statute by this person?
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1601.207,1601.862,"No, Your Honor."
1964.843,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.862,1602.993,You cannot make it.
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1602.993,1608.556,Because this will be handled back in the lower court -- trial court by the county attorney who --
1964.843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.556,1620.21,"Do you object, you're at this level, put to a remand on this case, the vacating of the judgment in the remand for the Supreme Court of Nebraska to be considered the case in the light of the new statute?"
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1621.398,1623.094,"No, Your Honor."
1964.843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.083,1658.349,I would think the only reason that you might give this remedy or do a remand would be at some court decided -- that the Court decided that he has to file a new petition.
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1671.665,1672.804,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.804,1676.043,You think you could get a hearing on the allegations you made?
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1676.043,1678.193,"Yes, I do."
1964.843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.193,1679.255,"Well, you don't even got counsel."
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1679.255,1709.849,"The only objection I have is attaching any statement on this remand that for future, if we want to talk about the future, for any kind of authority to say that we're going to bring a man back up here and discharge him without any evidentiary hearing at all if the State fail because you're not, it's not the state court that's then being punished, it's the public that's being punished because we have to assume that there's an interest in law enforcement and bringing these people to justice, as well as protecting their rights."
1964.843,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1715.768,1726.069,(Inaudible)
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1726.069,1728.576,"No, Mr. Justice Goldberg I did not."
1964.843,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1751.018,1766.377,(Inaudible)
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1766.377,1767.683,Yes.
1964.843,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1767.683,1771.078,(Inaudible)
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1771.078,1772.208,To eliminate his â€“-
1964.843,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1772.208,1789.371,(Inaudible)
1964.843,1,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1789.371,1793.966,"Yes, we have no objection to that, Your Honor."
1964.843,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.966,1801.334,"Mr. Meador, I don't know why I started to call -- I'm sorry, I'm just wondering if it would."
1964.843,2,21248,daniel_j_meador,,1801.334,1805.218,That sounds to me to be the mandate for that one.
1964.843,3,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,1805.218,1819.635,"One of the -- Mr. Meador's -- one his main contention in his brief has been because of the congestion in the federal district courts that we shouldn't continue saying well, if he's exhausted the state remedy, he can go to the federal district court."
1964.843,4,21248,daniel_j_meador,,1927.303,1928.413,May it please the Court.
