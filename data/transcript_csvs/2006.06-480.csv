2006.06-480,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.587,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,10.639,13.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.989,115.979,"There was an argument made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,115.979,124.624,"Well, the economists who have looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case."
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,151.022,158.078,"Mr. Olson, suppose just the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,159.167,159.548,--No.
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,163.6,164.552,Would you say that it's per se unlawful?
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,164.552,179.822,"I think it would be, as horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was... if it was... involved the manufacturer in some way, it could be dealt with by the rule of reason."
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,179.822,191.238,Why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions?
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,191.529,201.036,"What this Court said in Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan, is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive to increase--"
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,201.036,203.367,"--No, but I'm asking what if he did, why should you draw a distinction?"
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,203.367,215.986,"--Because the motivation for the arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer... you're suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in a particular area would get together to impose this on a manufacturer."
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.209,219.409,No.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,228.394,251.169,"I think that if the manufacturer makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of course relationships between the dealers and the manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in doing this, because they may find for the same reason that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of products."
2006.06-480,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.239,274.276,"Maybe, Mr. Olson, you could give us an example where the rule of reason would find a violation in this situation?"
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,274.276,296.058,"Well, it might be a situation, the economists have written about this, say that it would be very rare, and would require retailers with a strong powerful market power to impose a situation where the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a horizontal cartel."
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,313.362,315.323,You say very.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,354.907,355.398,Well--
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.398,366.796,"What that sounds like is that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,373.31,373.56,--Well--
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,373.56,376.121,Should we overturn Dr. Miles and run that risk?
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,376.121,382.035,"--In, in the vast majority of the economist whose have looked at this have come out to the opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer."
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,382.887,384.73,We're supposed to count economists?
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,384.73,385.021,--No.
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,385.601,386.109,Is that how we decide it?
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,386.52,396.718,"--But what this Court... what this Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such as this where there's a consensus among leading respected economists, that is one factor."
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.87,398.008,"Well, I haven't seen a consensus."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,403.89,427.166,"--This is one factor that the Court should consider and the Court has considered in the past when dealing with something that the Court itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with respect to other vertical restraints."
2006.06-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.979,453.773,But it was not so long ago that the Department of Justice took a different view.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,487.877,493.109,"Essentially, the same argument was made in the Sylvania... at the time of the Sylvania case."
2006.06-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.905,520.087,But in those cases you didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and McGuire.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,526.141,532.727,"--The repeal of those statutes, Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules."
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.697,538.891,"No, but there was in the patent case, though, Mr. Olson."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,541.673,542.374,"--Yes, you did."
2006.06-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.374,542.721,Yes.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,542.721,546.705,"And that was a, that was one factor, however, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-480,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,584.2,586.952,"What about... what about the reliance interest, though?"
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,599.779,609.926,"--There's really no evidence that the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice--"
2006.06-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,609.926,619.123,"Isn't there evidence that the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade?"
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,622.964,625.277,"--Actually I looked into that, Justice Souter."
2006.06-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,649.875,650.346,"Well, I don't know."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,719.731,722.552,"Well, a number of things have changed."
2006.06-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.399,786.172,"Mr. Olson, does brand competition generally help retailers, or is this a question that can't be answered?"
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,786.172,787.554,--Did you say inter--
2006.06-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.554,789.156,"Interbrand, interbrand competition?"
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,790.796,796.212,"--Well, I don't know that... I don't know whether people like competition."
2006.06-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,803.608,805.699,"Well, but we're talking about inter... we're talking about retailers."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,834.627,850.579,"--Well, the manufacturer is very unlikely to do this for the convenience of the retailers, to... because it's in the interest of the manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the manufacturers' products as possible."
2006.06-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.579,856.854,"If... if, if indeed that's, that's what he's aiming at, low price."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,862.968,864.206,No.
2006.06-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.206,865.638,I thought it was consumer welfare.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,865.638,866.709,"Yes, yes, it is."
2006.06-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.709,873.683,And I thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,873.683,875.135,Precisely.
2006.06-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.135,879.367,So the mere fact that it would increase prices doesn't prove anything.
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,896.81,898.102,That's... that's absolutely correct.
2006.06-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.102,905.866,"So I don't know why, why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether it's going to... going to produce higher prices or not."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,913.923,915.944,I... I agree completely.
2006.06-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,954.369,975.643,"Mr. Olson, before you sit down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount; not this plaintiff, but others were allowed to discount."
2006.06-480,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,983.728,986.42,This... but the case was never litigated on that basis.
2006.06-480,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1000.511,1001.683,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2006.06-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1001.683,1002.064,"--in the complaint,."
2006.06-480,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1002.064,1004.434,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1006.235,1017.324,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1033.303,1036.715,"Maybe I'll put my question, which is really just one for this."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1102.65,1103.601,"--Several reasons, Your Honor."
2006.06-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.781,1119.483,I would think it is quite a close question.
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1119.483,1120.532,"--I don't think you, Your Honor."
2006.06-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.843,1121.043,"All right, even so."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1121.774,1136.233,"--Given that this Court's test, the question this Court's modern cases ask, in distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se rule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or almost always anticompetitive."
2006.06-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1137.585,1142.918,"Price fixing, horizontal, I guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1142.918,1144.127,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
2006.06-480,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.433,1245.507,Wouldn't your argument also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in this product just to fix prices?
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1256.452,1264.798,"--No, Your Honor, because horizontal... the important thing to keep in mind is that the incentive of the manufacturer when the manufacturer--"
2006.06-480,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.798,1279.748,I'm talking about a case in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide extra services at higher prices as their method of better serving the public and they all agree that they have to be conscious about the competition from other brands.
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1285.0,1295.919,"--Your Honor, the reason why we know that is always or almost always harmful is that the incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel, just like the incentives of the participants in a manufacturing cartel--"
2006.06-480,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.919,1303.305,"They might be precisely the same as the manufacturers: We think we'll make more, all make more money if we concentrate on service rather than price."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1303.305,1312.552,"--No, Your Honor, because the manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits of the retailers, but the retailers when they get together obviously have a very different incentive, which is not to benefit the manufacturer."
2006.06-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.552,1312.822,What you say is right.
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1347.296,1348.275,Your Honor--
2006.06-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.275,1348.856,That's what it was.
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1350.609,1353.911,"--Your Honor, in State Oil the same argument was made."
2006.06-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1373.963,1398.048,"We do have empirical evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this case is going to be very significant in the sort of battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to Congress, which is in a position to know more about where the shot is going to land than we are?"
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1398.048,1398.797,--This Court... I'm sorry.
2006.06-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1405.432,1407.015,That's my point.
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1424.176,1425.616,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.06-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1431.49,1438.274,"They began, but they have flourished in the post-fair trade era."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1438.274,1451.622,"Yes, Your Honor, but I think considerations likes the opening up of international trade and the development of markets like China to supply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the success of the Wal-Marts of the world than a rule like Dr. Miles."
2006.06-480,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1468.334,1474.068,"Well then, what's the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's perfectly legal to achieve the same result already?"
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1474.068,1500.355,"As the Ping amicus brief, the Ping Golf Club Manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the Colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy like Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without further discussion for discounting one item in order to keep your policy in place."
2006.06-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.355,1508.891,"But doesn't that answer your argument that there isn't reason to believe that there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes, because now it's going to be easy?"
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1508.891,1518.948,"Your Honor, in 1945 during the height of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was affected by fair trade."
2006.06-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1551.9,1565.577,Isn't it fair to say that there is reason to believe that there may be a massive reorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes?
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1576.474,1581.73,"I'm not aware of any reason to believe that, Your Honor, based on the historical record and based on the modern realities."
2006.06-480,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1594.557,1608.916,"If the rule of reason is the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be... this case would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never get to trial."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1619.943,1638.414,"--Your Honor, I think it would operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would be required to establish an anticompetitive effect resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that burden is overcome the defendant would be required to come up with some legitimate business justification, some pro-competitive results that outweigh that."
2006.06-480,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1640.555,1651.574,"Well, that's the formula, but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that the plaintiff could never get across the first threshold?"
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1651.574,1653.084,"We don't agree with that, Your Honor."
2006.06-480,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1664.592,1666.845,"But in this case, this case has none of those features."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1666.845,1667.834,"Well, right."
2006.06-480,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1667.834,1670.118,"Leegin loses under the rule of reason, right?"
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1670.118,1671.226,We don't know that.
2006.06-480,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.986,1684.937,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2006.06-480,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1684.937,1685.398,Thank you.
2006.06-480,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1685.398,1690.561,Mr. Coykendall.
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1690.561,1707.01,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As recently as last month, this Court restated a guiding principle of antitrust jurisprudence: Discouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low prices is bad antitrust policy."
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.453,1710.443,Is that right?
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1719.539,1722.451,"--Well, we aren't talking about any arrangement--"
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.451,1727.633,"I mean, a lot of consumers want, you know, extended warranties."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1769.985,1771.364,--I don't discount all those things.
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.699,1779.52,"Well, they aren't available."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1791.377,1796.12,And there's no question that even the plaintiff in this case was providing that service.
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.142,1803.106,"I don't, I don't know that there's no question about that."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1816.133,1824.988,"The record shows that with this specific company, most of the growth of its sales occurred before it established a resale price maintenance policy."
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1831.543,1837.498,"What is your main objection to... I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of reason."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1843.991,1855.718,"Well, as a practical matter for someone in my position, or plaintiff's position, it's impossible for a small dealer to muster the resources in order to put forth--"
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.718,1856.54,For a small dealer.
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1867.269,1874.433,--I would suggest that those are not the people that really are being protected by this particular per se prohibition.
2006.06-480,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1888.202,1908.075,So you don't agree with the argument that we've heard this morning that the transformation of American retailing since the 1970s and the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and that overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1908.075,1910.188,"No, I absolutely agree with that."
2006.06-480,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1928.227,1937.834,Is there anything to suggest that the large-scale low-price retailers who were supposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are... support its retention?
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,1945.279,1950.964,"--Again, the large-scale dominant players in the retail industry have their own market power."
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.68,1961.77,I don't understand that.
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2018.007,2031.786,"Well, again I would suggest that under this current system the way it is we have both the full service providers of complete service that offer goods at a certain price and we have discounters selling those same goods."
2006.06-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2047.276,2050.538,"Well, I thought the per se rule was the cookie cutter approach."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2050.538,2059.033,"Well, in terms of prohibiting price or in terms of, yes, prohibiting price fixing, that's true."
2006.06-480,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.815,2095.257,"The Internet... is it... you would have said fourty years ago, or I think we are in this argument, you would have said that it's the large discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2123.407,2129.772,"Well, there is no doubt that resale price maintenance raises prices to consumers."
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2138.016,2163.113,"Well, I thought the Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made, the prices may be... resale price... the current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important, and they have to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2163.113,2173.14,"Well, Your Honor, I would suggest that, first of all, eliminating the per se rule would not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate doctrine."
2006.06-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.835,2199.968,"Even with the tremendous anomaly that the employer... that the... the manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that won't go along?"
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2218.912,2226.856,"--I believe that anomaly really lies at the heart of the Sherman Antitrust Act which is aimed at contracts, combinations and conspiracies."
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.626,2257.377,Why is that?
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2272.146,2282.023,"Well, again, then they would be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the uncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this contract is lawful."
2006.06-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.323,2335.519,"Yeah, but the conspiracy that it facilitated was just with intrabrand competition."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2339.41,2340.041,Retail--
2006.06-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.041,2348.896,"So I'm not sure that economically it makes any difference whether the dealers are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was, or they all did it at the same time."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2348.896,2356.44,"--Horizontal conspiracies, even among a single brand, has always been a per se violation of the antitrust law."
2006.06-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.461,2372.672,"No, but if we say the rule or reason should apply to all cases that just affect intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that only affect intrabrand competition."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2372.672,2388.833,"--There you're striking really at the heart of the... the heart of the Sherman Act, et al., holding that horizontal conspiracies, which nobody believes promote competition, could be justified under the same thinking."
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.833,2400.361,"No, but it's a totally... I cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2455.577,2464.301,"In this particular case there is a complete alignment of incentives, because the manufacturer was also a retailer competing in this market."
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2467.924,2474.419,"Well, if that's the case and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2483.734,2493.642,"Well, Your Honor, we would suggest that the horizontal conspiracy between Leegin as a retailer and the other retailers offering his products is more than just a rule of reason approach."
2006.06-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.944,2542.074,"Mr. Coykendall, the... on the question... you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce it, Leegin?"
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2542.074,2542.923,Leegin.
2006.06-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2542.923,2543.474,Leegin.
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2549.727,2558.894,That particular aspect was referred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of this.
2006.06-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.666,2580.089,"Suppose you were to lose, you would still have that claim, I take it?"
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2580.089,2581.268,"Well, yes."
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.522,2654.898,"I don't suppose there's any... I don't suppose there's any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer, is there?"
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2672.977,2679.782,"Well, if... what you're doing is you're building in this high margin that gives the retailer an incentive to do that."
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.51,2699.056,You're assuming that the... that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good.
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2701.889,2705.068,"That's the only incentive, the only reason for imposing resale prices--"
2006.06-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.068,2710.761,He's only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants.
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2722.85,2734.748,"--Well, there are more efficient ways than RPM to achieve any benefits of efficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to provide those additional demand creating services."
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.087,2746.688,Why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance?
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2746.688,2751.531,The resale price maintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money at the problem.
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.323,2775.857,"Well, you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2783.824,2788.526,"--If you have a contract requiring those services, you don't need the minimum resale price."
2006.06-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.282,2804.866,Does that presume a contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for the service?
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2804.866,2806.398,It could be.
2006.06-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2807.607,2812.502,"If not, I don't see how that would work under your rule."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2812.502,2821.809,"Well, under... the idea is the manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers that offer this particular service."
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2882.607,2892.074,"Your reference to the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation that supports the result you seek."
2006.06-480,2,38903,robert_w_coykendall,,2892.074,2904.283,"Your Honor, as this Court observed in Sylvania, Congress by repealing the Miller-Tydings McGuire Act did indicate its support for the per se rule."
2006.06-480,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2907.515,2909.446,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2921.553,2924.394,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-480,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2967.454,2977.029,"Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2983.444,2983.844,No.
2006.06-480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.399,3023.158,I'm not sure it's often the case.
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3030.374,3045.654,"--Well, as you have observed, virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing function and become one entity instead of two entities."
2006.06-480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.9,3122.174,Were they relying on Dr. Miles or were they relying on us?
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3125.126,3125.416,They were relying--
2006.06-480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3125.416,3139.818,"They left the situation where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as determined by this Court, and we had shown our willingness to update the antitrust law when sound economic doctrine suggests is necessary."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3139.818,3140.147,--No.
2006.06-480,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3158.639,3162.702,"But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3164.092,3188.858,"--That's true, they did not do that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has established in the antitrust area, this rule has received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn the rule should be at its peek as compared with those other rules."
2006.06-480,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3283.991,3285.382,But they could.
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3295.749,3296.769,You could.
2006.06-480,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3308.488,3315.481,"But then the retailer, but then the retailer might have a real incentive not to do a good job on the service because they really want to market it for price, not for service."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3315.481,3333.854,"--That really depends, doesn't it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if it's correct, if the manufacturer... if the claim on behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the customers want is service, the retailers are in at least as good a position to identify that fact as not."
2006.06-480,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.635,3340.099,"Well, but there you have the free rider problem, which is you go to the fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then you buy it at the discount store."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3340.099,3340.977,--Yes.
2006.06-480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.77,3368.305,"But some manufacturers want their product associated with excellent service, high warranty, and all of that."
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3373.879,3374.39,"Yes, there is."
2006.06-480,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3408.832,3419.4,Am I correct on the congressional point that there was a period when Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General from making the argument he made today?
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3419.4,3420.65,"Yes, there was such a period."
2006.06-480,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3424.734,3429.545,So there was a legislative expression of a position on this particular issue?
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3429.545,3433.058,--There was a legislative expression of position on this particular issue.
2006.06-480,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3433.058,3435.051,And that no longer is applicable?
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3435.051,3442.714,"That is... the Solicitor General is no longer barred from making that argument, as is evidenced today."
2006.06-480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.185,3444.875,I guess Congress changed its mind then.
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3444.875,3453.771,"--No, I think Congress found it unnecessary or perhaps questioned the wisdom or constitutionality of barring the Solicitor General from making particular arguments."
2006.06-480,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3453.771,3455.343,I find it hard to believe that.
2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3455.982,3476.435,"But Congress has consistently... well, and the repeal... the reason the repeal of the Miller-Tydings Act seems particularly relevant is that it is indeed... it was an amendment to this statute that this Court is being asked to interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning of this statute as it stands."
2006.06-480,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3476.435,3482.309,"As Mr. Olson pointed out, under the fair trade laws this was per se legal."

2006.06-480,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3528.401,3536.286,"It has, but I would question the wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing Congress's views."
