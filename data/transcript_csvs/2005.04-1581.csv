2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.397,"We'll hear argument first today in No. 04-1581, Wisconsin Right to Life, Incorporated v. Federal Election Commission."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,9.491,13.179,"Thank you, and Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,38.466,45.186,"Mr. Bopp, right... right there I guess I... I have a problem with... with your argument, and I just want to get it out."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,179.341,187.988,"Well, there... there is a few specifics about the... about our ad that... that I would like to remind the Court of."
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,201.178,202.022,"Yes, but you didn't even give their phone numbers."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,202.022,214.953,"Well, and then it refers to a Web site, [befairDOTorg,] which contained prominently on the first page the phone numbers and addresses and all contact information for these two Senators."
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,233.936,234.27,Okay.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,242.834,247.793,"Well, it... it doesn't, the one that you mentioned, because it was just call them up and--"
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.793,276.368,"If... if it's the fact that you go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to make this what it was in McConnell which, by the way, we said was illegal, what they... the first thing they're going to see when they get to the Web site, which I agree with you... four times in 3 of the 12 sentences of this ad... in 3 of the 12... it says, [befairDOTorg,] visit [befairDOTorg,] go to [befairDOTorg.]"
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,309.786,310.202,"--Well, it--"
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,310.202,310.646,Doesn't it?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,310.646,311.096,--No.
2005.04-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.325,345.741,"Yes, but in McConnell--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,345.741,346.091,But if you are right--
2005.04-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.091,365.736,"--in McConnell, the Court said corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads during election blackout periods by simply avoiding any specific reference to Federal candidates or, in doubtful cases, by paying for the ad from a segregated fund."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,380.176,402.191,"Well, that... that part of the opinion needs to be read in light of the footnote, which is attached to those very words, which said in footnote 88 that the interests that support regulation of electioneering may not apply to genuine grassroots lobbying and distinguished the McConnell case from Bellotti and McIntyre."
2005.04-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.871,420.013,"Mr. Bopp, to what extent can we take into account the surrounding circumstances?"
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,466.622,475.863,"Well, of course, the final point is... is in the record, that... that is, it was... the... it was supposed to come to a head in November and then it did not."
2005.04-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.989,483.333,I... I don't... I don't understand what you just said.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,483.333,498.712,"--Well... well, the... the filibuster issue, as it related to that session of Congress, it was thought that it was going to come to a head in... in October... excuse me... but it... but as a... but it did not."
2005.04-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.838,511.308,"I mean, once it didn't come to a head in November and it was still an issue, why didn't you continue to run it?"
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,511.308,520.883,"Well, each organization has to make an assessment with respect to the different issues that they want to be lobbying on and the... their pressing nature."
2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,521.477,523.155,I thought your point was that it was not an issue after the election.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,523.155,529.875,"--Well... well, it was in the... in the next session of Congress and has been an... an issue."
2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,540.627,544.509,Were you taking a position on this issue prior to the election time frame?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,544.509,545.009,--Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,545.92,548.275,Had you taken out advertisements prior to that time frame?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,548.275,548.725,--Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.85,560.294,But the basic question I think is this.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,670.749,671.633,No.
2005.04-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,720.563,721.823,Can we return to--
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,721.823,722.44,These people are law making.
2005.04-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.44,725.211,"--Mr. Bopp, then can we return to my question?"
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,741.672,742.306,And I'm sorry.
2005.04-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.758,787.454,But the electorate will know that this issue is presented to them in connection with this Senator and that your organization has linked the two very clearly.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,787.454,798.622,"But, you know, the... the effect on an election is remote and speculative and not proven by... in terms of genuine issue ads in this record."
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,836.422,840.037,--Then why didn't we have to go the other way in the Chinese trade relation example?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,841.215,842.059,"Well, I don't think you--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,842.059,851.718,"--unless I'm missing something in your argument, everything you are saying in this argument could have been said with respect to that ad and, as Justice Breyer said, to a couple of others."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,851.718,855.916,--Well that may very well have been a genuine issue ad in the mind of this Court.
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.252,866.818,Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,866.818,867.929,"And there, you know--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,867.929,882.203,"And... and we... we cited some other examples as... as examples that, on the face of it and on the face of the record, would... would lawfully fall within the... the general rule that we said Congress could prescribe."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,882.203,897.415,"--Well... well, the Yellowtail ad, which you cited and quoted as a example of sham issue ad, said that the... Mr. Yellowtail had taken a swing at his wife and he justified that because he said he didn't hit her."
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,897.415,898.348,"No, but the point--"
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,898.348,900.519,And then it said basically call him up and yell at him.
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,900.519,913.133,"--But I... I don't want to cut you off from your Yellowtail argument, if... if you want to make it, but it seems to me that the problem in this case is that your ad is very much like a nonYellowtail ad."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,926.39,926.984,How could it be--
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,926.984,927.384,"No, no."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,928.828,929.422,--Sorry.
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.422,941.257,"Once you get out of the sphere of... of kind of sham ads that just hit you in your face, there isn't a practical way to tell the difference."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,968.565,972.597,"Well, as I was describing, the Yellowtail ad was--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,972.597,973.097,But Yellowtail--
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,973.097,974.024,--which involves very--
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.024,976.879,--is... is an ad of... an obviously sham ad.
2005.04-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.906,979.406,"Mr. Bopp, did... did the opinion refer to--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.406,979.9,--May... may I finish?
2005.04-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.9,980.3,--sham ads?
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,980.3,980.783,Excuse me.
2005.04-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.244,982.061,Did the opinion refer to--
2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,982.061,982.671,Justice Souter.
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,982.671,985.015,May I finish my question?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1010.768,1011.162,--Only on a facial challenge.
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.162,1019.626,"--Yes, but why doesn't your ad fall within the reasoning that we used in approving... on the facial challenge, in approving the statute?"
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1019.626,1028.273,Because the Broadrick facial challenge analysis that you engaged in in McConnell is not completed because that includes future as applied challenges.
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1029.962,1030.595,No... no question about it.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1030.595,1031.306,--7 percent--
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.306,1031.972,But your... your as applied--
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1031.972,1032.539,--genuine issue ads--
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1032.539,1043.141,"--challenge has got to have something different about it, something unusual that says this is why my ad does not fall within the general rule."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1044.152,1045.829,"--Well, I... I will repeat."
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1050.456,1053.144,Wasn't the Chinese trade issue currently pending?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1053.144,1055.238,"--Yes, it was, and you know, the Chinese--"
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1055.238,1056.165,So that's no difference.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1056.165,1061.291,"--But... but, Your Honor, the Chinese example was not cited by this Court."
2005.04-1581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1066.006,1066.239,Sure.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1066.239,1066.906,Okay?
2005.04-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.938,1090.421,May I--
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1090.421,1091.698,--petition the Government.
2005.04-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.698,1092.548,--may I ask one question just to find out?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1099.851,1105.477,"I think you can create objective criteria, just like this Court has--"
2005.04-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.477,1105.844,No.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1112.959,1120.856,"--Well, I... I think that you can adopt objective criteria as you have in the Noerr v. Pennington doctrine to separate the two."
2005.04-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.856,1122.95,Are you able to answer my question yes or no?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1122.95,1125.471,I... I would say no.
2005.04-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.471,1128.743,You're not claiming there are separate categories.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1128.743,1131.097,"Then I misunderstood your question, Your Honor."
2005.04-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.291,1136.889,So it's either... it's either an issue ad or it's a candidate ad.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1136.889,1137.223,--Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1160.738,1166.292,Does the... does the FEC draw... distinguish between sham ads and genuine issue ads?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1166.292,1170.49,"--No, the... no, they haven't."
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1215.594,1216.022,All right.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1228.368,1229.284,Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.284,1232.566,Run an ad that just speaks about a group of Senators.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1267.595,1283.13,"I think that you would look at, one, whether the... the ad discusses a current legislative issue; two, whether or not it made any reference to the legislator beyond lobbying him or her about that specific issue."
2005.04-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1373.357,1381.422,"Now, this ad could have been run by your clients by a segregated fund."
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1381.422,1381.939,--Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1386.287,1386.881,It just ran out of money.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1387.531,1390.236,"--Well, that was only part of it."
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1427.969,1428.969,All right.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1429.696,1431.24,Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1431.24,1432.584,And a corporation?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1432.584,1434.095,Yes.
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1437.033,1437.31,All right.
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1481.13,1481.624,"--Yes, but--"
2005.04-1581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.624,1484.396,It becomes a question of motive and how do we know what the motive is?
2005.04-1581,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1484.396,1486.156,--That's not what advocacy groups are doing.
2005.04-1581,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.507,1562.934,"Thank you, Mr. Bopp."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1565.039,1569.915,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1582.094,1590.908,"In McConnell against FEC, you stood there and told us that this was a facial challenge and that as applied challenges could be brought in the future."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1596.368,1597.379,No.
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.821,1630.813,Is there any other case that you can cite where we've upheld a facial challenge and then later said that an as applied challenge was barred by our ruling on the facial challenge?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1630.813,1634.929,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I will answer it, and I... and I think actually--"
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.929,1636.773,"Like Justice Stevens, I think that's a yes or no."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1637.45,1638.544,--Okay.
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1638.844,1639.527,What--
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1639.527,1639.988,Lane and Hibbs.
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1651.223,1651.807,I... I beg your pardon.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1653.001,1653.911,--Lane and Hibbs.
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1659.205,1659.966,"--Well, that's a very different question."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1685.835,1688.012,--I don't think this Court has--
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.012,1695.411,"Well, it would be like in any of those cases where you have a... a broad prohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations where it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid on its face."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1703.391,1714.477,"--Well, I think the case really hasn't arisen because generally when this Court clearly identifies an area where Congress can regulate in prophylactic terms, somebody doesn't come back in and try to bring the exact same challenge."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1738.42,1744.046,"Well, it might have been that 90 feet included a public street and you couldn't go down a public street without... so... and so--"
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1744.046,1745.64,"--Well, Justice Kennedy--"
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1745.64,1752.026,--It... it does seems strange to me in a speech case to say we're foreclosing as applied challenges.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1752.026,1753.871,"--And... and, Justice Kennedy, please understand me."
2005.04-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.287,1778.424,"Well, I suppose you can say, yes, you can have an as applied challenge, but this one doesn't meet the test."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1778.424,1780.085,"--Exactly, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.295,1795.453,"So let's say you had an organization that every month of every year it took out an ad the first week of every month, and it said the same thing and it said, contact your Senators."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1811.081,1814.352,"Mr. Chief Justice, that would be a better as applied challenge."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.515,1837.795,"If we want to place an ad in October, the solution is to place an ad November through September, and then we're okay."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1841.333,1842.644,"--No, no."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.644,1844.265,That's a pretty broad definition of a sham.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1844.265,1845.015,"No, no."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.072,1868.708,"But on an issue like this, the filibuster, it's the Senators who are doing it, and their ad referred to not only the Senator who was up for election, but the one who was not."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1868.708,1881.138,"I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think if you focus in on this particular ad, you will see that whatever the true intent of the advertisers here, this is the kind of ad that clearly would have an impact on the election."
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.369,1898.361,You think Congress has the power to prohibit any First Amendment contact... conduct that might have an impact on the election?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1902.559,1904.747,"No, Justice Scalia, it's not."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.417,1924.825,So you think there is a compelling interest in preventing people from thinking about an issue and then calling their Senator during the blackout period.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1927.596,1928.857,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1950.862,1955.988,Are... are Web sites and chat rooms covered by the McCain Feingold?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1955.988,1957.332,"No, they're not, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.509,1959.426,"But certainly under your view, they ought to be."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1968.251,1969.595,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.098,1981.958,"Well, why... why not?"
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1990.256,1996.392,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I... I'm not sure you really do think that... that McCain Feingold should be extended to that."
2005.04-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.169,2021.929,What is the difference with this?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2068.458,2098.528,"Well, I... I want to be responsive and I think the way to respond is that this Court's decision recognized that these ads were going to be difficult to classify and that you needed some kind of bright line rule and that the consequences of having a bright line rule in this consequence... in this area weren't terrible because there were alternative ways for them to communicate either through a separate, segregated fund which served the issue of the interests of the statute or by avoiding the kind of references that would raise serious questions about tying the ad to a candidate election."
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.875,2114.49,What was the bright line rule that... that you think the... the opinion established?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2132.723,2139.193,I think all issue ads that come within the statutory prohibition are permissibly regulable.
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.693,2142.815,No issue ads during the... the blackout.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2142.815,2148.175,"--Sure, you can run issue ads as long as you either fund them through a separate, segregated fund or you--"
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.175,2148.519,No--
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2148.519,2149.702,--omit the reference to the candidate.
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.702,2150.546,"--Oh, of course, I know."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2150.546,2151.207,And... and--
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.207,2151.74,And stand on your head.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2169.546,2173.745,--I think that this... I do think that is what the opinion says and stands for.
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.089,2177.183,Why does it speak about sham issue ads?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2177.183,2196.676,"--Well, Justice Scalia, for one thing, I think it's important to recognize that the discussion about sham versus genuine issue ads was really a factor of the fact that necessarily in looking at the record there, what the Court had to do is look at ads that were run in previous election cycles where this regulatory structure wasn't in place and try to classify those ads."
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.179,2210.617,Why did you say there were 7 percent of these that... that are probably okay?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2210.617,2215.076,I'm not sure which figure Mr. Bopp is referring to as the 7 percent figure.
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.825,2261.457,"I... I deny the first thing, that it's easy to do issue ads without naming the candidate."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2278.33,2282.362,"Well, Justice Scalia, they didn't even do that in this ad, as has already been pointed out."
2005.04-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.385,2301.512,"Could they have said in the ad, call your elected representatives, not naming any names?"
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2301.512,2303.95,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, they also could have done that."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2311.931,2312.497,General--
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.497,2316.963,That may be because the people who were doing the filibuster were the Senators.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2321.255,2333.008,"--Well, and again, Mr. Chief Justice, though, I mean, fair enough, but I think you also have to keep in mind that this is a context where this filibuster issue isn't some idiosyncratic interest of the appellant here."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.002,2360.399,The fact that it mentions both... the fact that it mentions both Senators strongly suggests to me that it's concerned about the issue because one of the Senators wasn't up for election.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2360.399,2366.126,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that gets back to Justice Stevens' question as to whether or not these categories are mutually exclusive."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2391.395,2394.5,"--And they... and they could have... they could have named Senator Kohl, I take it."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2394.5,2396.76,"--They... they could have, Senator Kennedy."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2396.76,2398.615,It's such an odd calculus.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2408.606,2410.217,Obviously--
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.217,2412.806,And that's... and that's the one area where the ad is prohibited.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2412.806,2428.434,"--Obviously, you're right, Justice Kennedy, but obviously, there are concerns that are implicated when somebody is running in cycle and the ad has targeted the electorate in the immediate run up to the election that aren't present there with Senator Kohl and, therefore, the Congress has... has struck a different balance in that case."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2450.272,2460.441,"Well, if you're trying to influence the Senators who are presumably or possibly in their home State during a recess, that's perfect timing to influence the Senators who are the ones engaging in the filibuster--"
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2460.441,2461.702,I'm not sure I would--
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2461.702,2463.296,--without regard to whether they're running for election or not.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2463.296,2467.994,"--With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure I'd pick day 4 of the August recess to do that."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.929,2502.923,I've lost track of it.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2510.354,2515.464,"Well, no, I think my answer to that would be that we'd still be here suggesting that that's controlled."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2543.855,2549.148,"So you do... you do an ideological history, an ideological pedigree of various speakers."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2558.973,2564.015,"--Well, I mean, that may speak about where the ACLU is going."
2005.04-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2588.114,2589.008,But--
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2589.008,2590.052,The FEC administer that.
2005.04-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.552,2592.062,--That's what I want to know exactly.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2640.048,2641.792,"--No, you're not wrong, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.802,2643.813,"Well, why haven't they done it?"
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2667.344,2669.682,"--Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer both questions."
2005.04-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2725.549,2725.916,General--
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2725.916,2727.06,--unless you're exceedingly careful.
2005.04-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2727.06,2732.602,"--General Clement, if you could clarify for me some... a response that Mr. Bopp gave."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2743.022,2755.618,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, as I understand the record, the first effort to broadcast this ad was on, I think, July 26th, and that was sort of a few days before the... the cutoff period would kick in."
2005.04-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2777.956,2780.494,May I ask you one other thing about the setting?
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2793.418,2799.294,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I... I don't have as good an answer for that as I would like because the... the Web site is now defunct."
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.607,2867.84,"General Clement, you... you've pointed out the difficulties, but I don't know any other area where we said, well, you know, the... the... when you're dealing with important... important freedoms, important guarantees, where we shrug our shoulders and say, well, the only way to accomplish what the Government wants to do is to ride right... right over those guarantees."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2883.041,2884.218,--Justice Scalia--
2005.04-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.218,2895.981,"--the... the right which I think applies to corporations, as well as to anybody else, and for individuals to associate with one another to bring to bear influence on the legislative process."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2909.589,2912.043,"--Well, I hope that's not the case, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.906,2992.341,"Both of those examples, of course, are quantities, and once you... I think it was Holmes who said, once you admit the necessity of drawing a line, you know, you can always find something on one side or the other."
2005.04-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3006.943,3010.475,And... and the difference... the difference is this is a content based inquiry.
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3010.475,3025.009,"--Well but, Justice Kennedy, precisely because you can't engage in just a formless content based inquiry and precisely because there isn't any neat division between issue ads and candidate ads, that is why you need to have a different regulatory approach."
2005.04-1581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.103,3035.845,"I think the real bottom line for the... your opponent is that even a pure election ad should get the same constitutional protection as an issue ad, which is something we've rejected."
2005.04-1581,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3035.845,3037.273,"--Absolutely, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1581,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3224.323,3225.761,"Thank you, General."
2005.04-1581,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3228.205,3230.626,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.184,3266.488,"There is a vast difference, but the question I have is whether Congress has any voice in trying to draw the line that divides the two categories."
2005.04-1581,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3266.488,3273.224,"--I think they do, and they drew a line that was upheld on its face because the vast majority of ads--"
2005.04-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.224,3282.96,"And... and if we are in a gray area that there's some who could say it's issue and some could say it's electioneering, do we owe any deference to Congress' test that it has drafted?"
2005.04-1581,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3282.96,3285.22,--I... I don't think you owe deference to the test.
2005.04-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.745,3306.059,So your position basically would say we should take all of these cases on a case by case basis and not give any presumptive weight to what... what Congress has done.
2005.04-1581,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3306.059,3306.625,No.
2005.04-1581,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3465.489,3469.489,"Thank you, Mr. Bopp. The case is submitted."
