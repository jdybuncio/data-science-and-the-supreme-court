1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.435,We will hear arguments first this morning in National Labor Relations Board against Transportation Management Corporation.
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,14.09,44.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, for the third time this term I am here to discuss burdens of persuasion and burdens of production, this time in the context of the National Labor Relations Board's allocation of burdens of proof in a proceeding under Section 8(a)(3) of the Act charging a discharge of an employee for anti-union animus."
1982.82-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.969,120.312,Have you decided what time you will receive questions from the bench?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,120.312,125.637,"Well, of course, I am just explaining why I am not starting with the facts, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,129.276,134.29,"Well, at least they are received, even if not welcomed."
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,135.478,174.883,"To begin with in such a proceeding the general counsel, of course, has a burden of production and a burden of persuasion to show that... we'll talk about discharges here, although this applies to any 8(a)(3) case and to many 8(a)(1) cases involving other adverse action, but to show that the discharge was improperly motivated, that anti-union animus generally was a motivating factor in the meaning of this Court's decision."
1982.82-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.127,391.092,"Mr. Wallace, does the Board actually conduct the presentation of testimony in this kind of segmented way?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,391.092,393.481,--It is not... it is not segmented this way.
1982.82-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.23,403.931,"Why does it help the Board, if I might ask, to have these various presumptions and burdens of persuasion?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,450.615,471.074,"Well, it's arguable that the ball would move with greater ease without it, but this is what the Board has been doing to explain its decisions, and it is the context against which Congress legislated in Taft-Hartley in revising the law."
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.196,987.444,"In that respect, does the Board call it its Wright-Line test?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,990.162,991.49,It is the Wright-Line test now.
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.49,992.083,But that is a 1980--
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,992.083,993.036,That is correct.
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.036,1000.329,--And when was the earliest... what was the earliest Board's case that articulated that?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1000.329,1013.448,"Well, the first one that we cite is Dow Chemical in 1939, and the one that we have quoted on Page 16 is also a 1939 case, and--"
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.448,1018.025,And was it changed at all in Wright-Line?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1018.025,1027.428,"--We don't think Wright-Line meant to change the standard at all, but it meant to articulate it with the help of this Court's opinion in Mt."
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.802,1032.832,"Well, it didn't need any help if it was so clear from the statutory language and history, did it?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1032.832,1067.271,"Well, it wasn't always articulated well by the Board, and the reason for this is that until Wright-Line, in the cases in which the Board was ruling for the general counsel and holding that the employer did not sustain its burden of proving that the discharge or other adverse action would have occurred anyway, the Board tended to articulate the dual motive aspect of the case."
1982.82-168,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1164.84,1174.165,"Mr. Wallace, how far from the position taken by the AFL-CIO in its brief is the Board's position?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1174.165,1186.723,"It is very similar, but the Board has chosen not to issue a remedy at all in cases in which the employer has sustained the burden."
1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1284.822,1287.072,You are speaking now of the Board or the hearing examiner?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1287.072,1287.243,The Board.
1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.009,1290.351,How about the hearing examiner?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1290.351,1291.867,"--Well, they follow--"
1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.867,1292.226,Is it the same?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1292.226,1294.632,"--Of course it's the same, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.632,1298.364,"May I ask a similar question, Mr. Wallace, right on this?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1311.594,1313.905,"Well, it depends on the evidence of what."
1982.82-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.905,1321.449,Evidence on the issue of whether or not actual anti-union animus was a motivating factor.
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1321.449,1329.632,"On that, the general counsel has the burden of proof, and he must satisfy the Board by a preponderance of the evidence."
1982.82-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.632,1333.147,"Well, then, does the general counsel differ from Judge Briar's view of the case?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1333.147,1367.961,"Well, I have to regard Judge Briar's opinion as an example of trying to fit all categories of cases into a framework that is suitable only for some categories, and not recognizing that there is this other category of cases where the general counsel has persuaded the Board that there was a true dual motivation, and the question is then who has the burden of proof of persuasion on the question of whether hypothetically the discharge would have occurred anyway."
1982.82-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.961,1371.085,"Well, but in the category, not the Mt."
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1377.661,1378.176,That is correct.
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.176,1391.233,"Well, is it that the general counsel must prove a discriminatory motive or anti-union bias?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1392.921,1396.59,He has to prove that it was a motivating factor.
1982.82-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.59,1397.371,A motivating factor.
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1397.371,1403.385,"A motivating factor, as this Court used that term in Arlington Heights and in Mt."
1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1404.197,1414.631,Would it be enough if the evidence showed that the employer was generally hostile to having a union organized?
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1414.631,1421.034,"By and large, that would not be enough."
1982.82-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1494.489,1509.092,"Mr. Wallace, I thought there had been some suggestion in the cases, anyway, that what the general counsel has to prove is that the employee would not have been fired but for the union activity."
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1509.092,1520.947,--There is the way that some of the Courts of Appeals have expressed a disagreement with the Board on who has the burden of persuasion as to the affirmative defense.
1982.82-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1544.343,1554.198,"Well, now, on the legislative history, I guess the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit would read it and come to a conclusion different than yours."
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1554.198,1573.597,"--Well, I am aware of that, but to me the most dispositive thing in the legislative history I have not yet gotten to, and I want to point out to the Court, and that is something quoted on Page 20 from Senator Ball, right beneath the quotation that we have of Senator Taft."
1982.82-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.02,1687.238,"May I just ask you one question, Mr. Wallace?"
1982.82-168,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1693.954,1699.046,"I believe they are, but that is debatable."
1982.82-168,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.046,1705.637,Mr. Ames.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,1705.637,1724.677,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case involves the proper allocation of the burden of proof when an employer is charged with discriminatory employment conduct in violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act."
1982.82-168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.36,1783.574,"Mr. Ames, how do you respond to the legislative history argument based on Senator Ball's statement as articulated by Mr. Wallace?"
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,1783.574,1794.243,"I think the legislative history, Justice O'Connor, is not ambiguous on the issue as to who has the ultimate burden of proof."
1982.82-168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1800.303,1804.739,"Well, how do you deal with Senator Ball's language specifically?"
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,1804.739,1822.465,"--I believe that when you deal with Senator Ball, there is a comment that is contra to the legislative language itself."
1982.82-168,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.777,1911.992,"If the statement that Justice O'Connor has just referred to had been made by Senator Taft rather than another Senator, would that give you more trouble?"
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,1911.992,1916.599,"Senator Taft's statements, I believe... No, it would not."
1982.82-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.712,2063.898,The employer could respond certainly in two different ways.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2109.928,2114.691,"Justice White, I think the Board in all honesty is confused."
1982.82-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.009,2150.085,"Well, he could come forward and say, I didn't do it at all."
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2153.161,2155.879,"Yes, he might, and in fact I might--"
1982.82-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.879,2157.988,And he might win on that basis.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2157.988,2161.016,"--In fact, I might comment, Justice White, that that is what happens generally in these cases."
1982.82-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.716,2172.949,"Well, if he does that, the general counsel still has the burden of proof."
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2172.949,2173.465,--Of course.
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.199,2220.589,"Mr. Ames, I am not sure you have responded to the second half of Justice White's question."
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2248.172,2253.591,"No, Justice Stevens, I would not agree."
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.591,2253.888,No?
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2253.888,2264.9,"Because the employer doesn't come forward and say anything other than, I fired him... before he does that, he denies that he has done anything wrong."
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.9,2268.538,I am assuming a case in which he admits the anti-union bias.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2276.629,2281.08,"The numbers of cases that occurs are very small, I would say."
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.08,2284.391,"Well, I know, but I am asking you about that hypothetical case."
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2284.391,2291.686,If he confesses that he harbored the improper motivation--
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.686,2292.45,And that that was part of his decision.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2292.45,2298.072,"--and that led to... that was part of his decision, and he also had evidence of thievery--"
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.072,2303.352,"No, he didn't even have the evidence of thievery until after he had fired him, just to make it a really clearcut case."
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2317.738,2324.234,"--I would think I would refer then back to what I think Section 8(a)(3) is all about, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.241,2346.116,Right.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2346.116,2360.954,"In the hypothetical you have presented to me, in fact, he might harbor this impermissible discriminatory motivation, but he now has some showing to make that the employee engaged in misconduct."
1982.82-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.326,2374.729,Under Justice Stevens' hypothetical the employer found out about the thievery after he had fired the guy.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2378.635,2379.588,--Yes.
1982.82-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.588,2381.758,It just wouldn't be a defense.
1982.82-168,1,35395,martin_ames,,2393.831,2409.826,"In the hypo as I understand it now, that is correct, but in the instant at bar, the evidence of misconduct occurred or came to the attention of the respondent prior to even any engagement in protected union activity."
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3004.914,3012.209,I would just like to point out to the Court that this is not a case in which the evidence was thin.
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.478,3124.273,"Well, how could an Administrative Law Judge really make an error like that, if things had been so clear all these years?"
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3124.664,3133.333,"Well, as I say, part of the mission of the Wright-Line decision was to attempt to--"
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.333,3135.114,Was to clarify what hadn't been so clear.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3135.114,3143.798,--To get more uniformity of application of what the rule had been right along and what Congress had approved in Taft-Hartley.
1982.82-168,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3143.798,3156.652,"Mr. Wallace, how would you respond to Justice Stevens' question as to the situation in which the employer discovered the day after that the employee was a thief?"
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3156.652,3172.723,"Well, I think that would be an affirmative defense that would go to remedy, and would show that reinstatement would not be appropriate, even though a violation had occurred, because at the time of the discharge it was solely for improper purpose."
1982.82-168,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3172.723,3173.755,What about back pay?
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3173.755,3184.375,"Back pay, I am not positive what the Board would do, but they certainly would not award back pay for more than the one day."
1982.82-168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.375,3185.062,One day.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3190.731,3192.761,"Well, it was--"
1982.82-168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.761,3193.933,In the Board... in this context.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3193.933,3203.68,"--It is to prove the hypothetical that the discharge would have occurred even in the absence of the improper motivation, just as it was in Mt."
1982.82-168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.055,3210.084,And does it apply when there is proof that the Board accepts that there was in fact an actual anti-union animus?
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3210.084,3213.77,"Yes, that is... that is where it applies."
1982.82-168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.302,3217.113,Why is that different from my thief case?
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3218.222,3233.029,"Well, in the thief case, the discharge took place before they knew that he was a thief, so there wasn't a dual motive for the discharge, but there now would be a legitimate reason in retrospect for the discharge."
1982.82-168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.029,3241.149,"I see, but you would say the difference is, if you knew he was a thief at the time you discharged him, but the thievery was only one of the reasons."
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3241.149,3248.242,"Yes, but if you could show that it would have been a sufficient reason in itself, and would have produced the same result."
1982.82-168,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3248.242,3253.458,Let me clarify something at least for my own reactions.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3285.132,3301.189,"I doubt that the Board would reinstate him at all in that situation, but they would probably issue a cease and desist order telling the employer to cease and desist for taking adverse action against employees because of their union activities, as they did in this case."
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.094,3315.901,But... I take it the Board's Wright-Line test in this very case would not... it would not result in a conclusion by the Board that there had been an unfair labor practice if the employer carries his burden.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3315.901,3317.462,That is correct.
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.462,3321.993,And you wouldn't... so that he couldn't be posted or there couldn't be a cease or desist order.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3321.993,3323.163,That is the Board's--
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.163,3326.115,"Under the AFL-CIO position, there could be a cease and desist order--"
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3326.115,3326.272,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.272,3327.771,--and there could be posting.
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3327.771,3337.346,"Then that is... well, there is a practice under Title 7 that an injunction would issue even though the same result would have been reached for legitimate reasons."
1982.82-168,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.39,3350.714,"Well, that may be, but the Board's view is that if the employer carries his burden, there has been no unfair labor practice."
1982.82-168,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3350.714,3351.308,That is correct.
1982.82-168,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.745,3355.915,"Thank you, gentlemen."
