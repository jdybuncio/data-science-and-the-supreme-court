1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.487,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-746, Michael H. and Victoria D. v. Gerald D.."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,10.856,11.606,Thank you.
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.987,91.741,"This was while the mother was married to Gerald, right?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,91.741,95.843,"I believe that all of the events I'm describing, Your Honor, occurred while--"
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,95.843,96.962,They have never been divorced?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,96.962,98.778,--Not to my knowledge.
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.926,174.212,How long was that period in all?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,174.212,178.68,"There were two separate periods, the one I've just described--"
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.68,181.532,When the child was living with Michael.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,181.532,183.734,"--As I say, there were two separate periods."
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.376,198.743,"August to April, eight months."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,201.645,202.479,I accept your arithmetic.
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.479,203.731,"What, what was the other period?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,203.731,212.337,"The other period was a period in, for about three months in early 1982, January, February, and March."
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.074,223.193,And that contrasts to how much of a period that the child was living with Gerald?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,223.193,226.847,--As of May of 1984?
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.649,233.434,As of the time of the decision below.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,233.434,244.891,"--Oh, as of the time... in January of 1985, as of the time of the summary judgment being granted to Gerald, I would say that Gerald probably had the edge in terms of time."
1988.87-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,246.608,249.276,"Well, you know he had the edge, by a good deal, no."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,251.128,253.997,"Well, yes, they are, and I'm not trying to play with them."
1988.87-746,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,434.732,439.218,"Mr. Boraks, where is Victoria now?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,439.218,444.27,"Well, I'm not entirely sure, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.943,454.228,Mr. Boraks--
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,454.228,455.595,Justice O'Connor.
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.595,474.392,--I guess this Court has articulated the view that the biological relationship of the father with the child alone is not sufficient to give him any Constitutionally protected liberty interest in that relationship.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,510.565,512.048,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.442,530.894,So it could be a month or so and that would be enough?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,530.894,532.044,"--If, if--"
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.044,532.927,A week.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,532.927,537.881,"--If that were enough, in fact, which I doubt it could be--"
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.881,540.35,So it is quantitative in a sense.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,540.35,543.952,"--No, it's qualitative, but there's a relationship between quantity and quality."
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,570.852,582.827,"What you're asking for on behalf of the father is a recognition of a right to a hearing, to establish the parental relationship."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,583.627,584.362,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.362,590.1,"Would there any, be anything at issue in that hearing other than that parental relationship?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,592.266,594.902,"Well, that has never--"
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.902,595.837,Or visitation.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,595.837,598.437,--That has never... custody has not come up in this case.
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.179,614.529,Let me ask you this.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,637.962,646.317,"I can't cite chapter and verse of why I believe this is so, but I do believe that the child would be entitled to--"
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.317,647.15,As a matter of California law.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,647.15,651.102,"--I believe as a matter of California law, and I believe as a matter of Constitutional law."
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,651.102,660.077,Then why would we have to address here any question concerning the child's Constitutionally protected liberty interest?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,664.029,667.647,I think that they're reciprocal in nature.
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.968,675.67,"Well, that's a pretty big unanswered question."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,690.061,690.763,I understand.
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.522,712.609,Are you going to argue here this morning that she is entitled in her own right to have that hearing?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,712.609,731.071,"Well, I was certainly planning to argue that the failure to hold a hearing, the failure to inquire into, on the merits into the issue of where her best interests lay is a Constitutional deprivation with respect to her."
1988.87-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,739.058,743.129,"Well, suppose there's been an adoption proceeding, and some child has been adopted."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,753.234,758.804,"Well, with whom the child has had a relationship?"
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.66,778.635,"And I suppose the child in this case could, if the parent, if parentage was proven, could ask for support."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,778.635,788.258,"The, the notion of a support obligation was inherent in Michael H.'s complaint."
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.526,793.561,"I know but, I know he understood it, but whether he understood it or not--"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,793.561,794.044,--Right.
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.661,800.965,--I suppose the child could press for support if the child proved the parentage.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,800.965,801.481,--Right.
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.035,813.373,So any time a wife has a child by somebody other than the husband it kind of becomes a menage a trois?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,819.795,822.045,"Well, not any time, Your Honor, because--"
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.045,824.997,"Well, with one, one week, you said, would be enough."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,824.997,826.866,"--No, I hope I didn't say that."
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.506,841.642,"But it would be, it would be a factual determination in every case."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,857.068,875.363,"--What the rule has to be, Your Honor, we contend, is that any time a relationship has been established between natural father and natural child which qualifies for a liberty interest under this Court's test, that any time that occurs there must be a hearing."
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.363,876.796,"Well, but that's tautological."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,880.564,884.735,It's a relationship that has two elements.
1988.87-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.18,910.953,"Well, what if, what if the natural father comes over to the house and says, I want to see my natural father, the husband says, get out of here."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,918.54,922.176,"Well, that's harder question, and not one that I have to answer for this case."
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.95,969.657,But as far as the child is concerned it seems to me it wouldn't make any difference whether there's been a father-child relationship established.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,980.93,983.882,Well--
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.882,985.517,Isn't that right?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,985.517,995.29,"--I... no, I don't think the child has a Constitutional right in the absence of a relationship to support."
1988.87-746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.424,1043.79,"I'm somewhat surprised you conceded in your answer to the Chief Justice that the father does not have the right to establish the relation, because under your theory of the case it's the father's natural expectations, his great desire to be a father that is really the propelling force of your case."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1060.065,1071.687,"Well, the reason I answered the Chief Justice the way I do is because I feel compelled to answer within the parameters of this Court's decision."
1988.87-746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.687,1081.561,"Well, we're trying to, we're trying to explore the dimensions and the articulation of the theory that we would have to adopt in order to rule for you in this case."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1081.561,1092.35,"Well, I don't want to discourage the Court from adopting a principle that mere biological paternity, that being a natural father in and of itself gives rise to certain rights."
1988.87-746,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.35,1097.071,But it seemed to me by your answer to the Chief Justice you foreclose that.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1097.071,1100.856,"Well, I've only not argued it."
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.763,1175.19,"Well, absent, absent this relationship you talk about, if Gerald had, had asked to adopt the girl... Victoria, is that her name?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1175.19,1176.223,Victoria.
1988.87-746,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.223,1182.677,"Would, would he have had to give notice to Michael?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1182.677,1185.879,"Absent the relationship, Justice White."
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.641,1216.683,"Mr. Boraks, do any of those prior decisions involve the situation where the relationship has already been terminated, where the termination is not imposed by the state?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1253.356,1254.456,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.164,1268.633,"Well, I don't know what you mean by visitation rights."
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1268.633,1272.402,"Well, he had an... he was awarded pendente lite visitation."
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.71,1284.912,You're asking the state to create a liberty interest that he doesn't now have.
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1298.302,1305.175,"In order to answer that question I think one has to focus, has to look at a particular point in time."
1988.87-746,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.799,1318.799,Who terminated that?
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1320.001,1320.818,No.
1988.87-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.568,1325.287,"And he didn't sue Carole, did he?"
1988.87-746,0,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,1326.572,1328.555,"Well, he did sue her originally."
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1517.445,1523.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.709,1622.494,"Well, he had lived with the child for about three months."
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1622.494,1625.696,The three months that I think Mr. Boraks refers to is--
1988.87-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.696,1626.479,January through March.
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1626.479,1627.029,--A period of about six-weeks--
1988.87-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.029,1627.929,Pardon me?
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1627.929,1635.635,"--It happens to span the end of January to the beginning of March of 1982, which was when Victoria was approximately seven months old."
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.019,1820.087,Is the mother in that case acting on behalf of the child?
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1820.087,1825.475,--I think the mother's interests are coincident with the child's interests in respect to their desire for support.
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.475,1826.641,So whether or not--
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1826.641,1827.275,I think the state's interest is the same.
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.275,1835.664,"--Whether or not there's been any relationship between the biological father and the child, the mother and the child are entitled to go after him for support."
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1835.664,1836.197,Precisely.
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.054,1854.708,"So the daughter has a right to have a hearing as to whether that father, that person is her father."
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1854.708,1868.302,"--The biological, the person who's biologically responsible, no, because in this case, in a case which is governed by Section 621 where there is a... my client tells you that you don't need to establish the support obligation of Michael."
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.276,1881.109,"I know, I understand."
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1881.109,1883.644,The issue of support isn't implicated in this case.
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.644,1892.417,"But in my example, an unwilling biological father can be sued by the mother and the child for support."
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1892.417,1892.934,Yes.
1988.87-746,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.6,1896.719,And they both are entitled to a hearing to establish paternity.
1988.87-746,1,34580,larry_m_hoffman,,1896.719,1899.821,For the purpose of establishing his support obligation.
1988.87-746,2,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,2962.355,2963.373,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3031.767,3038.338,Does the presumption apply when the husband and wife are cohabiting on the date of birth?
1988.87-746,2,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,3038.338,3042.307,"--I think the presumption is geared to conception, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3043.409,3044.375,Do California cases say that?
1988.87-746,2,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,3044.375,3058.502,"--Well, if you look at the statutory scheme, there's a whole set of these rebuttable presumptions that have to do with the status of marriage as of the time of the child's birth."
1988.87-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.723,3092.906,You say Victoria asked for visitation?
1988.87-746,2,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,3093.675,3094.908,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.908,3096.341,How old was the child when she made this--
1988.87-746,2,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,3096.341,3098.377,"Well, the guardian ad litem asked for visitation."
1988.87-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.377,3102.531,"--And how does the guardian ad litem get the authority... I mean, just, well I'm a little puzzled by that."
1988.87-746,2,38715,robert_aw_boraks,,3102.531,3111.268,"Well, I think the guardian ad litem has an obligation to act in what she perceived to be the child's best interest under the circumstances."
1988.87-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.745,3178.112,"Thank you, Mr. Boraks."
