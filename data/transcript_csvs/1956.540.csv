1956.540,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.665,"Number 540, Civil Aeronautics Board, Petitioner, versus Ida Mae Hermann, et al."
1956.540,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,14.332,20.289,May it please the Court.
1956.540,1,39406,roland_e_ginsburg,,1553.552,1556.288,May it please the Court.
1956.540,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1613.066,1618.427,Would you be good enough to state what you conceive to be the decision of the Court of Appeals there?
1956.540,1,39406,roland_e_ginsburg,,1618.427,1620.603,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.540,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1641.308,1643.585,But it gave them -- gave them some instructions or criteria --
1956.540,1,39406,roland_e_ginsburg,,1643.585,1644.203,"Yes, yes sir."
1956.540,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1644.203,1645.448,-- by which they've decided.
1956.540,1,39406,roland_e_ginsburg,,1645.448,1646.11,"Yes, yes Mr. Justice."
1956.540,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1646.11,1648.128,What was it?
1956.540,1,39406,roland_e_ginsburg,,1648.128,1654.196,The -- the discussion in the Court of Appeals opinion with regard to the enforcement --
1956.540,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1654.196,1656.447,"May I ask you, the District Court didn't decide."
1956.540,1,39406,roland_e_ginsburg,,1658.179,1668.029,"Well, the District Court made a decision, Your Honor, but if the District Court did not decide what the Court of Appeals conceive to be the legal issues in the case, and we agree with the Court of Appeals."
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3643.137,3667.046,"Well, if -- the difficulty I have with that is whether he's still urging that the District Court has to examine as to the various documents individually as to relevancy or materiality or whether he concedes that the general categories, if they're generally found to be irrelevant."
1956.540,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3677.294,3678.907,They're two different questions.
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3678.907,3680.319,-- unless they come forth.
1956.540,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3680.319,3682.092,There are two -- two different questions.
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3682.092,3682.794,Yes.
1956.540,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3682.794,3694.616,"I thought he was very clear in saying, he does not stand, he rejects the suggestion that the individual document must be just -- the relevance of it must be justified."
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3714.956,3722.344,"I would not want to urge that the fact the Board asked for them alone, but in the context of their complaint."
1956.540,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3741.168,3749.378,"But you wouldn't disagree with him that he -- that you go to Court and ask for enforcement, to say class one document."
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3771.293,3771.655,Not at all.
1956.540,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3771.655,3774.615,To make such a representation and have the Court rule on it.
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3774.615,3776.136,I would not.
1956.540,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3776.136,3792.945,"General, what -- what is your position in regard to the statement of Mr. Ginsburg that this gets down practically to the -- the proposition as to whether the record should come to you or you should go to the records?"
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,3792.945,3796.526,My position on behalf of the Government is that it's not correct.
1956.540,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4042.246,4058.417,"What you're saying is, therefore, at least, the inference I draw from what you say is that when Judge Hall said by laying the subpoena alongside the charges in the complaint, this Court cannot say, “these are irrelevant.”"
1956.540,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,4064.707,4067.419,That's the way we read it.
