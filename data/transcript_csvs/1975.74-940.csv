1975.74-940,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.993,We will hear arguments next in 940 Colorado River Conservation District against the United States and the consolidated case.
1975.74-940,0,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,52.262,56.129,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1272.84,1277.559,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1975.74-940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.445,1313.575,MMr. Shapiro the merits of that pupfish claim that your colleague Mr. Randolph argued on Monday were before is not -- there maybe some spill over at least in the minds that some of us between the two.
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1337.74,1350.448,"The basic claim is for stock watering, camp sites, the preservation of streams, waters sources for wild life."
1975.74-940,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.269,1389.653,You mean all the rights it claimed?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1389.653,1418.078,"All rights, the Indian Rights, well the entire range of a Federal Reservations, you come out with a percentage of something like -- well 2.2 million acre feet out of 363 million acre feet that arise in the 11 Western States where most of the water comes from and that amounts to about less than one percent of the total."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.328,1460.245,(Inaudible) even the Government would have the nerve to go in and say that because we removed certain property from the public domain and made it a National Forest we intended at the time to reserve enough water to develop shale?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1460.245,1461.494,I think that is right Your Honor.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.878,1470.044,"That may be, that is different."
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1470.044,1474.607,That is a different and that really gets astound to what the Reserved Rights Doctrine is about.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.325,1540.918,"Well Mr. Shapiro let me -- it might help me of my -- you would be here making the same argument I take it even if you had been served as a defendant in a state adjudication prior to beginning of the federal suit and even if you had filed your claims as Eagle said you had to do in that litigation, you would still be here saying you could file in the Federal Court and have the Federal Court adjudicate the three questions that you are about to tell us about?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1540.918,1542.594,With -- well not quite Your Honor.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.039,1558.457,So this is another --
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1558.457,1560.686,"With one exception, I must state the exception."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.686,1561.785,Indian water (Voice Overlap).
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1561.785,1562.084,That is exactly right.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.084,1572.035,You say you have the right that you say that McCarran Act does not reach Indian Rights at all and that the state courts have no jurisdiction whatsoever to adjudicate Indian Water Rights?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1572.035,1583.415,"Or perhaps qualifying it another way even if McCarran waives immunity for Indian Rights it would waive it only in Federal Courts because I suppose -- well McCarran on its face does not restrict itself to state courts, state or federal."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.415,1583.865,"Well, that it is not --"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1583.865,1584.525,But it would not --
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.525,1590.739,That is (Voice Overlap) you do not have any -- you do not have any superior -- you do not have authority for that I guess?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1590.739,1593.89,"What, that it is -- that it would apply to Federal Courts as well?"
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.89,1597.026,"No, that the McCarran Act did not intend to --"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1597.026,1597.956,Reach Indian Rights?
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.956,1598.557,Yes.
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1598.557,1601.16,"Well, I think I do have authority for it."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.536,1608.641,"Well I know, I know but --"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1608.641,1609.898,Let us turn to it now because it is extremely (Voice Overlap).
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.898,1616.048,"But you make it -- you just say that because you got to the Courthouse first, the Federal Court can go ahead?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1616.048,1618.031,That is part of the argument.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.031,1622.106,Yes and even though nothing had happened in the Federal Court of substance?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1622.106,1632.289,"That is right which is not much different than any other plaintiff who has a choice of a forum, Federal or state, who chooses a federal forum."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.289,1632.803,Are we --
1975.74-940,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.803,1639.613,"(Voice Overlap) beyond that proposition is that they not only can, but the Federal Court must proceed?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1639.613,1640.278,That is right.
1975.74-940,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1645.685,1655.783,"We have got close to, but have never really faced up to whether Younger against Harris is going to apply in civil --"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1655.783,1656.504,That is right.
1975.74-940,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1665.037,1666.669,"Quasi criminal, so to speak?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1666.669,1667.247,I beg your pardon?
1975.74-940,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.247,1668.463,"Well, quasi criminal -- (Voice Overlap) quasi criminal --"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1668.463,1669.906,Quasi criminal (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-940,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1669.906,1670.966,-- in which the state was a party?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1670.966,1677.869,"But this is quite different because here is the situation in which you have traditional concurrent jurisdiction, there is no question --"
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.869,1678.056,Yes.
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1688.388,1691.789,"Well, on the face of the statute no preference is declared."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.385,1709.606,Simply a waiver of sovereign immunity?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1709.606,1710.788,Simply a waiver of sovereign immunity.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.091,1715.41,"Well, you have now had been named as a -- in a Federal -- in a state case?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1715.41,1715.786,That is right.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.786,1722.64,You are now party to the adjudication in Water District Number Seven and you have submitted your claims except for your Indian claims?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1722.64,1723.157,No.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.255,1728.895,Only your adjudicative claims under the state?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1728.895,1729.177,No.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.224,1736.551,"Well, why is that?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1736.551,1738.014,Because the Dolores River --
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.014,1742.583,"I know, but why are those the only ones that you submitted?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1742.583,1755.148,"Those are the only ones we have submitted because the Dolores River is geographically separate from the tributaries of the San Juan, which all run through the Indian Reservations."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.681,1773.824,I will confine it to the Dolores then.
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1777.038,1778.607,No.
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.836,1781.269,"Well, did you file them?"
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1784.953,1785.2,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-940,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.2,1785.358,"I see, okay."
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1786.182,1787.087,That is all we brought.
1975.74-940,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1787.087,1789.011,And is that only Indian Reservations?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1789.011,1789.551,No.
1975.74-940,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.551,1789.958,No?
1975.74-940,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1789.958,1796.574,"The Federal claim, the complaint is for all of the tributaries of the San Juan."
1975.74-940,2,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,3080.253,3082.562,If I may Your Honor.
1975.74-940,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3082.562,3084.519,Well try it to be as short as possible.
1975.74-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.519,3099.305,"Mr. Balcomb before you start, I put a question to you that you will answer during your few minutes. If a state property owner should seek a declaratory judgment against the United States on some water question, could such an action be entertained by the Federal Court?"
1975.74-940,2,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,3099.305,3100.494,Declaratory judgment?
1975.74-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.494,3100.8,Yes.
1975.74-940,2,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,3100.8,3101.423,Yes sir.
1975.74-940,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3101.423,3104.05,It could be entertained by the Federal Court?
1975.74-940,2,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,3104.05,3106.431,"I would say yes, sir."
