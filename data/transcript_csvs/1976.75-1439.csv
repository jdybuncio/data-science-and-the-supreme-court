1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.379,"We'll hear arguments next in 1439, Smith against the United States."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,62.619,65.886,Mr. Chief Justice and it may it please the Court.
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,198.688,204.331,"Mr. Smith, you represent not only this defendant but also an amicus here, don't you?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,204.331,204.571,Yes.
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,224.726,227.367,Where you get a one-two punch when you do this.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,227.367,229.939,"Well, that's one of the advantages, yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,229.939,232.814,"Well then you're not really a friend of the Court, are you?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,232.814,236.831,"I am here representing Mr. Jerry Lee Smith, the petitioner here."
1976.75-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,236.831,243.836,"So his -- his law firm represents the amicus curiae, I don't say you can do that."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,243.836,244.533,"Well, Your Honor, I think it would be --"
1976.75-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,244.533,253.075,"I -- I understand amicus curiae to mean that I have no interest in the case itself, but I want to see the Court do the right thing."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,253.075,264.339,"Well, Your Honor, as you will note from the briefs, the amicus brief was prepared by Mr. North and that I had the principal responsibility for preparing --"
1976.75-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,264.339,265.773,Is it the same firm?
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,265.773,267.673,"It is the same law firm, yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,267.673,270.264,"And it's on the brief, it says that."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,270.264,271.023,That's correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,271.023,274.895,Do you -- have you ever seen it before in this Court?
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,274.895,279.93,"I'm not certain that I have ever, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.71,399.314,"Mr. Smith, what if the Iowa legislature by a rather large vote had passed a counterpart of the federal statute and the Governor had signed it, but the Supreme Court of Iowa had held that it violated Iowa's Constitution."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,402.31,431.741,"In that case, I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the situation would be that there had not been as enacted through the governmental structure of Iowa, a statute which expressed the intent of the State Government which gives the repository for the declaration of society's values to have obscenity proscribed within the state."
1976.75-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.755,452.085,"So, then your -- your argument doesn't depend on the fact that a majority of the people in Iowa may not agree with the federal statute?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,452.085,460.621,"That's correct, Your Honor, because a majority of the people within the State of Iowa speak through their elected representatives."
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,460.621,475.324,Suppose that your hypothetical person in that situation took the material which had been declared permissible in Iowa by virtue of the State Supreme Court's action.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,484.179,489.478,"Well, he would not be subject to prosecution of course under the statute here which is the federal mail statute but --"
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,489.478,489.66,"Oh, I'm asking a hypothetical --"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,489.66,490.91,-- he would be engaged --
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.91,491.041,-- question.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,491.041,497.306,He would be taking that material into another state whose community standards would be different.
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,513.085,527.431,"It might be -- be subject to two prosecutions or at least violating two statutes, the statutes of Illinois assuming they had statutes that prohibited this and the federal statutes relating to interstate transportation."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,527.431,528.203,That's correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.334,539.638,"So that the choice of the particular state is binding only on the -- that state, is that not true?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,539.638,541.312,That's correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.794,567.241,"Mr. Tefft, is there any argument about the nature of the materials here?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,569.869,576.403,"Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the phrase “hard core” is something that has no legal meaning."
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,601.798,603.827,Let me put it in another way.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,611.835,628.962,"No, because that is our second argument, Mr. Justice Blackmun, which is that the application of this statute in the circumstances of this case where state law has permitted the conduct, would involve fundamental due process considerations."
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,634.726,636.319,"Well, let me just start all over again."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,644.732,646.577,No.
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,656.196,658.34,As a matter of Iowa law you're saying.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,658.34,664.956,"As a matter of Iowa law and therefore, as a matter of -- and as a matter of federal law."
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,672.746,673.41,By what?
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,673.41,680.408,"By the Court, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.076,740.191,"Yesterday, on a case that was argued involving the intestacy statue of -- statutes of Illinois that -- that exclude the illegitimate children from a father's -- from intrastate succession from a decedent father."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,760.818,770.634,"Well, I would submit, Mr. Justice Stewart that that this is an improper statement, because the remedy for disagreement between the people is the ballot box."
1976.75-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.587,834.657,This -- this is an argument of statutory construction.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,834.657,836.392,That is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.392,847.125,You don't have any doubt that if the Federal Government says the National Labor Relations Act shall apply in all 50 states even though the people of Iowa may not like it.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,849.116,852.217,That is correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,885.562,903.247,"Well now, hasn't Congress in analogous situations when it wanted to exempt the force of federal laws from operation in states where the state policy was otherwise has been explicitly so determined?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,914.756,914.892,Well --
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.892,922.54,"-- at interstate commerce, but hasn't Congress has expressly exempted the mailing of a slot machine from one place to another in Nevada, for example."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,922.54,936.47,"Congress has taken this approach in certain of its more recent statutory enactments, but the decisions that we cite and discussed in our brief do not involve situations where there was an express congressional intent."
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,974.542,981.44,"You -- you Mr. Smith as I understand it, would concede assuming Illinois has a kind of law as described by the Chief Justice."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,993.061,994.77,That is correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,994.77,997.434,So it's not just the intrastate character of this?
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,997.434,1009.621,No the significance as I tried to articulate early of the -- earlier of the intrastate element here is solely that -- only one standard here can possibly be determined to be at issue.
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1022.317,1029.833,"You don't raise any constitutional question but what the Congress could have said, whether or not legal in the state."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1029.833,1037.998,"Well, we do raise and that is our second argument that there are fundamental notice problems in that circumstances."
1976.75-1439,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.837,1058.067,But you wouldn't -- you wouldn't put on any commerce clause argument?
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1058.067,1059.6,No.
1976.75-1439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1114.498,1116.478,Weren't those both dissenting opinions?
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1116.478,1120.781,"Both of those were dissenting opinions, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1157.61,1183.084,"Suppose, Mr. Smith that we had a state which for reason or rather simply decided not to make bank robbery a crime, but the federal statute of course makes it a crime to transfer the proceeds over a state line and it also makes it a federal crime to rob a national bank."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1190.434,1199.795,Not if the federal statute had manifested a clear intent that there were legitimate federal interest that were involved here and were concerned here as with --
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1199.795,1202.929,"Well, doesn't it manifest it just by the passage of it?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1202.929,1218.24,"No, because there is no expression within the statute of any intent and indeed, the nature of the subject matter as recognized by this Court is such, that it's a matter of local concern that there are no national interests here."
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1232.292,1233.769,As a national standard.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1233.769,1234.487,Standard.
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1234.487,1247.802,"Not the -- that's the judgment of the jury in which I expressed the same view that my predecessor, Chief Justice Warren expressed that this is an -- essentially a matter of local community standards."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1247.802,1249.014,That's correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1271.23,1275.623,"Well then this would apply to bank robbery too, that could be your answer to that question."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1275.623,1275.759,Well --
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.759,1291.539,"Unless the -- unless the federal statute made out some sort of a case that there's a special reason why the robbing of national banks, nationally chartered banks is a -- is a bad thing."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1291.539,1315.817,"I think it's somewhat the logic of my position, although I would submit that the differences here are of course that what we're concerned with is further the question of the impact of these rulings on First Amendment rights, the -- the serious notice problems that are involved in applying a federal proscription to conduct which is lawful at state law -- under state law."
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1315.817,1328.913,"Well, I thought your argument -- these 20 arguments was simply that the -- as a matter of definition of the offense, there couldn't be an offense in -- in your state."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1328.913,1329.774,That is correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.774,1336.532,"I mean, whether or not there's been a bank robbery is an objectively identifiable question."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1362.788,1364.665,"I certainly would agree with everything, Mr. Justice Stewart (Voice Overlap) --"
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.665,1366.96,That's make it quite different with the bank robbery case.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1366.96,1367.811,"Yes, it does."
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.811,1369.151,There cannot even be an offense.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1370.407,1385.013,The bank robbery -- robbery situation involves a question of conduct where this -- the issue here that we're concerned with is a question of how do you evaluate the standards in determining what that conduct has been.
1976.75-1439,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.013,1387.943,"Mr. Smith, can I ask you a question?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1423.419,1428.346,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, we would submit that that is a distortion of the Miller decision."
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.034,1462.572,"You take the three part test as a conjunctive test or not a disjunctive test, is it?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1462.572,1462.91,Yes.
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1462.91,1462.941,(Voice Overlap) --
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1462.941,1462.972,That they are --
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1462.972,1463.907,(Voice Overlap) --
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1463.907,1469.619,The three independent elements must conjoin for a finding of obscenity.
1976.75-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.389,1677.393,What about --
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1677.393,1678.643,-- and to criminal imprisonment.
1976.75-1439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.643,1686.357,"What about somebody in Iowa who misbrands drugs in Iowa, the Iowa legislature has chosen not to make that criminally punishable."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1690.397,1700.762,Not in a situation where again the Federal Government has expressly enacted a statute which has its own standards that govern that conduct.
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.762,1709.519,"And also whether or not the misbranding of drugs, the violation itself doesn't depend upon community standards, does it?"
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1709.519,1709.894,No.
1976.75-1439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.985,1718.703,The very essence of this offense as this Court had said depends upon whether or not -- depends upon the standards of the community.
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1718.703,1720.06,That is correct.
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.1,1737.99,"But -- but when a federal jury sitting in Iowa on a federal misbranding case, such as suggested by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, they do as every jury does apply their own standards consistent of course that it is (Inaudible) with the instructions from the Court."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1748.791,1749.988,"Yes, that is true."
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.735,1768.244,"One set of jurors might look at a particular label or brand on drug or -- at some grocery item and say, “No, this is -- this is a not a misbranding."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1781.229,1787.344,"Well, the -- Mr. Chief Justice, there are standards provided in those kinds of statutes."
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.133,1805.036,"Well, I said, “Hopefully, the jury follows the instructions of the Court”, but we know that juries don't always do it."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1805.036,1811.621,But jurors must be required to consider things objectively.
1976.75-1439,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.353,1840.607,"Mr. Smith, are those -- is the definition of the contemporary community standard or the local community standard."
1976.75-1439,0,43301,tefft_w_smith,,1844.306,1859.329,"I think that it is an issue of law in the present circumstances of this case in that, the Iowa legislature has enacted a legal pronouncement on that issue."
1976.75-1439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.334,1866.543,"Mr. Smith, your time has expired."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1868.213,1871.951,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.463,1975.373,"What are the instructions have to say with respect to community standards, are they on the record?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1975.373,1975.653,Yes.
1976.75-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2011.301,2016.826,"Do you recall, Shapiro who the judge was?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2016.826,2018.659,"I regret, Your Honor, I do not."
1976.75-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2018.659,2020.529,The District Judge was Judge Stewart.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2020.529,2021.734,"Mr. Judge Stewart, I think."
1976.75-1439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2021.734,2023.529,"Well, he is an old time Iowa judge."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2028.097,2036.354,"Now, at page 23 -- at the bottom of page 22 and 23 is part of the instruction is quite important."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.48,2088.76,"Mr. Shapiro just to -- to get the same question out, is it your view that the determination of the contemporary community standard is a question of fact or a question of law?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2088.76,2096.71,"Well, the first two elements of the test in Miller, we believe are primarily questions of fact."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.529,2135.928,"Mr. Shapiro, I don't think that quite answers the question."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2152.382,2156.964,I will regard it principally as a question of fact subject to one qualification.
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.568,2205.466,"Mr. Shapiro, I may have missed it."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2212.27,2225.684,The Government relied on the decisions in -- I think it's Paris Adult Theatre and in Hamling that it need not to put on evidence of community standards for a jury to make this determination.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.684,2234.204,What more reliable evidence is there of the mores of community than the -- than the laws of its elective -- elected representatives?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2234.204,2237.707,"Well, let me -- let me illustrate if I may, Your Honor."
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.977,2258.04,"Well, wouldn't we have mores here --"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2258.04,2258.714,-- in the light of community mores --
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.714,2260.792,(Voice Overlap) mores which means --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2260.792,2261.93,Yes.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2261.93,2263.426,-- customs or standards?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2263.426,2263.725,Yes.
1976.75-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2309.855,2320.302,Would you make that same argument if the State of Iowa had decriminalized marijuana or heroine and the federal prosecution?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2320.302,2321.313,"Yes, and we would."
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.441,2346.049,And what -- the very -- whether or not an offense has been committed depends upon community standards --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2346.049,2346.342,Yes.
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.347,2348.075,-- in this particular offense whether or not --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2348.075,2348.077,Well --
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.077,2351.106,-- if they smoked marijuana doesn't depend whatsoever on the community?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2351.106,2358.382,"Whether -- whether it can be constitutionally punished at least, I would -- I would rather express it in that way."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.248,2361.992,"Let me -- may I just interrupt once more, Mr. Shapiro."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2384.899,2388.809,"In the defendant's view, the materials that he offered and the states statute."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.043,2400.561,Is it subject to appellate review or --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2400.561,2400.682,It is subject to appellate --
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.682,2401.848,-- is an issue that --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2401.848,2402.574,It is subject to appellate review --
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.574,2411.535,How does an appellate -- how does an appellate judge can go about reviewing the question of whether or not the correct contemporary community standard was applied?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2411.535,2445.734,"On the first two elements, she gives the greatest weight to the -- to the jury that the constitutional test in Miller as the Court has recognized when it dealt with the question of the geographic scope of standards is essentially factual what the Court said in Miller was that -- under a National Constitution, there can be variation from community to community and then it went on to say -- there aren't fixed national standards of what -- of -- of precisely what appeals to the prurient interest or is patently offensive."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.755,2456.334,I understand but are they questions of fact that can be decided without any evidence being in the record to tell us what the standard is in Iowa.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2459.421,2459.729,I understand.
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.729,2467.44,"That we may not look -- we -- we may not look to the Iowa law and we don't have to accept the defendants of them, so what do we look at to see what the standard is?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2467.44,2470.737,If you look at the jury's determination because this is the aspect of the issue (Voice Overlap) --
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.737,2476.837,"(Voice Overlap) to determine this on the basis of their own knowledge of what happens in the community, which is not in the record for us to review, is it right?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2476.837,2481.296,That is -- that is the basis of the test as it has been defined in the Court's decision.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.296,2486.889,Well now you -- you've told us that the Iowa law was admissible and evident?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2486.889,2487.269,Yes.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2487.269,2488.309,Why?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2489.166,2509.453,So that the jury may consider since the jury is permitted to consider any evidence -- any relevant evidence relating to what constitutes the community's standard with respect to what appeals to the prurient interest or what is patently offensive and that the statute could be considered by them.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2510.557,2523.444,"In a federal prosecution for possession of marijuana, would it be -- would the absence of a state criminal law -- criminalizing the possession of marijuana be admissible and evident?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2523.444,2525.387,"No, Your Honor, it would not and it --"
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.387,2526.702,What's the difference?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2526.702,2549.582,"Well, I think the difference is that the state statute here dealing with the criminal -- the decision to criminalize or not criminalize obscenity would to some effect, would to some extent reflect community mores but the weight to be given to that is for the jury."
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2598.737,2605.859,"Isn't -- you said the basic question was whether this material is or is not obscene, “obscene”."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2605.859,2607.064,Within the meaning of the federal statute?
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.064,2608.448,Within a meaning of the federal statute.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2608.448,2609.371,That's correct.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2609.371,2625.103,"And hasn't it been determined that whether or not material is obscene, it depends at least -- it depends among other things upon whether or not it offends community standards --"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2625.103,2626.592,Yes.
1976.75-1439,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.743,2634.417,"And if -- and if the community has said through its elected representatives that it does offend our community standards, isn't that the end of it?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2634.417,2636.12,But the Iowa statute doesn't say that.
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.658,2652.906,What -- is it true that your position is that the case matter is obscene or not dependent solely upon the whims of 12 people?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2652.906,2652.91,No.
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2652.91,2657.777,"And I -- and I emphasize solely, isn't that your position?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2657.777,2660.551,"No, Your Honor, it is that 12 people applying the instructions (Voice Overlap) --"
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2660.551,2663.145,"Mr. Shapiro, maybe I'm wrong."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2672.831,2675.46,"Under this Court's decisions, there is guidance."
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2687.277,2687.988,"Well, you did --"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2687.988,2689.197,There are limits on the --
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.197,2698.832,Did you put on anybody who have said that there is a single -- there's at least one person in Iowa who does not like obscenity?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2698.832,2702.817,"That, I don't think is the issue, when one likes obscenity or not --"
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.817,2704.455,"Well, it's a community standard --"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2704.455,2706.638,"It's a community standard which goes, does this material --"
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.638,2709.928,What is -- what is the community standard now in Iowa?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2709.928,2722.539,"Well, I think the community standard in Iowa is reflected on this jury's determination is that hard core pornography can be recognized as a material which to the average person appeals to the prurient interest --"
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.539,2722.892,And then reflects --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2722.892,2724.164,-- and which is patently offensive --
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.164,2724.958,The next jury could say --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2724.958,2726.858,-- in its depiction of explicit sex.
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2726.858,2729.779,The next jury can amend that law and change it.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2729.779,2732.487,There is a possibility of inconsistent jury verdicts --
1976.75-1439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.487,2733.638,Of changing the law.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2733.638,2736.03,There is a possibility of inconsistent jury verdicts.
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.209,2744.435,"Mr. Shapiro, what the -- what law did the -- was introduced before the jury?"
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2744.435,2746.723,The statue appears in the record.
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.723,2749.743,Is that -- is that the statute at page 47 of the appendix?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2749.743,2750.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.552,2751.951,In -- in its entirety?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2751.951,2753.543,In its -- I believe that is the insight.
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.543,2757.064,With this definition of “obscene material”?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2757.064,2760.75,"Yes, that's the -- that is the statue in its entirety."
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.167,2763.284,"I understand, I understand."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2763.284,2764.392,Recently to exclude --
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.392,2764.962,But this says right here --
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2764.962,2764.967,-- the matter --
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2764.967,2775.329,-- that it defined obscene material and then just made -- made it -- and made it criminal only in the case it's just delivered or displayed to minors.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2775.329,2776.442,That is correct.
1976.75-1439,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.442,2779.611,But the definition of obscene material is in the statute?
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2779.611,2783.774,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.714,2998.825,"Mr. Shapiro, I'll make this question of vagueness and perhaps the allied argument of overbreadth."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3016.101,3019.502,"Yes, I think you do Your Honor."
1976.75-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.689,3043.642,We'll resume there at one o'clock Mr. Shapiro.
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3046.289,3049.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.318,3253.653,"Mr. Shapiro, let me ask this one other question, it has been on my mind."
1976.75-1439,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3267.904,3286.861,"Well, of course the -- since it is a criminal case -- there's always a burden of persuasion on the government to establish beyond the reasonable doubt that the material involved defense community standards within the Miller test."
1976.75-1439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3418.274,3419.147,Thank you gentlemen.
