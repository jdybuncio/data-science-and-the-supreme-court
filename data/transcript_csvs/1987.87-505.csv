1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.438,"We'll hear argument first this afternoon in No. 87-505, Chick Cam Choo v. Exxon Corporation."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,11.079,14.472,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court:"
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.436,224.377,"It was decided that Singapore law would apply, though wasn't it?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,224.377,230.5,"It was decided that American law would not apply, and the court's discussion of that indicated that it felt Singapore law should apply."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.5,236.975,Wasn't there in the attempted state action a claim under state law filed?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,236.975,241.029,"There was a contention under state law, the state wrongful death act."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.029,245.201,"Do you concede that that, at least, could be enjoined?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,245.201,249.004,"No, Your Honor, I don't because--"
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.004,249.474,Why not?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,250.646,256.12,"--It was dismissed under forum non conveniens, that state law."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.12,263.484,But the necessary predicate of that forum non conveniens decision was the determination that the governing substantive law was not the law of the United States.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,263.484,265.773,Was not that a federal maritime law?
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.773,266.434,Just federal?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,266.434,267.916,Just federal.
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.551,277.684,Didn't they say that Singapore law governed?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,277.684,285.098,"The court indicated that American federal maritime law did not apply, and in so-doing indicated that it felt like the foreign law would apply."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.749,289.319,It did say that foreign law applied?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,289.319,291.832,--That is the essence of the decision.
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.832,299.126,"If that's the essence of the decision, why can't they enjoin the bringing of an action under the law of any of the United States?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,299.126,308.832,"Well, because we're getting into the forum non conveniens issue as it relates to choice of law, and really what we have here is a forum non conveniens issue and not choice of law."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.479,320.921,I'm not talking about that now.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,335.16,357.155,"I would next concede that Defendants, or the Respondents in the state court action contend that that was collateral estoppel or directly estopped by the determination by the federal court, the first federal court, that Singapore law applied; and by implicitly rejecting the state law claim."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.155,369.183,"And if that's so, the federal court could, if the other requirements of the discretionary judgment are met, could enjoin the bringing of that claim that is already determined by the federal court?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,369.183,369.562,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.927,432.763,"I suppose you are saying that, if there is an estoppel, that claim should be first made in the state court?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,432.763,434.604,That's one thing.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.604,446.031,"--Wouldn't you think, if the issue has been decided in the federal... if Singapore law applies, certainly Texas can't apply it's wrongful death statute?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,446.031,448.933,That would be true.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.933,453.578,"All right, so when the federal claims were dismissed in the state court, and you didn't complain about that."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,453.578,457.291,The federal claims were dismissed; that was appealed but we lost.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.291,459.912,So that just leaves the Texas claim.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,459.912,461.933,"And the foreign law claims, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.267,480.376,"Well, in any event, the defendants in the Texas courts could claim collateral estoppel?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,480.376,482.907,I think there is no question they could claim it.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.907,484.707,Would they win?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,484.707,501.23,"I would have to say that on the basis of the fact that the federal court, if the federal court decision is that clear... and I do not think it is that clear, Justice Scalia... there is no question there is intimations in that federal court judgment to the effect that they believe Singapore law should apply, and not American."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.23,510.863,"All right, so if the Texas courts rejected that collateral estoppel claim, it would come on up through the state courts and could get here?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,510.863,511.795,"That's right, Justice White."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.456,517.419,"You think the estoppel claim should win in the state court, if it was made?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,517.419,530.739,"--Knowing the background of this case in this particular case, I do not think it should win because the court did not directly address that issue, even though, as I conceded to Justice Scalia, the first federal court did not say"
1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.896,552.04,But you say whether the collateral estoppel claim would win or lose would not be the basis for an injunction under the Anti-Injunction Act?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,552.04,552.661,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.798,587.574,Why didn't you object to the dismissal of the federal claims?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,587.574,588.896,"Well, we did."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.617,590.088,"Well, I know."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,597.651,600.072,"I don't agree with it, but it based the law."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.113,610.641,If the federal court dismissed them because there wasn't any... couldn't be a federal claim if Singapore law applied?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,610.641,612.051,That's true if federal--
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.051,617.614,It's like a motion... you dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,617.614,619.905,"--That could be construed, under Romero."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.792,636.687,And you don't think that would be... you think you can retry that out in a state court?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,636.687,643.312,"Well, the reason it couldn't be a complete... they didn't solve all the problems, Justice, we had the other claims there."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.312,645.423,"I know, but how about the federal claims?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,656.399,658.661,"Your Honor, I submit that they could not."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.809,671.57,Just like they would be on the state claims?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,671.57,678.845,"Well, Your Honor, I would disagree on the state claim, there is a considerably more serious question there I concede because it was plead."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.163,701.52,"Mr. Musslewhite, is it clear that the federal decision was not a decision on the merits with regard to the state claim and the federal law claim?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,701.52,705.633,It was a decision on the merits with regard to the federal law claim.
1987.87-505,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,710.917,715.939,"Why isn't the decision that there is no claim under Texas law, if they made that?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,721.652,724.975,Because it's a decision on the grounds of forum non conveniens.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.657,881.086,"What do you mean by ""pre-emption""?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,881.086,902.17,"Well, the Respondents have contended, Justice White, that they concede there is a difference between the federal forum non conveniens law and the state forum non conveniens law, but that the reason that an injunction can issue is because the federal forum non conveniens law, such as the maritime case, pre-empts the state forum non conveniens law."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.942,908.175,So you think that... is that different than talking about estoppel?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,911.297,914.429,"--It's different, yes sir, it is."
1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.095,1123.598,"But don't you read Judge Gee's opinion... which I realize you are challenging, as saying that in maritime cases such as this, a state doesn't have the latitude that it might have in an FELA case, to have its own forum non conveniens doctrine?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1123.598,1144.092,"Well Your Honor, I go right to Justice O'Connor's opinion in Talentire, and you talk about the savings to suitor clause, and I just do not believe and see that there is any way that there can be a pre-emption under uniformity or whatever, a reverse-Erie, of a forum non conveniens determination."
1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.597,1244.898,Those are two both different points.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1244.898,1245.569,I understand.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.309,1290.867,"But I thought that one of the elements in forum non conveniens adjudication as Judge Gee said, is what law applies?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1290.867,1295.621,"It is a factor, and this Court stated in Piper v. Reyno that it's a factor."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.621,1304.386,"And accordingly, the federal court certainly held that United States law didn't apply."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1315.103,1317.384,"I think it probably will be, Justice White."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.408,1334.157,"I know, but I'm talking to your claim that forum non conveniens just isn't one of those doctrines that can be a subject to pre-emption or preclusion or whatever you want to call it."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1345.002,1347.585,--You probably can't.
1987.87-505,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1359.113,1361.354,"What is the state law claim, is it a wrongful death claim?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1361.354,1364.686,"The state law claim is the wrongful death claim, Justice Brennan."
1987.87-505,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.686,1367.639,"And if you could proceed with it, what law would apply?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1367.639,1373.162,"Well, if we could proceed with the state law wrongful death claim, the Texas state law would apply."
1987.87-505,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1381.099,1382.808,Then you'd have to prove what laws?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1382.808,1389.764,"--Then we would come in and try the case under Singapore law in the Texas state court, and the statute persists--"
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.764,1392.836,Under the Texas wrongful death statute?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1392.836,1395.096,--It's a statute adjunct to the law.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.096,1400.65,"I know, but it wouldn't be... your Texas wrongful death claim would be kaput."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1401.932,1402.573,Yes.
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.741,1420.466,So you would try to make a wrongful death claim under foreign law?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1420.466,1423.266,--That's one thing we'd feel comfortable--
1987.87-505,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1423.266,1424.475,"You'd have to plead it, would you not?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1424.475,1425.847,--Justice--
1987.87-505,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1425.847,1429.969,Would you not have to plead the wrongful death under Singapore law?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1429.969,1430.94,--We did plead it in state court.
1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.94,1436.784,Where did this accident take place and where do the Plaintiffs reside?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1436.784,1464.691,"The plaintiff is from Singapore and the accident took place in the harbor of Singapore where an American traditional blue-water vessel was there temporarily; at least it was owned by an American company through another company; and the Exxon Corporation; and it was there temporarily for repairs and Plaintiff, the decedent, was on this vessel to assist in repairs and was killed when a spindle fell through the deck onto his head."
1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.691,1469.606,"Texas really means what it says when it says ""open courts"", then, doesn't it?"
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1544.453,1545.795,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.795,1555.372,Even though you're not seeking to overturn the federal decision in the latter case; you're just trying to relitigate one fact.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1580.608,1586.371,"That would, in my opinion, would have been a decision on the merits of the case and it could be."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.371,1587.433,It could be.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1608.267,1610.768,"But that's just it, Justice Scalia, it was not fully litigated."
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.58,1631.782,Whether Texas law applies was fully-litigated.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1634.323,1636.734,"Assuming that is correct as you stated, and I--"
1987.87-505,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.734,1637.325,"Yes, yes."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1638.106,1640.157,"--proceed in arguendo, then it would have been fully litigated."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.658,1660.26,It would win on the foreign law claim anyway in the Texas court no matter what.
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1660.26,1664.884,"--I believe so, Your Honor, but I concede that it was not an issue determined in the--"
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.884,1677.392,You concede that the state law claim would probably couldn't go forward if the federal court decision was pleaded in the state court?
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1677.392,1681.053,--The reason I have some problems with an answer yes--
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1681.053,1683.224,If it was pleaded in the--
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1683.224,1689.181,"--state court, but our position would be that the court did not directly address that issue."
1987.87-505,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.426,1710.812,"--You would say, though, even if that issue of the applicable law was clearly adjudicated, you would say that no injunction could issue; that you would have to plead it in the state court."
1987.87-505,0,17864,benton_musslewhite,,1710.812,1713.424,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1987.87-505,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.557,1732.128,"Thank you, Mr. Musslewhite."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1733.938,1737.521,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.482,1802.553,What about the foreign law claim?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1802.553,1809.639,"I think the foreign law claim... it's difficult to see how the foreign law claim comes up, and certainly not in the context that Mr. Musslewhite suggests."
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.639,1814.381,"I know, but didn't they plead a claim under foreign law in the state court?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1814.381,1818.004,They claim under foreign law in the Texas wrongful death statute.
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.004,1858.77,So you claim the foreign law claim was just plead as a part of the Texas wrongful death?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1858.77,1863.963,"It is part of a Texas wrongful death claim, yes, Your Honor, because that was the statute that was invoked here."
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.963,1867.045,It didn't claim a right to recover under Singapore law?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1867.045,1872.239,"They claimed a right, but as I understand it, the right claimed was a part of--"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.239,1882.094,"Let's assume it appeared in the complaint as a separate count, as a claim for damages of some sort under Singapore law."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1884.636,1888.028,"--That claim is alive, and that claim is subject to be adjudicated--"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.028,1889.03,And it was not foreclosed by the federal--
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1889.03,1890.299,--Absolutely not.
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.185,1896.247,--So it's alive?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1896.247,1897.526,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.108,1904.771,I thought the injunction just forbade the Texas court going ahead at all?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1904.771,1905.853,--Going ahead at all.
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.456,1963.86,"Well, but did the federal court decide that law you just described?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1963.86,1965.119,"I believe that it did, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.87,1981.862,"Well, it didn't even say that in so many words, did it?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,1993.86,1998.662,"--I think it goes on to discuss, Your Honor, the fact that it appears to be controlled by the law of Singapore."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1998.662,2000.455,I don't find that.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2000.455,2002.205,"I believe that it's in there, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.998,2009.599,"It says there are remedies available in the courts, in the Singapore courts."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2009.599,2011.291,"--Yes, and that was proved up in the district courts."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.291,2013.422,What is the statute of limitations in Singapore?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2013.422,2024.939,"As it now stands, Your Honor, I am advised... I don't know for a fact, that they have expired, principally because no litigation was commenced in Singapore in 1980 or 1981."
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.491,2123.074,Federal court opinion didn't cite any of these cases.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2125.705,2131.579,"Your Honor, it did cite Lauritzen, and Lauritzen was clearly briefed."
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.579,2138.184,Did it decide this particular legal issue that you are now asking us to decide?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2138.184,2162.618,"I believe that it was at the genesis of this development, Your Honor, and let me put it this way: clearly the argument... in fact, at this time, there were cases on the books, and this determination in the district court can be interpreted to mean simply that once you made the Lauritzen... Rhoditis determination of choice of law, if it was not U.S. law, forum non conveniens automatically followed."
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.632,2173.346,At this stage I am really less interested in whether it really follows.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2186.595,2190.438,The issue was presented to the federal court in that fashion.
1987.87-505,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2223.28,2238.219,"Mr. Cooney, to repeat, you say that you argued to the district court that federal forum non conveniens determinations pre-empted state forum non conveniens determinations?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2238.219,2238.88,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that."
1987.87-505,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2242.162,2247.886,You didn't argue that; you just argued a traditional forum non conveniens argument?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2247.886,2252.799,Under the maritime concept of forum non conveniens as it was then developing.
1987.87-505,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2252.799,2256.391,So the pre-emption issue really hasn't been litigated?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2256.391,2258.121,"I believe that it has, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2327.438,2342.887,"You go back to Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Richmond, which Atlantic Coast Line reaffirms, and you have a flat case where the claim was the state court has no business in this area because these kinds of suits are pre-empted by the NLRA, and this Court said,"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2345.828,2346.95,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.092,2348.87,Then why is this case different?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2348.87,2355.025,"--A judgment: a judgment saying this case should be dismissed for forum non conveniens, and that is the very crux of the issue."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.138,2377.21,"You also said ""without prejudice""?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2382.663,2389.278,"I think they had to say ""without prejudice"", Your Honor, because without doing that there would be nothing left to try in Singapore."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.78,2392.491,They could have said that.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2394.141,2395.072,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.297,2409.952,Why would a federal court have any business in a forum non conveniens motion before it saying that a state court has no jurisdiction to try this?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2409.952,2429.013,"Depending on what kind of forum non conveniens determination we're making, Your Honor, following Gulf v. Gilbert, Congress passed 1404A, so that virtually any indigenous domestic forum non conveniens determination in the federal courts is now made on the basis of the transfer statute."
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.816,2481.807,"Mr. Cooney, I don't think you're answering the Chief Justice's question."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2522.706,2528.858,"Your Honor, I think it depends on the facts in the case and what we're trying to do with forum non conveniens."
1987.87-505,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.923,2564.591,It might have said that.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2573.407,2582.633,"I think that it again depending upon what policy the court was addressing, it is in fact necessary, and perhaps logically necessary."
1987.87-505,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.764,2624.862,"That suggests a forum non conveniens that is kind of almost a constitutional type thing, not just a doctrine of convenience as among federal courts."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2624.862,2628.435,"--Your Honor, I would suggest that we're approaching that."
1987.87-505,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.891,2664.198,"Could I walk in... could I, as a defendant, walk into federal court and make a motion where the plaintiffs have filed action saying"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2676.855,2687.242,"--Well, in fact, in the Zipfel case, as I understand it, that's about what happened, Your Honor, when they got their forum non conveniens dismissal, because there was already a state action pending in Texas."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.029,2743.299,I just have great difficulty seeing jurisdiction in the federal court decide what a state court can do on forum non conveniens?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2743.299,2744.18,"Well, Your Honor--"
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2744.18,2749.544,I don't think forum non conveniens can apply to any but that court.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2761.241,2765.433,"--I would respectfully disagree on that on two grounds, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.194,2769.235,Straighten me out.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2769.235,2781.023,"--in this context a state court handling a maritime matter is acting pursuant to a savings to suitors clause, and is therefore bound by what has been referred to as the ""reverse-Erie"" doctrine or the 'uniformity ""doctrine""."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2789.869,2791.64,And this would be binding on the state court?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2791.64,2792.381,--That's right.
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.381,2797.275,By what jurisdiction... what statute... does that happen on?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2797.843,2807.13,"It happens in this sense, Your Honor, and only in this sense: admittedly forum non conveniens is a discretionary tool; the district judge does not have to grant it."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2807.13,2812.214,To protect its jurisdiction... and not somebody else's?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2815.655,2818.266,"No, I'm not after protecting the jurisdiction, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2819.538,2822.33,You want to protect the state court's jurisdiction.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2827.122,2839.061,"--All I can say, Your Honor, that if a dismissal from a federal court contemplating further litigation in a foreign country is not binding on the state courts, at least in the maritime situation."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2850.507,2851.459,It's a matter of necessity.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2854.42,2859.323,"Not completely that, because I think there are good policy grounds for doing this."
1987.87-505,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2859.323,2861.106,That the state court can't protect itself?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2861.106,2865.169,"The state court in this instance, Your Honor, is a maritime court."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.636,2963.112,"May I ask, Mr. Cooney, supposing a federal court had said there are a lot of factors that one looks at in your forum non conveniens determination, one of which is the law to apply."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2987.377,2988.439,I doubt I would unless--
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.439,2993.302,Your argument depends entirely on the fact that there was a determination on the choice of law issue?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,2993.302,2994.043,--No.
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.326,3032.658,I'm still a little puzzled.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3039.852,3041.624,If the federal court completely--
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.624,3052.62,"Say it says that American maritime law applies, or it's the same as Singapore law, but all these other factors support a determination that--"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3052.62,3053.833,"--I don't think I have the same case, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.833,3056.514,"--I know you wouldn't have the same case, but would you have any case at all?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3056.514,3057.433,I don't think so.
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.614,3061.526,"So your case does, then, rest entirely on the choice of law point?"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3061.526,3066.028,--I would disagree that it's entirely on the choice of law point.
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.162,3088.154,Why is it that you say a Texas court could not say
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3096.969,3104.864,"Your Honor, I think that they can, and that's another question."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.494,3121.547,The federal court determination is controlling in the case.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3121.547,3122.248,It's binding.
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.856,3125.007,"Well, then why can't Texas say,"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3130.253,3147.212,"--You see, I go one step further, Your Honor, and say that the forum non conveniens dismissal, once it has been made, is also binding on the state court because the state court has a savings to suitors maritime court is bound to apply the same law as the federal court."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.212,3148.833,Which is Singapore law.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3149.794,3152.245,"No, not the forum non conveniens law, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.488,3165.324,--You're saying that because it's a maritime case the Texas court must apply precisely the same analysis that the federal court does in its forum non conveniens analysis?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3165.324,3173.62,"It must frame the issues under federal law as would be framed, and he must apply the same criteria... clearly it's discretionary."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.154,3201.938,Is the question whether an estoppel by judgment has arisen a question of federal law or a question of state law?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3201.938,3204.93,In this instance it's a question of federal law.
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.585,3214.747,What is your authority for that?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3214.747,3230.707,"--I think generally, Your Honor, courts have the power, and I think there is a case in my brief though it does not come to mind immediately, that has the power to determine the effect of their own judgment, and that's kind of an inherent power of the court."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.713,3253.072,"I understand the determining the effect of its own judgment, but that freely is analytically different from the second court determining whether or not that judgment must be given res judicata or collateral estoppel affecting its court, and that's what--"
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3253.072,3265.77,"That becomes the uniformity question, Your Honor, and that gets, I guess to the nub of this case, and that is whether the federal forum non conveniens law as a rule of decision is binding upon the state courts under the uniformity doctrine?"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.004,3299.331,--I still can't get through my mind why you think the claim stated in the state court based on Singapore law would not go forward in that court?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3299.331,3303.784,Absent the forum non conveniens determination?
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.784,3304.485,"No, no."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3305.584,3313.181,"Okay, well then, my answer simply is that the forum non conveniens determination is binding on the state court, and it is not--"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.181,3314.581,Why is it binding on the state court?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3314.581,3318.374,--Because its maritime law is binding on the state court.
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.374,3320.225,So that's a pre-emption?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3321.246,3323.617,"No, it's a uniformity question, Your Honor."
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.613,3334.646,--So you're saying that it's just a reverse Erie?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3338.937,3342.129,"--Yes, and I think--"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.129,3347.723,And it's a substantive rule under maritime law?
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3347.723,3362.673,"--It's a substantive... yes, Your Honor, because if my analysis of what maritime forum non conveniens is, it fully adjudicates the case in the United States, subject to the conditional retention of the case, should it not go forward in the foreign forum."
1987.87-505,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3362.673,3370.518,"Yes, but now you're arguing that the determination on the choice of law issue isn't all that important, and you gave me the exact opposite answer earlier."
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3370.518,3376.001,"The choice of law argument, Your Honor, is a constituent... it's a difficult situation."
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.617,3404.191,Judge Clark thought that this was a pre-emption issue.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3413.567,3421.411,"I think that both Judge Gee and Judge Clark's use of the word, ""pre-emption"" has been very unfortunate, and I regret it."
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3421.411,3422.212,I would think so.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3422.212,3426.273,"It has given everyone an opportunity to focus on pre-emption, because--"
1987.87-505,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.273,3428.626,And to rely on Atlantic Coast Lines.
1987.87-505,1,29780,james_patrick_cooney,,3428.626,3430.027,--And I don't think this is a pre-emption case.
