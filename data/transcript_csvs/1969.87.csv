1969.87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.211,"Number 87, the United States against Kordel and others."
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,17.35,20.943,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.354,866.614,Was there any room to pierce a corporate veil in the Fifth Amendment cases?
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,866.614,872.804,"Well, I think that that was the issue in Campbell Painting Corporation against Reid."
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.078,889.356,"Well, it may or may not have been there, but would it ever be?"
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,889.356,902.782,It would be a departure from the holding that we've had consistently that non-personal entities do not enjoy a privilege against self-incrimination.
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.782,916.439,Would there be in your view a violation of Fifth Amendment if these people had not been doing business in the corporate form but as a partnership and the same thing happened?
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,916.439,924.196,"Well, they certainly could have claimed the privilege against self-incrimination as individuals, even though they were doing business as a partnership."
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.196,925.203,Yes.
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,925.203,925.36,And --
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.36,939.918,"So assume a civil action started, interrogatories to the parties and the strap was that if they can't answer them, their property would be forfeited, compulsion?"
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,939.918,944.654,"Now, that that's always a possible sanction under the civil rules."
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.654,945.268,That would be --
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,945.268,951.825,They could have claimed the privilege against self-incrimination providing it was adequately founded as to particular questions.
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.825,952.37,But wouldn't the --
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,952.37,954.862,Just as respondent Feldten could have claimed in this case.
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.986,956.11,Wouldn't -- in order to --
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,956.11,957.909,As to resolve the answering.
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.909,968.515,"Even then that the compulsion, wouldn't that have to be that the forfeiture would occur as a result of a failure answers interrogatories rather than the strengths of the Government's case in the civil suit?"
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,968.515,970.2,"Well, that is true."
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.826,979.771,Because I think not automatic at all?
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,979.771,980.759,Compulsion.
1969.87,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.759,984.886,"That is not automatic at all, but you lose your suit because you refuse to answer?"
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,984.886,993.138,It's certainly is not especially if you have a well founded claim of privilege as the basis for your refusal.
1969.87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.138,1007.199,"I suppose many civil cases have been lost because of the disinclination of the defendant in the civil case answer some question which might incriminate him, is that not so?"
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1007.199,1011.448,To the best of my belief it is so.
1969.87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1029.416,1046.45,"It could easily happen in a tax, civil tax case, that a defendant might assert the Fifth Amendment that he would take the risk of jeopardizing his case possibly by doing so and he might suffer the consequence."
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1046.45,1049.059,That is correct Your Honor.
1969.87,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1049.195,1053.421,"It is actually corporation was the -- well, it's a libel -- the things were in effect --"
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1053.421,1058.069,"It was an in rem proceeding, the corporation being the claimant was the other party."
1969.87,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.069,1061.431,Corporation was a claimant and the --
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1061.431,1089.575,We have also addressed our brief to the broader concern which seems to underlie the decision of the Court of Appeals the question of fairness in the administration by Government agencies in this and other fields of their responsibilities under statutes which provide for the possibility of both civil and criminal remedies against defending corporations or individuals.
1969.87,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1336.54,1340.671,Was that notice of the criminal proceedings required by the statute or was it?
1969.87,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1340.671,1348.752,"It is required by the statute in Section 335, Title 21 Your Honor."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1726.017,1730.617,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1772.021,1779.283,"Do you rely on any statutory prohibition against, what you call unfair?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1779.283,1781.198,"Your Honor, yes I do."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1799.982,1805.236,I thought you -- didn't the Court below decide this on the question of Constitution?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1805.236,1809.409,They decided -- it would appear that they decided that the question on two grounds.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1841.658,1845.156,Are you relying on the constitutional point or the other or both?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1845.156,1847.038,Both -- both Your Honor.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1847.709,1855.513,And your idea is that that something in Court thinks is unfair is prohibited by law?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1855.513,1868.951,I would say it's a violative of constitutional due process and also comes within the authority of this Court to supervise with fair administration of criminal justice other than McNab Rule.
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1869.375,1889.629,"Now, let me while we have you stopped for the moment Mr. Friend, suppose you've tried the civil case, in the civil case instead of eliciting these answers by discovery, the same answers were -- the same questions were put to the individual officers here involved."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1889.629,1890.43,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.43,1902.974,Would they not at that time have had the choice to decline to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds or answer as they did?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1902.974,1911.864,"I think Your Honor the answer to that question is that at that point, they would have been a choice which they could make."
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.062,1949.092,"Well, how is that different from having a question, refusal made in the Court room sitting on the witness chair, other than on Fifth Amendment grounds and then having a order from the Court directing him to answer the question?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1949.092,1971.538,"Mr. Chief Justice, in all of the cases that I've found on this, what has happened in the usual case and in almost every case is that the civil Court will stay the trial of that case pending the outcome of the criminal case if in fact the criminal case is either pending or eminent."
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1972.066,1974.834,But what if it's neither?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1974.834,1995.469,"There are cases would say that if it's neither, if the Government does not have under contemplation of bringing of a criminal case, then there are cases which say that while the defendant must answer the question the civil case in the interests of fairness and to avoid abuse, the Government may not use those answers in the criminal case."
1969.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.469,1999.498,Let's assuming if it gets to background of the Fifth Amendment problem?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,1999.498,1999.804,No.
1969.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2127.82,2137.113,Whether this is a really an argument that to the extent that there maybe discovery in a criminal prosecution.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2145.869,2148.164,That would be opposition Mr. Justice Brennan.
1969.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.989,2158.336,"What would you say though, if the interrogatories here had not been signed by either one of these two men but had been signed by some other officer of the corporation?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2158.336,2171.24,"Our position would be that if the Government had at that time a pending criminal proceeding, they should not seek to elicit through the use of interrogatories in a case which is identical to the criminal case."
1969.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.334,2179.877,Oh I know that.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2195.308,2198.896,"Well, I would agree with Your Honor that they could under the White case and --"
1969.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.896,2208.639,"Well, alright that they were getting no more, putting the Fifth Amendment aside, they were giving no more by getting corporate evidence then they could get in the criminal case?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2208.639,2232.325,"Well, I most respectfully disagree with that suggestion Mr. Justice White because even the District Court felt and the Court of Appeals made express findings with respect to this point that what they sought was not corporate documents, but what they sought was admissions concerning activities of Kordel."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2261.284,2263.449,Who answered?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2263.449,2266.362,"The other defendant in this case, Mr. Feldten."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2266.362,2267.291,Kordel answer?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2267.291,2282.079,"Kordel -- Kordel did not sign the interrogatories but the Court of Appeals says, that he undoubtedly and definitely participated in the decision to answer the questions which they were required to do after the Court have order them to answer the question."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2282.079,2286.487,Did he claim any immunity on the ground of the Fifth Amendment?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2286.487,2304.827,"Mr. Justice Black, when the motion for protective order was made before the District Court in a civil case, while they did not plea the Fifth Amendment, the motion for the protective order clearly spelled out the dilemma which confronted the two officers of the corporation."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2304.827,2307.282,Did they claim immunity?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2307.282,2307.43,That --
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2307.43,2308.732,Under the Fifth Amendment?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2308.732,2311.846,They did not claim the Fifth Amendment.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2319.948,2321.692,"Then didn't claim it, did they?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2321.692,2330.288,"Well, I would say they did not claim it in the technical sense, but I would not suggest that constituted a waive of --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2330.288,2331.191,I understand it.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2331.191,2331.27,Yes.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2331.27,2332.399,I understand that.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2332.399,2332.664,Yes.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2332.664,2335.337,"That's why I was asking to follow, did they claim it?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2335.337,2346.661,"They didn't claim specifically, but their failure to have claimed that in my judgment would not be deemed the waiver because of the form in which they did ask to be excused from answering the questions."
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2347.516,2348.995,Let me ask you a question.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2373.672,2382.121,I would not make that argument under those facts Your Honor and I do not believe that that would -- those facts would have moved the Court of Appeals to reverse.
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.121,2392.542,But then does the constitutional question you're arguing depend upon the motivation of the prosecutor in pressing the civil case first?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2392.542,2402.729,"Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe a pursuit of the motive or the good faith or the lack of good faith is a fruitful inquiry for this reason."
1969.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2495.599,2497.246,"Mr. Friend, may I just add?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2497.246,2497.347,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1969.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2497.347,2510.918,"Suppose there's been no proceeding against the individuals either the civil case or in the criminal case, but the defendant in each, the civil case or in the criminal case, but the defendant in each, the civil and the criminal case had been the corporation only, would you be making the same argument?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2510.918,2513.768,"Your Honor, the corporation was a defendant in both --"
1969.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2513.768,2522.218,"I know it was, but then -- along with the individuals, but suppose it was a sole defendant in the civil case and the sole defendant in the criminal case?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2522.218,2533.254,"Sir, I would not make the argument on Fifth Amendment grounds but I would make the argument on the McNab or under reasonable and fair administrative procedures indeed --"
1969.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2533.254,2534.407,"And under the rules, I guess?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2534.407,2535.186,And under rules.
1969.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.391,2541.178,You think in that the Court of Appeals was wrong in affirming the judgment against the corporation?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2541.178,2554.71,"The Court of Appeals -- I do as a matter of fact, I have a petition for rehearing of that denial the petition for certiorari as to the corporation which was filed in June and which is still pending before the Court."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2585.4,2588.854,We have to decide this on basis perhaps.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2592.933,2593.291,Yes.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2593.291,2594.495,All of it.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2599.587,2626.286,"Well, I don't know Mr. Justice Black, if I could slaughter into anyone of those categories, but I think I would rely upon the principle that was stated in US against Boyd, that no Court should decree a discovery which will tend to convict a person or corporation of a crime."
1969.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2626.286,2627.743,But that was a Fifth Amendment?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2627.743,2628.735,"But Mr. Justice Brennan, --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2628.735,2632.906,"And by motivation of fairness as my brother says, that's Fifth Amendment?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2632.906,2644.39,"As I read Boyd, Mr. Justice Brennan, the holding of Boyd or the language in Boyd is somewhat broader than the Fourth or Fifth Amendment."
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2652.269,2675.964,"But did not -- but did not this Court in the Boyd case emphasized with great particularity that it was private papers, private papers that were being seized and cited a British Judge from a couple of 100 years before that man's private papers are among his most -- that his dearest possession, some language of that kind."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2678.371,2682.423,"Mr. Chief Justice, the case did deal with private papers."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2742.84,2743.465,What?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2743.465,2755.224,-- whether the methods employed in obtaining such an information show such unfairness that the evidence should be inadmissible apart from Fifth Amendment consideration.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2755.224,2765.831,"Then determining it on fact is what I'm interested is what's my standards, what guides me if no constitutional provision and no law?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2765.831,2772.462,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, I think the standard here would be when one views the facts."
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.468,2842.746,Did that notice get delivered before the interrogatories were answered?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2842.746,2845.481,The notice was sent out on December 29.
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2853.06,2857.914,"Well, had the interrogatories been answered by the 15?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2857.914,2858.556,"No, sir."
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2932.362,2939.714,"I think, I may have diverted you from responding to Justice Black's question about the standards that he, so I tell you that --"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2939.714,2952.967,I would answer Mr. Justice Black this way that the standard is a standard which depends upon the facts in any given case.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2954.949,2962.046,"But the standard, when you get to the facts, is it a natural law standard, something that's above the law?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2962.046,2966.811,"I would say, it's a standard of fairness in the administration of criminal justice and I was --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2966.811,2968.644,Who's to define the fairness?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2968.644,2984.997,"I would say the Court should decide on the basis of the facts whether under our form of free Government, whether drawing upon the concepts of criminal jurisprudence which have come to us through the ages, whether it is inherently unfair --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2984.997,2986.551,Through the ages you say?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2986.551,2988.466,"Through the ages, yes sir."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2988.845,2991.784,"That's -- [Attempt to Laughter] [Inaudible] standard, isn't it?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,2991.784,3008.989,"Well, the Boyd case which is still as vital as it was in the 19 Century seems to require that the courts to decide these -- some of these cases on the McNab case --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3008.989,3012.073,"As noted, but decided on the Fifth Amendment?"

1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.398,3016.923,[Inaudible] or both?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3016.923,3031.238,"Well, I think the narrow -- the technical holding of Boyd was the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment as I read the case Mr. Justice Black and the District Court here apparently felt that it's even broader than that."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3039.843,3060.322,"What's unfair if somebody has violated the law and you have no legal standard which says its not unfair, what's unfair about the Government trying to get facts even by asking a defendant, you said supposed to be to violate the law, outside of the provision to the Constitution, what's unfair about it?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3060.322,3061.54,What is unfair about it --
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3061.54,3062.195,Yes.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3062.195,3073.044,"-- Mr. Justice Black is that where there is a civil case, he is faced with what I would call a cruel trilemma, either a cruel trilemma, he must either --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3073.044,3074.0,Trilemma?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3074.0,3079.891,"Trilemma and the Court of Appeals made this point, he is then confronted with three alternatives."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3084.359,3090.133,"Well, of course this -- the law doesn't assume that a man would lie?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3090.133,3095.467,"That is true, but that's one of the alternatives which he shouldn't be required to select."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3096.574,3103.872,"Well, he would -- he is always required to do it if he asked the question that something when he's guilty."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3103.872,3104.25,"Well, --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3104.25,3109.56,"When the only way he can get out would be to lie, I guess, that will always be the way."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3109.56,3110.072,"Well, he could claim --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3110.072,3127.247,"When absent some special privilege granted him under the Constitution, how can we get to what's fair, so as to make it a law, natural law?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3127.247,3137.498,I think the problem Mr. Justice Black here is that the Government is arguing a very technical and very mechanical interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3137.498,3140.739,"Well, that's different."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3140.739,3146.003,"That is a different question, but it's related to the question which Your Honor asks for this reason."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3146.003,3154.494,"Well, I don't see that it is because that is a Fifth Amendment which we are sworn to obey and enforce."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3154.494,3163.19,"Well, McNab was not decided on any constitutional provision as I recall the McNab case."
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3170.866,3194.75,"But it was decided, was it not, under the criminal, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and I should think in answer to Mr. Justice Black, we are of course, sworn to uphold and force the Constitution but there are also are statutes and in with particular reference to this case, there are Federal Rules of Civil Procedure created, promulgated, and laid down by this Court."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3227.263,3230.134,"I agree with my brother about the rules, but which rule?"
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3235.676,3237.557,Rule 33 and others.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3237.557,3241.975,"Well, [Attempt to Laughter] thank you Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3253.24,3257.531,But is there one which forbids what was done here?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3257.531,3265.996,"I would say that the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure which incorporates the McNab Rule, I believe, its 41 (b) into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3265.996,3267.558,Does it?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3272.137,3286.55,The rule I'm referring to has the effect Mr. Justice Black as I read the rule of granting the Court authority to supervise the fair administration of criminal justice and the --
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3286.55,3287.581,Which one is that?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3287.581,3290.232,I believe it's 41 --
1969.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.232,3305.371,"That's a search and seizure, no --"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3305.371,3331.972,"Your Honors, may I point out in that connection of fairness that in the instant case, an official of the Food and Drug Administration testified, that it was the routine practice over the past 38 years for the Food and Drug Administration to file interrogatories and then take the answers to those interrogatories and use them in the criminal case at the very time that the Court, the FDA was considering a criminal case --"
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3331.972,3350.755,"Well didn't the Constitution put a barrier up so that was the protection for all the citizens by saying that if a question might, it need not be one which is bound to incriminate you, but if it has tendency to incriminate you, you do not need to answer."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3354.607,3356.164,That's -- that's a protection.
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3358.443,3362.221,How can you have a better protection in the matter an absolute right to refuse to answer?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3362.221,3412.039,"Except Mr. Chief Justice that in this case, they would deny us that protection because they say, technically the interrogatories were directed to the corporation which doesn't enjoy the privilege, and we say, and the Court held below that Kordel was the dominant personality, the corporation was merely a device, an instrumentality through which he sold his products, that the interrogatories would directed in his activities and that since they choose to get this information about him by asking a corporation the questions in effect since they have breeched the corporate veil and the questions that they asked, they shouldn't be permitted to repair that breech to deny Kordel his Fifth Amendment privilege and --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3412.039,3416.004,"Well, had he asserted it?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3416.004,3419.747,That was I believe Your Honor asked me that question before and he did not assert --
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3419.747,3421.609,You said denied his privilege --
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3421.609,3421.773,He did not --
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3421.773,3427.594,"As you said they denied and I base that on the question, did he assert it?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3427.594,3443.203,He did not assert it but I think a more complete answer Your Honor would be that he did not waive it either because of the motion that was made at the time to excuse him from being or excuse the corporation from being required to answered the question.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3507.406,3509.054,"Well, were you his lawyer at that time?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3509.054,3511.082,"Yes, I was Your Honor."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3511.082,3513.337,Did you advise him not to answer?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3513.337,3540.59,"I advised him at that time Your Honor and we did file a motion to be excused from answering the questions temporarily, pending the outcome of the criminal case and when the judge, it was Judge Levin of the District Court, heard the argument, the Government represented to the Court and this is in the record, that there was no certainty when or if or whether or if there would ever be a criminal case so the Court said."
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3541.138,3544.051,"You didn't take a prosecutor's word for that order, representing the Court --"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3544.051,3547.099,"Well, I admired that in this case Mr. Justice Black."
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3574.758,3576.571,"Mr. Friend, I have one question for this."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3576.571,3576.894,Yes sir.
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3576.894,3591.272,"It's not, if you don't mind, it is not -- it clear to me, what use was in fact made of the material that was acquired by means of this pretrial discovery in the civil litigation."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3595.172,3605.504,The Court of Appeals answered that question and I'd like to refer to the Court to not only with the Court of Appeals said but the actual transcript.
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3689.227,3690.587,That was for the indictment?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3690.587,3691.762,That was for the indictment.
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3691.762,3692.34,Good.
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3692.421,3692.559,That the interstate --
1969.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3692.559,3694.191,That part was directed to the trial?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3694.191,3698.252,That was prior to the trial but with respect to the interstate commerce.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3768.385,3773.33,Where do you get that stand because its unhoard to you?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3773.33,3786.123,"I believe I got that from Mr. Justice Black, from a dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in the Abel case, US against Abel, and the -- I feel very --"
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3786.123,3787.977,Was that referred to this problem?
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3787.977,3792.962,It's a related problem in that -- the Court there was dealing --
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3792.962,3798.084,"If you settings view of something to happen in that case, wasn't it?"
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3798.084,3800.511,As I recall that case sir.
1969.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3800.67,3804.478,"I think I'd agreed with it, I'm not mistaken it."
1969.87,1,41288,solomon_h_friend,,3804.478,3806.499,I believe you did.
1969.87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3811.56,3816.77,You have two minutes Mr. Wallace.
1969.87,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3816.77,3832.946,The Government did not make multiple seizures eventually in this case and in administering food and drug laws the Government tries to avoid making multiple seizures of products that are not harmful in themselves.
1969.87,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3893.528,3894.432,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
