2018.17-988,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.115,6.39,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-988, Lamps Plus versus Varela. Mr. Pincus."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,6.39,34.25,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly recognized that the changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class action arbitration are fundamental. The question in this case is what standard a court should apply in determining whether an arbitration agreement authorizes class arbitration. As a threshold matter, we think it's clear that federal law imposes a minimum standard that must be satisfied in order to permit class arbitration."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.68,62.425,"But don't you make that determination under state law? I didn't think the FAA in any way undoes state law, unless the basis of the state law is directed only at arbitration, which isn't the case here."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,62.425,64.065,"I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.04,77.96,"Well, that's a standard that's basically dicta because there the parties agree the agreement didn't."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,78.31,93.74,"No, but -- but in First Options, where the Court adopted that standard, the Court said that it was the FAA that imposes the clear and unmistakable requirement before the -- before an arbitration agreement may be construed to delegate gateway issues to the arbitrator."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.74,96.105,I -- I do have one more question for me.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,117.56,126.815,"If -- if the case is in the same posture as this one where the district court dismissed the action, then -- then the -- the provision that we rely on, Section 16(a)(3), would provide for an appeal."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,126.815,129.345,So what's good for the goose is good for the gander?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,129.345,130.83,"Absolutely, Your Honor. And that's --"
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,130.83,131.19,All right.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,147.86,149.75,"Well, it's not just class arbitration."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.28,168.29,The courts aren't staying those cases?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,168.29,168.83,Excuse me?
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.83,169.05,They haven't --
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,169.05,171.605,"Some courts stay them and some courts don't, Your Honor."
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,171.605,187.295,"Why? I mean, throughout -- again, throughout law, there's always a fight between making interlocutory matters immediately appealable, which, if you do, will often save a lot of money, and waiting until the end."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,231.255,233.04,"Well, a couple of answers, Your Honor."
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,269.585,312.595,"May I ask, Mr. Pincus, if you could go back to the -- the substantive argument? So, in -- in a strange kind of way, it occurred to me, as Mr. Geyser was speaking, your position is very similar to Mr. Geyser's. You both have these very broad -- this very broad contractual language, right? He had a broad delegation clause, and you have contractual language that refers to all disputes, claims, or controversies in lieu of any and all suits or other civil legal proceedings. And -- and what I hear you to be saying is essentially that you want to say except for class suits."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,313.915,315.49,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,323.26,336.05,"Well, I -- I'm just thinking as a -- as a matter first of -- of just contract law, because he said what we have here is we can't really believe that the parties agreed to include a certain set of things."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,345.185,349.19,I think the contractual language here is actually quite clear.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.91,404.015,"Well, it seems to me, I mean, there's -- there's language that's in favor of each side's position."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,431.05,444.77,"I don't think it's about an implicit concept -- exception, Your Honor. In Stolt-Nielsen, the Court said we can't presume from a -- an arbitration -- the fact of an arbitration agreement that the parties have agreed to class arbitration because of the fundamental differences."
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,444.94,447.47,"Yes, but in -- in Stolt-Nielsen, there was no contract."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,483.36,488.16,"Well, I -- I guess I'll -- there are a couple of questions embodied in your question, I think."
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,499.4,500.02,"Well, we would never say --"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,500.02,500.23,But -- but --
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,500.23,500.92,-- that in general.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,534.47,554.17,"Well, we think Stolt-Nielsen said that there is a special contractual rule and that there are -- there are two possibilities there. We think the most sensible rule is to apply the clear and unmistakable standard because of the fundamental change that arises from class arbitration to -- from bilateral arbitration to class arbitration. One of the -- one --"
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,554.17,556.29,Now we're creating a federal common law --
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,556.29,556.945,Well --
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,556.945,561.08,-- something we're loathe to do in virtually every other context?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,561.08,561.67,"Well, just --"
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,561.67,566.895,I think we were very clear that it's a matter of contract and state law controls that.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,566.895,569.23,"I -- I think the Court has not been clear, Your Honor."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.48,584.74,That's really interesting.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,584.74,584.89,-- clear --
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,584.89,587.405,Where does the FAA give us that right?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,587.405,599.07,"The Court many years ago in Moses Cone said there was another contractual rule, which says that close questions about arbitrability should go to arbitrability because of the policy embodied in the FAA."
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.07,601.485,"Look, I want you to finish that."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,602.61,612.42,"Well, I was just going to respond to Justice Sotomayor's question about where the -- where that comes from in the FAA. And I think it comes from Section 4 of the FAA."
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.93,665.16,All right.
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,665.16,666.8,So is your -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.8,667.675,"No, you go ahead."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.675,698.54,"Is your position that the decision below was right on state law? Basically, you're not quarrelling that this contract was ambiguous, that it was susceptible to the meaning Petitioner -- that Respondent gave it, and that under California law, that would encompass this claim because they weren't the drafters? Is your position now that federal common law is superseding state law --"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,698.54,700.15,"Well, I -- I think our position --"
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,700.15,701.06,-- on how to interpret a contract?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,701.06,710.67,-- I think our position has consistently been that our principal argument is that there is a federal rule that Stolt-Nielsen identified --
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,710.67,712.08,I -- I asked you a different question.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,712.08,724.18,"And our position on -- on California law is we think that the lower court did wrongly apply California law and applied it in a way to reach a result, and -- and we point to the two California court of appeals -- court of appeal decisions."
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,724.18,724.27,Okay.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,743.77,743.89,Well --
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,743.89,746.25,It's really a federal rule that you're asking for.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,746.25,748.2,We -- we are advocating a federal rule.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,763.63,764.64,Right.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,782.08,789.27,"Just -- just, Your Honor, as in the case of the question of whether a contract delegates arbitrability to the arbitrator."
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,799.23,799.4,Right.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,799.73,801.03,We have to have clear and unmistakable language.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,801.03,803.03,I'm just trying to get a handle on what you're saying.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,803.03,803.17,Yes.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,803.17,805.49,So -- so you're saying it's a federal rule.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,808.515,815.17,I think it comes from exactly the same place as the First Options rule and -- and from the discussion of this very issue in Stolt-Nielsen.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,854.25,854.84,Quite right.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,896.66,923.38,"I think it comes from the same place that the Moses Cone presumption comes from and the First Options presumption, the rule of clear and unmistakability comes from, and the Howsam rule of clear and unmistakable requirement comes from, which is Section 4. What the Court has said is, with respect to some critical questions, it wants -- there is a federal rule of decision that comes from Section 4 to make certain that the authority delegated to the arbitrator has, in fact, been delegated."
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,923.38,923.57,You're --
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,923.57,924.82,"See, I thought -- go ahead."
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,924.82,925.725,Go ahead.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,925.725,926.855,Please.
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,926.855,938.925,"You're saying if -- even if it's a questionable interpretation of that statutory language, again, similar to the last case with Justice Kagan's question, the precedent, the ship has sailed?"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,938.925,941.32,"Well, I think the ship has certainly sailed --"
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,941.32,945.62,"In Stolt-Nielsen -- in Stolt-Nielsen, at least you're saying the ship's a long way -- a long way off --"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,945.62,946.565,I think -- I think --
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,946.565,959.81,-- because -- because Stolt-Nielsen said that you needed something on the order of express language or indicated or hinted at least is what you're saying here?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,959.81,979.78,"I think it's impossible to read the discussion on Stolt-Nielsen on pages 681 to 685 and conclude anything other than the fact that the court concluded there that there was a federal rule of interpretation that it didn't have to flesh -- it said at Footnote 10, in fact, we don't have to decide what that standard is because --"
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,979.78,998.6,"Because the only federal rule was that it needed to be based on an agreement of the parties, because it said arbitration is a matter of consent, and that's all over the Arbitration Act. But the question of how to understand whether parties have consented, that's usually a question of state law."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,998.6,998.88,Except --
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,998.88,1010.37,"And you are saying a federal rule should come in and say, notwithstanding state law saying that these two parties have agreed to something, the federal rule under the Arbitration Act says no."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1010.37,1010.76,Well --
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1010.76,1040.225,And usually what the Federal Arbitration Act does is it -- it surely does come into play when you're afraid that the state law is discriminating against arbitration agreements. But where there is no such concern -- and I don't think that there is such a concern if the state -- if the state courts just say we're going to treat general language as including everything inside it -- then I don't see where the federal law comes into play to create a different contract interpretive rule.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1040.225,1055.51,"Well, First Options and Howsam were not concerned with discrimination. They were concerned with being certain that when significant power is being assigned to the arbitrator, that the -- that there be clear and unmistakable indication that that was the parties' intent."
2018.17-988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.51,1086.29,"How can that -- how can there be clear and unmistakable here? Let's take Concepcion, where the concern was that these arbitration agreements supposedly based on consent were adhesion contracts, and Concepcion said the court -- the court said that the states remain free to take steps addressing concerns attending adhesion contracts."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1121.275,1128.04,"Well, this -- this might be a different case if the question were whether class actions are excluded from the agreement."
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.805,1173.62,"Can -- can I go back for a second to the procedural problem? You -- you're plaintiff and you bring a case, and you say, Judge, I want you to send this to arbitration, right? And the other side says, no, Judge, we want you to decide the issue. That's a normal case."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1241.44,1244.88,"Well, the -- the Court did decide the issue in Randolph."
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1249.185,1250.9,"Well, maybe we got it wrong."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1250.9,1251.31,-- on arbitration.
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.31,1252.625,Maybe it wasn't fully argued and --
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1252.625,1253.05,"Well, I think --"
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.05,1260.74,"-- and then I just don't see why we should treat this area of the law when here, unlike the other areas, there is Section 3."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1260.74,1261.715,Your Honor --
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1261.715,1268.96,Why should we treat it differently and suddenly reach a tough issue when the statute seems to say don't?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1268.96,1271.53,"Well, a couple of -- a couple of answers."
2018.17-988,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1283.45,1283.68,That's true.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1283.68,1287.535,-- inexorable pressure to settle in courts in class litigation.
2018.17-988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.22,1341.54,"But if that -- if that were -- were the case, that the district court has no authority to dismiss, must simply stay the case in court, would you agree that that is not a final judgment, there's no appeal?"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1341.54,1366.17,"Well, the Court addressed this question in Randolph, which, as I say, was in this posture, and said that the fact that -- the -- the question whether the district court had the power to dismiss, A, was not before it and did not preclude it from hearing the case. I think if the -- if this Court were to hold that a stay was -- was the only permissible option, then, obviously, there wouldn't be an appeal."
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1389.29,1396.99,"In how many of those cases -- in how many of those cases is -- in this case, the Respondents did not ask for a stay, correct?"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1396.99,1397.99,True.
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1397.99,1401.49,And so the statute seems permissive.
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1406.07,1407.47,I believe that's right.
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.47,1411.425,"And in those Ninth Circuit cases, even if there's a request for a stay --"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1411.425,1412.05,Yes.
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1412.05,1412.27,-- they hold --
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1412.27,1417.59,The Ninth Circuit takes the position that the district court has the option of whether or not to dismiss or stay.
2018.17-988,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1417.59,1423.475,So it then gives the district court the power to decide what's appealable or not?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1423.475,1424.29,Yes.
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1424.29,1435.69,"If you just had -- if you just had the statute and not Stolt-Nielsen or the other precedents you've cited, in response to Justice Kagan's question, how would you answer where does it come from?"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1435.69,1439.97,"I -- I would still say that it -- it comes from the language of the statute, which says --"
2018.17-988,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1439.97,1440.43,Which -- which language?
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1440.43,1461.96,"-- in accordance -- shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and that some issues confer some -- some decisions confer such power on the arbitrator that federal law -- before federal law confers that power on the arbitrator, federal law wants to be very sure that -- that the parties have intended that result."
2018.17-988,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1461.96,1491.68,"Well, Mr. Pincus, could one read that same language as suggesting not that the district court gets the opportunity to decide the nature of the arbitration but merely whether there's an agreement to arbitrate and that procedures like class or individualized proceedings are not within the scope of what Section 4 contemplates and that the error here is really that the district court shouldn't have gotten in the business of specifying the procedures that would be followed in arbitration?"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1491.68,1504.35,"Well, many -- many arbitration agreements expressly allocate the authority to decide this question to the -- to the arbitrator because it is such -- to the court, rather, because it's such an important question."
2018.17-988,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1504.35,1505.11,"Well, I understand that --"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1505.11,1505.98,This -- this case --
2018.17-988,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1505.98,1512.075,"-- but that would then come within the context of the -- of the statutory language, is there an agreement to arbitrate."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1514.34,1514.59,No.
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1521.505,1523.955,"One quick one, Mr. Pincus."
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1541.18,1543.16,That it was not intended to authorize class --
2018.17-988,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1543.16,1561.82500005,"No, I mean what would be enough for you to switch your position, essentially? Like if this -- if this -- if -- you say a clear statement rule isn't required, but, you know, what -- what kind of language would say, ah, I can see that the parties agreed to class arbitration there?"
2018.17-988,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1561.82500005,1572.945,If there wasn't the provision that I read and the -- the agreement simply said we agree that we can bring any lawsuits that we could bring against one another in court.
2018.17-988,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1585.47,1595.615,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Vercoski."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1595.615,1615.455,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, were the court within the appellate jurisdiction and thus properly before this Court, this Court should rule that the FAA does not preempt the application of neutral state contract principles to determine whether an arbitration agreement permits arbitration here."
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.455,1618.38,"Well, the question really is whether they're neutral principles."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1637.37,1638.25,Right.
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1679.1,1689.635,"Nowadays, many arbitration contracts, many adhesion contracts, do put in explicit class action waivers."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1704.525,1716.62,"If that is the case, Your Honor, and it is clear and explicit that there is a class action waiver, then, yes, the parties' intent has to rule out under contract rules."
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1716.62,1738.635,"So if -- if, as I suggested before, if we say that, then all the parties who want to arbitrate bilaterally will simply put in their contract a class action is waived and the party to that adhesion contract can't do anything about that."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1738.635,1757.74,"They can't do anything about that if that's clear and unmistakable, and so we have to give intent to the parties. And at the same token, if the parties did agree to proceed with class arbitration, that too under the FAA would be required to enforce the parties' intent."
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1757.74,1774.655,"So, here, where the concern is lawyers that are less than the best and didn't put in a class action waiver, those -- those contracts, in those cases, class arbitration will be permitted?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1774.655,1814.35,"Well, it depends on the language of the -- of the actual agreement. And to the extent that the terms speak to class arbitration, even if it's not explicit, we have to determine the difference between whether it's silent and whether there's something there that supports a class arbitration, whether or not it's explicit with the words class arbitration. And in order to do that, the norm under the FAA is that we employ neutral contract interpretation principles, like we would to all contracts to determine what the parties' intent was with respect to class arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.35,1819.87,"Well, but, I mean, it's, I guess, Justice Jackson's phrase, I mean, the FAA is not a suicide pact."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1835.755,1868.91,"Yes, that would be an exception to the normal rule because that is elevated and -- and the FAA had determined that, first and foremost, that the policy overrides that we want to enforce arbitration agreements, to the extent they're ambiguous, unlike the normal rule, when interpreting ancillary issues with respect to that agreement, when it comes to arbitration, issues of arbitrability, the default rule is they are construed in -- in favor of arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.195,1876.265,"The FAA has rules that govern class arbitration, don't they?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1876.265,1879.45,"They do, but it's not federal common rule that supplants --"
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.45,1890.87,"No, no, I'm just saying this is an arbitration association and the arbitration association has rules governing class arbitration, so they must not see class arbitration as a poison pill."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1895.44,1899.26,"Correct, to the extent that the parties did agree to -- to do so."
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.62,1901.54,"Well, I thought the --"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1901.54,1902.23,-- be enforced.
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.23,1908.685,I thought those same rules specify that the rules themselves do not provide a basis for assuming there's class arbitration.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1908.685,1913.03,There's no assumption one way or the other.
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1936.775,1949.95,"Counsel, if -- if this is enough, this contract under ordinary and plain state law principles where it often in the text speaks of my claims and me and I --"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1949.95,1950.65,Right.
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1950.65,1985.625,"-- if -- if that's enough, what do we do with the due process problem that Justice Alito pointed out in Oxford Health where you would have potentially class members purportedly bound by an arbitration, this is in a court of law, where we can adjudicate absent class members rights consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment because of the procedural protections associated with court proceedings. What do we do about those absent class members in opt-out classes permitted by whatever arbitrable forum's rules prevail?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,1985.625,1997.97,"Well, first of all, the -- the policy issues with respect to due process are outside of the question presented. But even if this Court were to consider those, this is an antecedent question."
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1997.97,2008.61,"Should we -- should we ignore them in considering the impact here of the Arbitration Act and normal contract principles and whether normal contract principles would abide due process, for example?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2008.61,2014.835,"The -- to the extent that due process concerns come into play, that's at a much later stage of the game."
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.84,2020.895,"Well, what happens in the -- in the arbitration? So suppose it's a class."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2034.735,2035.35,Right.
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2073.26,2080.82,But do you think that -- that absent class members who didn't agree to arbitration could be bound by the decision of the arbitrator?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2080.82,2082.21,"Yes, they can."
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2082.21,2082.975,How?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2082.975,2094.04,"Because down -- if they do decide to certify the class, they could employ the same due process protections, such as opt-out procedures."
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2108.73,2121.395,"Well, if they have a legal claim, how can they be deprived of their legal claim pursuant to an arbitration award if they never agreed to arbitration? I thought arbitration was a matter of contract."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2121.395,2137.43,"Well, in the first instance, it's a matter of contract right as to whether or not the contract actually will permit the proceedings. Now the -- the arbitrator might get that issue and decide it doesn't meet the threshold."
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2183.07,2184.225,Suppose -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2184.225,2188.99,"No, that's okay. That's just an issue that's resolved later on down the road."
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2207.38,2211.95,"Well, under an extraordinarily deferential standard of review."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2211.95,2216.88,"For the arbitrator, yes, for -- for their decision on class arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2241.1,2241.78,So why did you let --
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2241.78,2242.09,-- would apply.
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2242.09,2245.25,So why did you let the court decide that issue?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2245.25,2260.8,"We wanted the court to decide the issue because, in the beginning, we were also questioning the issue of arbitrability as to whether or not the data breach claims that we were alleging even fell within the -- in the scope of the arbitration agreement."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2262.73,2276.955,"Well, it seems to me -- I'm not quite sure why you did what you did, but it seems to me that that would have been clearly for the arbitrators under the terms of this contract because it's related to -- it --"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2276.955,2286.045,"The arbitrator -- yes, the agreement at issue definitely did have a delegation clause that gave the ability for the arbitrator to decide these decisions."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2293.015,2293.63,You know --
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2293.63,2294.75,-- issue involved.
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2294.75,2298.13,-- class action is a procedural process.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2298.13,2298.815,Correct.
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2298.815,2309.205,"And, in my mind, that quintessentially is always an arbitrator's question, what -- when you hold the hearings, how you hold them, where."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2324.2,2324.63,Right.
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2326.62,2334.92,And what is the context of that then? So the court says that I order class arbitration.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2365.395,2366.47,They do.
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2368.15,2372.745,So -- so is -- is the arbitrator forbidden from making those inquiries by this ruling?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2372.745,2408.2,"It -- the way that the JAMS and the AAA class arbitration issues are drafted, they say that whether a court decided the threshold issue as to whether the contract provided a basis to permit the class -- to -- to permit the parties to go on a class arbitration basis, that doesn't stop the inquiry. So it -- it appears from the rules that the arbitrator has to give deference to that initial threshold ruling, but that doesn't mean that they have to ultimately certify the class."
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2408.2,2409.32,So -- so why are we bothering --
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2409.32,2409.72,It doesn't mean the --
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2409.72,2443.075,"-- with it then? I mean, if at the end of the day we're going to have this large dispute in district court over whether the contract permits this or that procedure, I mean, are we going to have disputes over whether it permits discovery? And that's a contract issue that the parties negotiated? Other kinds of procedures that might be allowed or disallowed in a -- in an arbitration proceeding? It seems like a lot of collateral expense and -- and difficulty that seems kind of a little inconsistent with the idea of getting to arbitration quickly and that the district court proceedings are supposed to be summary."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2444.39,2448.56,"Right, if you're expanding it to issues beyond class arbitration and including them --"
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2448.56,2452.93,"Well, you expand it beyond the question of -- up -- thumbs up or down on arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2452.93,2454.53,"Right, and what --"
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2454.53,2457.575,To -- to what kind of procedures that arbitration might address.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2457.575,2458.15,Right.
2018.17-988,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2466.78,2469.355,"Well, here we are. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2469.355,2469.47,I know.
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2477.75,2478.33,"Well, wait a minute."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2480.405,2488.225,We did not ask for a stay at the time because we were ready to go and for expediency and --
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2488.225,2489.29,"Yeah, so you -- you --"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2489.29,2506.12,-- to get the benefits. So -- so we were fine proceeding on a class basis and were ready to go to arbitration. Lamps Plus fought that and issued a stay because they didn't agree with the way -- they didn't get the -- what they wanted in asking for the order to compel -- compel arbitration.
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.12,2506.53,Suppose that you --
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2506.53,2512.68,"They got -- they got their order compelling it, but they -- they didn't like that it wasn't limited to an individual basis."
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2512.68,2528.115,Suppose you -- suppose the district court dismissed your court claims and then ordered bilateral arbitration. Would you have an appeal?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2528.115,2529.05,I would not.
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2532.55,2549.385,"Where you would be stuck with what -- whatever the -- if the court said bilateral, you have no appeal; if it says class action, the other side, you say also has no appeal?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2549.385,2557.915,"On that particular issue alone in that order, isolated, looking at the order to compel arbitration, yes, I wouldn't have a basis."
2018.17-988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.295,2575.82,But --
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2575.82,2576.755,Under -- under Randolph?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2576.755,2579.49,But you would have a final -- under Randolph.
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2662.395,2689.44,"So, counsel, if there's a contract between two businesses, and business A drafts the contract, business B accepts the contract, there's nothing in the contract about arbitration, but a state court -- but it turns out that A, which -- the party that drafted the contract, doesn't want arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2705.455,2715.445,That the -- that it would err on the side of not finding for arbitration because it would be construed against the drafter who was --
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2715.445,2716.76,It would err on the side of --
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2716.76,2717.19,-- doing the proposing?
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2717.19,2725.785,-- finding arbitration because the -- the -- it was -- it was drafted by the party that objects to arbitration.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2725.785,2741.71,"So, in that case, there is a special rule under the FAA that, instead of construing it against a drafter, the FAA trumps that situation where you have to construe it in favor of arbitrability."
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.71,2744.17,This is --
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2744.17,2747.845,This is -- this would be a decision in favor of arbitrability.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2747.845,2749.275,Right.
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2749.275,2754.735,So what's the difference between that situation and the situation here?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2754.735,2759.67,"Well, the -- there was a decision issuing a --"
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2759.67,2773.925,"In other words, if state law -- if state law governs, that's the decision under state law in this hypothetical, there must be arbitration even in the absence of any arbitration clause whatsoever."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2779.73,2780.21,It would be --
2018.17-988,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2780.21,2789.57,"And if not, doesn't that show that the FAA imposes some rules that super -- that supersede state law?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2789.57,2790.42,Right.
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.415,2810.96,"Here is the problem like that that I'm having: All that you have in the California law, all we have here is the contract says in lieu of any and all lawsuits we're going to have arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2819.165,2820.69,In the contract at issue?
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.69,2822.74,"In the contract at issue, I gather."
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.23,2843.56,I'm not sure.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2886.26,2886.415,Uh-huh.
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.415,2891.91,And so we have the case right there with the language.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2895.1,2895.3,Right.
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2895.3,2907.35,"And we have a special rule, which is their right, I guess, that we find ambiguity there, though the textbooks say don't, okay? So that's the main point on the merits as I see it."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2911.405,2917.675,"Well, first of all, in Stolt-Nielsen, they did not interpret the agreement's language at all."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.6,2971.28,"The problem I have is the following, because it -- it's following up on Justice Alito's question, okay? There are at least two or three California lower courts and at least one court of appeals who have seen contracts almost identical to this --"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,2971.28,2971.905,Yes.
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2971.905,3001.21,"-- and said, contrary to the lower court, to the lower court here, to the Ninth Circuit, that that language is not enough to have a foothold in the contract under California law, because the words ""the waiver of all lawsuits or other civil legal proceedings,"" you have to submit everything to arbitration, don't say anything about the nature, the procedural nature, of that arbitration."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3012.015,3012.94,"Yes, it --"
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3012.94,3038.69,"And so those courts, unlike the court here, is basically saying that the court below misapplied state law. Now are we supposed to give deference to the state court on its interpretation of state law, or are we supposed to check to make sure that they are, in fact, following state law?"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3038.69,3041.47,"Well, that's not even an issue here because --"
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3041.47,3042.3,"Well, it is an issue --"
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3042.3,3042.63,"Well, it's an issue --"
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3042.63,3046.94,"-- because, if this contract doesn't speak at all, there's no foothold."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3046.94,3048.81,Our contract absolutely does.
2018.17-988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3061.9,3064.94,So what's the best statement in the contract that supports you?
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3064.94,3075.365,"In our contract, the very best one is arbitration shall be in lieu of any and all lawsuits or civil legal proceedings relating to my employment."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3092.92,3100.33,My problem with that is arbitration isn't law proceedings by definition.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3128.72,3130.86,"Well, I'm not thinking that it's special."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3200.135,3204.27,"No, it doesn't. No, he's granted that right as a procedural right in the lawsuit."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3209.58,3210.47,He absolutely is.
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3210.47,3211.77,That's a separate --
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3211.77,3217.365,"Because the word ""proceeding"" is extremely broad and it includes legal actions or procedures."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3310.41,3312.015,Class action is not a remedy.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3312.015,3319.29,"No, class action's not a remedy, but remedies can be awarded and are awarded through class actions."
2018.17-988,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3319.29,3320.57,"To other people, not him."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3320.57,3327.49,"To other people, but there's nothing that prohibits him from bringing an arbitration, only his individual claims."
2018.17-988,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3338.09,3345.53,"Counsel, in -- the dissenting judge below said that the Ninth Circuit's decision was a palpable evasion of Stolt-Nielsen."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3360.055,3361.11,Absolutely.
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3430.33,3430.72,Thank you.
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3430.72,3432.405,And that should have been overruled.
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3432.405,3433.67,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-988,1,63045,michele_m_vercoski,,3433.67,3434.16,Thank you.
2018.17-988,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.16,3437.03999995,"Four minutes, Mr. Pincus."
2018.17-988,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3437.03999995,3440.265,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-988,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3500.835,3505.18,Wouldn't they be bound if they got notice and an opportunity to opt out?
2018.17-988,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3505.18,3526.85,"I think there are serious questions that were pointed out by Justice Alito in -- in his Oxford Health dissent about whether an arbitration to which they didn't consent could bind them, especially if they could prevail on an argument that the arbitration agreement did not provide for class arbitration. That would be their argument."
2018.17-988,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3601.9,3603.16,"Thank you, counsel."
