2002.01-705,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.846,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-705, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Company and a related case."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,77.678,81.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.782,129.305,But that's not true.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,156.954,173.596,"Well, the statute does provide for administrative review of assignment so that a coal operator who was assigned a miner in error could challenge that before the commissioner, and if the commissioner found that the assignment was erroneous, the miner could be assigned to a... a more appropriate coal operator."
2002.01-705,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.783,189.86,What happens to someone who wasn't assigned before October 1st?
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,193.148,193.781,No.
2002.01-705,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.32,243.099,"Ms. McDowell, there... there is a section, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment of unassigned premiums."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,270.15,281.114,"I think the situation addressed in that provision is quite different, even assuming that it unequivocally establishes that the commissioner couldn't reassign somebody after a company went into bankruptcy."
2002.01-705,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.612,311.78,"Well, it does show at least that much, that Congress didn't want to continue perpetually to adjust these things for the--"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,311.78,313.134,"--Yes, that's correct."
2002.01-705,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.162,346.293,"--Is it possible that that deadline was some kind of political compromise, so to speak, at the time it was passed and the operators thought, well, that's it?"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,349.357,353.354,"--Well, there's... there's no indication in the text or legislative history that that was contemplated."
2002.01-705,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.871,371.001,"Well, you... you say Congress is legislating in light of our decision in Pierce County."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,381.332,399.152,"--Congress didn't explicitly say so, no, but as, we have cited a number of statutes in our briefs that made clear that when Congress wants to terminate an agency's authority to make decisions at a particular point, Congress knows how to say so explicitly and it has done so in those situations."
2002.01-705,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.201,404.551,"Well, this is... this is quite different than Pierce County, though, at least certainly on its facts."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,430.84,441.642,"Well, I think it's clear that Congress imposed deadlines, not only this deadline, but other deadlines in the statute, because it wanted to get the new funding mechanism established by the Coal Act into place."
2002.01-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.885,482.796,Is there any limiting principle to your interpretation?
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,484.151,488.158,"--Oh, the statute doesn't itself impose a limit on the commissioner's authority."
2002.01-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.836,515.145,"Would you tell us what percentage of the assignments were made after the deadline, and how long after the deadline was the most recent assignment?"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,515.145,517.414,Yes.
2002.01-705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.423,594.145,"When there is a reassignment or taking somebody out of the unassigned pool and attributing that person to an operator, does the operator who has now gotten the assignment have to pay interest for the period from October '93 on, or is it just that you pay now the bill that we would have sent you if we had charged you in '93?"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,594.145,594.896,The latter.
2002.01-705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,598.002,598.2,So that the--
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,598.2,603.951,--the operator benefits by having the use of the money during the period before the obligation is imposed.
2002.01-705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,603.951,613.507,"--What about the argument that the Social Security Administration stood before Congress and said, we can make this date?"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,632.49,639.766,"Well, in fact, Your Honor, the commissioner didn't say we will make the deadline."
2002.01-705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.164,656.17,I thought there were quotations in the record that had an official from the Social Security Administration telling Congress we are going to do it.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,663.727,681.584,"I think it could have been only an expression of hope in... in September 1993, and then the operators would have received, in many cases, and... and these respondents certainly did... assignments of additional beneficiaries during October 1993, so that should have put them on notice to make inquiry as to precisely when the assignment had been made."
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.155,762.503,"Ms. McDowell, what do you do with the provision of 9704(a)(3)(D) which makes an assigned operator's unassigned beneficiaries' premium equal to the operator's applicable percentage, which is defined as its percentage of total assigned beneficiaries, quote,"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,767.709,784.161,"The statute then goes on to provide for adjustments in years after 1993 for two circumstances: when a change has been made as a result of the administrative review process, and when a change has been made as a result of coal operators going out of business."
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.161,785.209,"Right, but... but--"
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,785.209,785.381,And the fact that Congress--
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.381,797.359,"--but does not make a third exception; that is, a change is made as a result of the... the finding of additional assigned beneficiaries under the... under the commissioner's ability to... to find it after October 1."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,797.359,809.084,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but the fact that Congress said that these adjustments shall be made doesn't suggest that Congress did not intend to permit other appropriate adjustments to be made as well."
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.084,814.827,"No, but what does... what does suggest that is the language, determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,821.828,828.707,"Well, Congress was obviously contemplating, at the point that it enacted the statute, that the deadline would be made, satisfied."
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.338,858.977,"Well, no, it isn't essential but it makes--"
2002.01-705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,858.977,861.112,--It has to because then you'd be paying more than your share.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,879.543,889.516,"--Well, I'm not sure that it would significantly change the... the percentage of the whole that the operator would be required to pay for."
2002.01-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.606,909.676,Would you clarify one thing for me?
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,960.669,966.497,"I'm not aware of any company in that situation, but I think it would be adjusted for post-October assignments as well."
2002.01-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.497,969.586,Despite the language of the statute that Justice Scalia referred to.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,969.586,970.298,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,975.803,978.472,When do you do the adjusting in the... I gather that's what you're doing.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,981.741,985.718,That's a task that's left to the Combined Fund to do.
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.567,999.227,But is... is the percentage recalculated as of the beginning of... of each kind of fiscal year following the... the initial October 1 date?
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1014.46,1023.072,"You know, I think the commissioner typically made one round of assignments a year during the time--"
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1023.072,1023.253,Annually.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1023.253,1024.684,--when she was making additional assignments.
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1024.684,1024.839,Annually.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1024.839,1026.178,"Sometimes two rounds, I believe."
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1026.178,1032.912,And is that made in advance of October 1 each year to commence on October 1 or be effective as of October 1 each year?
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1032.912,1033.31,Yes.
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1033.31,1033.81,Okay.
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.81,1035.94,I still don't see your basis for doing it.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1055.318,1063.322,"Well, Congress didn't foreclose additional adjustments to be assigned beneficiary premium in addition to those specified in the statute."
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.322,1063.568,What do you mean it didn't foreclose?
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1069.876,1076.446,"Well, then if you will turn to the next subsection of the statute, it provides for adjustments for plan years after 1993."
2002.01-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.446,1077.038,For other... exactly.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1085.394,1093.397,"Well, in any event, Your Honor, that particular provision is a separate section of the statute from one addressing the commissioner's assignment authority."
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1104.712,1115.266,"No, but if... if you don't read the two provisions together, if you don't read the shall clause and... and the calculation clause together, you... you get a system which is simply incoherent."
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1148.726,1151.152,"Well, that is certainly how it has been applied."
2002.01-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1151.152,1151.594,That's what you're doing.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1151.594,1158.142,It has been applied flexibly and adjustments in the applicable percentage have been made retroactively.
2002.01-705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.352,1161.029,I have one question.
2002.01-705,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1173.371,1175.531,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.531,1178.965,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1181.098,1188.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1221.797,1229.328,"Counsel, would you explain to us the real world consequences at the end of the day for the respective positions of the parties?"
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1233.357,1234.779,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1245.587,1245.783,Yes.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1245.783,1250.852,But the financing method of the benefits was also a key component of the statute.
2002.01-705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1250.852,1261.675,"Well, that's... the next part of Justice O'Connor's question is... and I had this in mind also... is the fund will always have adequate funds to pay for the unassigned miners, will they not?"
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1263.145,1265.889,"Well, the Combined Fund will--"
2002.01-705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.889,1271.968,The... the plans in that sense aren't hurt because they're... they're not going to run out of money.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1271.968,1278.75,--The Combined Fund will receive funds in accordance with the provisions of the statute.
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1308.684,1310.403,A backwards looking assessment--
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1310.403,1311.186,Correct.
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.186,1312.587,--for those early years.
2002.01-705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.587,1315.905,"But they're not complaining, as I understand it, or am I wrong about that?"
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1315.905,1318.571,"Well, they... they surely are complaining."
2002.01-705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.278,1339.131,But they're not in this case.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1339.131,1342.878,"They're... they're not intervenors in this case, no, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.878,1344.907,Why?
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1357.098,1359.203,UMWA Combined Benefit Fund?
2002.01-705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1359.203,1359.466,--Yes.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1372.811,1378.82,"Your Honor, both the assigned beneficiaries and the unassigned beneficiaries are beneficiaries of the Combined Benefit Fund."
2002.01-705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1395.568,1396.2,And you've given us step one.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1396.882,1399.383,--Step one is the first 3 plan years.
2002.01-705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.383,1399.904,All right.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1399.904,1410.074,"During those 3 plan years, the unassigned beneficiaries are paid for out of the transfers from the UMWA 1950 pension plan."
2002.01-705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.629,1520.374,Which hasn't happened yet in fact.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1520.374,1521.418,It has not happened yet.
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1521.418,1523.177,And how much are we talking about?
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1523.177,1535.996,"Well, right now we're talking... if everyone nationwide affected by this case, if the rule were to change, and you were looking purely prospectively, you have about 4,000 people."
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.317,1537.898,Yes.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1537.898,1539.202,"--you have about 10,000 people."
2002.01-705,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1539.202,1539.388,Yes.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1539.388,1552.178,"And as Mr. Tennielle's declaration, which is in the joint appendix, shows, there is approximately $105 million that was already at stake as of the time of his declaration in 1999, and that number has been growing ever since."
2002.01-705,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.178,1555.502,What exactly is the interest of the trustees that you represent?
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1555.502,1560.702,"Your Honor, the trustees want to see this statute operate the way it's supposed to operate."
2002.01-705,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.421,1564.991,But that's a fairly... what is their financial or pecuniary interest?
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1564.991,1567.655,--The trustee... it's... it's not a financial interest.
2002.01-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.315,1620.168,You can't read that language that way.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1641.194,1641.903,"--It must be, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.774,1647.082,It must be because otherwise your theory doesn't work.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1647.082,1647.568,--No.
2002.01-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.512,1651.839,And... and the other side's theory of the case is... is correct.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1651.839,1659.974,"--No, Your Honor, because when there's a reassignment after an administrative appeal, for example, the reassignment occurs in 1995 or 1996."
2002.01-705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.82,1672.571,So there's a... there's a retroactive assessment?
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1672.571,1673.569,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.937,1720.968,Wouldn't you have to give back money if... if your side does not prevail?
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1734.589,1738.434,"--That's precisely what Mr. Tennielle's declaration points out, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.959,1772.356,"Well, of course."
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1777.103,1778.615,I was just responding to--
2002.01-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.615,1779.615,I... I would hope you give it back.
2002.01-705,1,37735,peter_buscemi,,1780.186,1781.94,--And we did.
2002.01-705,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.94,1784.244,"--Thank you, Mr. Buscemi."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1786.145,1794.949,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-705,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1849.705,1864.061,"Mr. Roberts, all I... all that, I guess, is conceded in the argument, but the... the... when all is said and done, there seems to be an... an inequity as among the operators."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.076,1907.154,Certainly.
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.814,1960.43,"But, Mr. Roberts, didn't you omit one of the other statutory purposes, which was, insofar as possible, to assign responsibility for paying the benefits to the company that had the best, the closest connection with that particular miner?"
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.43,1965.499,"Yes, and we know that was, for example, not a purpose they wanted to pursue ueber alles."
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.331,1970.317,"But it was one of the major purposes, was it not?"
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1970.317,1976.166,"--It was one of the purposes, yes, and it was one that Congress said, spend a year trying to make these assignments."
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.617,2015.316,But they will pay in different amounts.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2020.868,2021.772,"Yes, and the question is--"
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.772,2025.056,And the specific hypothetical that troubles me... let me put it right out on the table.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2042.549,2043.189,--No.
2002.01-705,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2045.557,2051.818,And... and the company which had a full assignment is going to be paying more than its pro rata share.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.818,2052.694,--And Congress knew--
2002.01-705,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2052.694,2055.284,And even though that there was... you say there's rough justice.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2066.257,2079.342,"--And Congress knew there was some unfairness in requiring the companies to pay for unassigned beneficiaries, and it cushioned that unfairness by saying we're going to draw from this AML Fund that coal operators established earlier."
2002.01-705,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.646,2089.317,But I take it that fund itself is maintained based on the... your share of fully assigned miners.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2093.88,2094.058,--No.
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.832,2106.367,"No, but Mr.... let me just interrupt you as to your answer to Justice Kennedy."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.588,2121.009,"--If you have to get to the third stage where there's an unassigned beneficiaries premium assessed, yes."
2002.01-705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.28,2145.861,What is the harm?
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2192.443,2201.506,"--Well... well, it's not like the other regulatory statutes, first of all, because it's an extraordinary grant of the authority to impose retroactive liability."
2002.01-705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.52,2249.24,Is there any way that you or your clients or anyone have been hurt by the delay?
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2249.24,2250.098,"Oh, of course."
2002.01-705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.098,2250.559,That is... how?
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.032,2263.223,"Oh, sure."
2002.01-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.603,2329.924,"But, Mr. Roberts, on the other hand, you are, in fact your companies are paying less than they would have paid had they been billed properly on time because you have had the use of the money in the interim, and Ms. McDowell said you're not being charged any interest because you're paying in 19... or any adjustment for inflation because you get to pay in 19-whatever, '97 dollars a bill that was due from October 1993 and you don't get charged any interest on that."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2329.924,2336.126,I don't think interest is a significant factor just the way the interest rates have been over this time period.
2002.01-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2344.779,2357.183,"But my... my point is simply had you gotten that bill, that... timely, it would have been more costly than getting the bill later because you have had the use of the money in the interim."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2357.183,2360.636,The... the interest is apparently not... not charged.
2002.01-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.636,2369.863,"Unless you're... unless you're a company that had bought a company which, which had that switch pulled, in which case you're... you're out of pocket a good deal."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.415,2387.373,And the... the key factor that such transactions play in this particular industry may well explain why you don't see any companies on this side of the case.
2002.01-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.198,2443.32,"But there is... I mean, Congress did provide that if you think you were assigned people who belonged to someone else, you can complain and then there's an adjustment long after the 1993--"
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2443.32,2443.501,--Yes.
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.058,2461.674,"--But isn't... isn't it true that with regard to the as... with regard to as of language that Justice Scalia is emphasizing, isn't it true that those post-October changes are made as of the October date?"
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2461.674,2464.51,"--The reassignment provisions, yes."
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.78,2474.781,"No, but at least the cancellation of... of an assignment would be made as of the earlier date even though it took later... took place later."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2474.781,2475.365,--That's right.
2002.01-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.63,2481.332,So... so you... you admit that that language doesn't really mean what it says.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.332,2481.819,"--Oh, no."
2002.01-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.473,2498.184,"If you can do it with a reassignment, why can't you do it with an initial assignment?"
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2498.184,2498.951,Because there's--
2002.01-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.951,2500.137,Without doing violence to the language?
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2500.137,2502.907,--Because there's a specific exception that allows reassignments.
2002.01-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2526.575,2534.973,"But Congress didn't think so, at least the Congress that made an appropriation so that the... the administration could get the job done."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.686,2538.144,Yes.
2002.01-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.144,2543.921,And part of it was supposed to be spent to enable the administration to finish the job.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.921,2545.972,"Yes, part of it."
2002.01-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2555.3,2559.503,"I thought that supplemental appropriation was made after October 1st, 1993."
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2559.503,2560.402,"--No, before."
2002.01-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.107,2575.707,It's a little hard for me to accept your argument that the equitable structure of the statute is enhanced because the commissioner didn't get his work done on time.
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2575.707,2578.166,"Well, I think the commissioner did get the work done on time."
2002.01-705,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2620.942,2622.541,"How... how do we know this, Mr. Roberts?"
2002.01-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2637.374,2639.127,--I think we know it primarily... no.
2002.01-705,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2687.134,2688.185,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2690.252,2702.65,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-705,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.048,2732.058,"Which one are you reading from, Mr. Sutton?"
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2732.058,2732.721,--The Bellaire--
2002.01-705,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.721,2734.547,"I know, but where on the page?"
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2734.547,2739.701,"--A19, 9706(a), section (a), 9706(a)."
2002.01-705,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.701,2739.945,"Oh, thank you."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2739.945,2744.713,"And the... the first point you notice is the shall before October 1st, 1993 language."
2002.01-705,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2779.34,2782.625,"No, but... I mean, that... that's an assumption we can't make."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2803.108,2809.355,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I'm not aware of a case from this Court that has said one word in one sentence can have different meanings in the statute."
2002.01-705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.355,2809.844,It doesn't have different meanings.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2823.3,2823.903,And the point--
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.903,2829.087,"And furthermore, the argument is that the shall merely enhances and makes more meaningful the other shalls."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2829.704,2830.934,"--Well, there's just one shall."
2002.01-705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.302,2840.41,--Because it's a... look.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2854.368,2861.966,"--Well, the consequence here... and that's what makes this an easy case... is the fact that unlike Pierce County, the statute did provide a consequence."
2002.01-705,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.795,2867.994,"Well, it provided... it had a default provision."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2917.886,2927.593,"The proof, Your Honor, that this was not that mysterious in terms of language is the fact that the commissioner had no problem doing what... just what we say the statute required."
2002.01-705,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2943.206,2945.216,"Well, she could have done that if she had done absolutely nothing at all."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2966.971,2967.305,"--Well, no."
2002.01-705,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2969.248,2969.417,No.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2969.417,2971.336,"There's no doubt, you would have required a congressional fix."
2002.01-705,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2972.08,2973.695,But there would have been a result as of October 1st.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2973.695,2979.685,"--But the point I'm making is there were only 5,000 out of these 80,000 miners that they ran out of time on."
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.246,2990.373,"Yes, but the unassigned pool wasn't created just for that purpose."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2994.941,2998.73,"--But to use Justice Souter's words, all default provisions cover everything."
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.561,3004.675,But you would agree that the default position was not just to take care of the timing problem.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3004.675,3005.402,"No, of course, not."
2002.01-705,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3006.835,3014.786,"The universe... the universe of assigned and unassigned was, I don't think, intended by Congress to include people that the commissioner didn't get around to."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3014.786,3021.289,"--Well, there's one thing that Congress clearly appreciated, and let's make sure we're... I... I make this clear."
2002.01-705,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3050.744,3051.871,Can you give me that number again?
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3058.662,3061.853,"--20,000 were initially decided."
2002.01-705,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3079.558,3084.465,"So we're talking about 20,000, and... and what's the total universe that we're talking about here of unassigned?"
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3084.465,3087.328,"Oh, well, they started with 80,000 altogether."
2002.01-705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3109.556,3109.763,All right.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3128.179,3129.375,"But, Your Honor, I mean--"
2002.01-705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.375,3131.163,And why weren't they are on the other side of the case?
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3132.663,3133.396,"--Well, that's an important question."
2002.01-705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.587,3141.709,"Yes, that's my understanding."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3145.574,3146.924,Because of the cushion.
2002.01-705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3146.924,3147.513,And I'm just curious why they're not here.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3147.513,3148.189,"The cushion, Your Honor."
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.762,3168.173,"Yes, but it isn't assumed it will always be sufficient, is it?"
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3177.595,3182.793,"--Your Honor, the Government all the time relies on much less reliable proxies than this one."
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.384,3202.047,"Well, do you not agree... I'm not sure you're responding to my question."
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3210.638,3216.352,"--I don't know, and the reason I don't know is that you... these AML transfers have done the job."
2002.01-705,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3220.255,3221.709,Where would that money go?
2002.01-705,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3221.709,3223.311,Assume there is a significant risk.
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.311,3224.892,But they haven't eliminated the unassigned pool.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3224.892,3226.413,"No, they haven't."
2002.01-705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.48,3229.956,And the question is who... who should pay for those?
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3229.956,3235.813,And the rough justice calculation that the Congress made is we're going to do it on a pro rata basis.
2002.01-705,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3259.036,3263.471,Suppose the Secretary had gotten around to only half instead of what it was.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3263.471,3263.964,Right.
2002.01-705,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3263.964,3270.952,You're saying she couldn't... she... she should not have tried to make it perfect.
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3283.385,3284.569,There's... there's... I'm sorry.
2002.01-705,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3298.207,3307.879,"When you say it would fall off, do you mean that in that event, if she had been slower than she was, then she would have been permitted to make assignments after the deadline?"
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3307.879,3309.995,"--No, Your Honor, I don't mean to be saying that."
2002.01-705,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.101,3311.851,"Well, what would have happened?"
2002.01-705,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3317.334,3322.421,"--Well, the bigger problem would have been the assigned miners and they wouldn't have had enough money to pay for them."
2002.01-705,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3343.438,3346.23,I thought the first 3 years they got the money from the pension fund.
