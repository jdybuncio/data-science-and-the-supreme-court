1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.805,"Next case on for argument is number 678, Nash against the United States."
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,28.646,33.367,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,96.111,102.013,What would have happened to this reserve if they have liquidated Mr. Apolinsky?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,102.013,103.973,If the partnership had liquidated --
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,103.973,109.302,They just liquidated it would've -- would it have gone into ordinary income then?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,109.302,126.079,"No, Your Honor, under the partnership concept, liquidating to the various partners, each would have taken his pro rata part of the receivable with the reserve and it would not have come into the income of the partners."
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,126.079,128.36,It wouldn't have entered the transaction at all?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,128.36,129.376,No sir.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.842,138.787,"He should have taken his pro rata part of the receivables plus -- and his pro rata part of the reserve, is that right?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,138.787,139.422,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.422,144.326,"The partnership probably has to report as an entity, it isn’t a taxable entity basically?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,144.326,144.889,That’s right.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,144.889,146.725,It’s a group of individuals?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,146.725,160.286,"That's right and in this situation, this partnership operated 10 finance businesses, two in South Carolina and eight in Alabama."
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.027,640.935,"What would be the, under your theory your client's partners should not have added back into their income the amount there before set up as a reserve for bad debt and what would be the result vis-à-vis the newly created corporation?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,640.935,645.002,We would say the result is what did happen in our situation.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.16,652.321,Which was identical?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,652.321,653.441,Identical.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.441,653.667,"In amount, I mean."
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,653.667,654.834,It's open.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.87,682.384,"And you say, don’t take it into the income of the partnership and don't give the corporation a deduction on its first year?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,682.384,682.857,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.857,702.622,"And I suppose also the basis of the stock received by the partners in return for the transfer of the partnership assets would be reduced, it would be a net, it would be the amount of assets represented by the accounts receivable less the reserve would it not?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,702.622,703.102,That’s right.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.102,703.931,It will be a net figure.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,703.931,704.383,The net figure.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,704.383,718.528,"And that -- so the basis in the hands -- of the stock in the hands of the partners would be lowered, therefore on any subsequent sale or taxable transfer, their capital gain would be higher, is that right?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,718.528,718.908,That's right.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.908,719.802,Is that what would follow?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,719.802,719.948,Yes.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.948,720.486,In your theory.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,720.486,721.658,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.658,724.728,And the corporation would never get a deduction.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,724.728,725.855,"For that $73,000.00."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.855,728.09,"For that $73,000.00 in the first year or any other time?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,728.09,729.314,Or any other year.
1969.678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.314,734.881,"Because on this year, they haven’t paid anything for that $73,000.00 worth of accounts receivable."
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,734.881,738.197,"That's right, that it was just a mere change in form."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.247,796.457,I take it the Government would take the same position as the corporation that paid the partner's cash for the accounts receivable in their face amount less the amount of the reserve.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,796.457,800.333,If they pay the partner's cash in the face amount?
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.333,808.568,"If they just bought -- if they bought the accounts receivable, paid cash in the face amount less the $73,000.00."
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,808.568,838.767,"They would take -- well, that’s a difficult question to immediately answer for this reason, they would say that if you had a non -- if you had a taxable sale of the receivables at net, face amount less the reserve that under -- that there is no income because they seek to offset a return of the reserve to income by a loss on the receivables."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.24,897.112,"Do you think it’s different then if it's a corporation and the partners had in valuing the assets to be transferred and specifically allocated a value to the accounts receivable, the face amount less the amount of the reserve?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,897.112,899.842,Their result would not be any different.
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.842,904.903,Even though the corporation didn't purport to pay you any more than the net amount?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,904.903,917.366,"Had the corporation instead of turning up a reserve simply established on its books receivables at the net amount of $414,000.00, the net amount, their answer would have been the same."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.366,919.305,They still think you have realized income?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,919.305,921.127,They still think we realized income.
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.917,950.233,I might test your position from another angle.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,973.614,977.937,"This is what would happen, Mr. Justice Burger."
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,985.421,990.261,"Would it be charged all of the bad debt loss, the reserve would go into income then wouldn’t it?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,990.261,992.359,Would go into income by the corporation.
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,992.359,1001.059,"And this hasn't happened and never will happen unless some fairy godmother comes along and buys these at 100 cents on the dollar, isn’t that right?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1001.059,1028.288,"That's right, and if that happened quite soon after the incorporation, I think the Commissioner would come in and say the reserve wasn't reasonable in amount and would probably seek to have the partnership pay some income tax on it because if the reserve is not reasonable, he’s got other rules that they would apply and we would not argue with it but in our situation, it stipulated that the reserve is reasonable."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.288,1040.497,"If somebody talked to the -- the accounts receivable would have at their face amount and not for that amount, you would realize income?"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1040.497,1041.833,We would realize income.
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.122,1045.656,Not that you would have to do --
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1045.656,1055.968,"That's right, we would say that the tax benefit rule which the Government espouses in their brief correctly but doesn’t apply, would apply."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.137,1083.176,That reserve really just makes you a tax basis taxpayer with the amount of that reserve.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1085.648,1094.005,"If you collect those accounts in, then you do have -- in other words, you have a recovery of the reserve."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.147,1163.697,"But at least that there is some recovery in this reserve account, the result of your position of being a corporation that would pay a corporate --"
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1163.697,1164.416,That's right.
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.416,1169.576,-- tax rate rather than you would have called it paying individual.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1169.576,1180.823,"Well, you would pay a -- you would not have an immediate recognition at the beginning where you could have a higher rate or you could have a lower rate I imagine."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.459,1190.63,What’s the result of the government's position?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1209.952,1213.016,"That's right, you see what would happen, we would take it --"
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.016,1217.038,Does the Government conceive that?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1217.038,1219.836,I don't -- we really not put it to --
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.836,1222.729,You mean the tax would then have been paid on those accounts receivable?
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1222.729,1240.916,"If we had to take -- if the partners took the $73,000.00 worth of receivables into income, then they would -- they say in their brief that the corporation would then be entitled to set up a $73,000.00 reserve for bad debts in its first year."
1969.678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.909,1258.049,Tax has already been paid on it.
1969.678,0,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,1258.049,1265.537,"That's right, it’s been paid but you could have -- if you had a second deduction under their theory you could have a second tax to pay on it."
1969.678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.527,1296.97,"Very well, Mr. Apolinsky."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1298.66,1301.715,Mr. Chief Justice and may it --
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1301.715,1315.718,"Before you get underway, would you clarify perhaps for all of us but at least for me, what has changed here in your judgment by this transfer except the form and structure of doing business?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1315.718,1324.033,"That is precisely all that has changed Mr. Chief Justice, just the form in which the business is carried on."
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1324.033,1326.007,There's no change in substance?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1326.007,1351.01,"That's correct although as we pointed out in our brief, Section 351 transfers can apply where an entire business becomes a corporation or where a single asset on account receivable or any other single asset is transferred from an individual or partnership to a controlled corporation."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1351.01,1354.637,What goodness has this partnership engaged in?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1354.637,1359.266,"It was engaged in the business of financing, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1359.266,1360.544,Lending money?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1360.544,1363.102,I believe so.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1363.102,1371.766,Is it a challenge to the question as to the amount they have tried to set aside for bad debt?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1371.766,1373.011,"No, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1403.861,1408.465,But why did that change the situation with reference to the reasonableness of the amount?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1408.465,1427.147,"Well, we think that when a partnership terminates or when an entity terminates, the tax benefit principle requires that a deduction be restored to income because subsequent events have demonstrated that that entity is not entitled to the deduction."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1427.147,1429.715,Does the record show that?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1430.705,1442.654,"Well, if the partnership and corporation are considered to be separate entities, I don’t think there can be much question that the partnership’s need for the reserve ended."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1449.963,1452.204,They had changed their --
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1452.204,1453.843,The form of the business as the Chief Justice asked.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1453.843,1457.311,-- in form from a partnership to a corporation?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1457.311,1471.733,That’s correct and Mr. Apolinsky this morning and in his brief has relied heavily on the legislative history of Section 351 which provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.478,1532.498,"No, but it's reported to be transferring reserves."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1532.498,1533.873,They are transferring only the receivables.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.873,1545.383,All that it's saying is that they're transferring the accounts receivable at face amount less the amount of the reserve.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1555.742,1570.211,"Yes, but Section 351 only prohibits the recognition of gain or loss and restoring the reserve income under the tax benefit principle is not a recognition of gain or loss."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.211,1571.377,That may be so.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1571.377,1583.395,"Well, there’s no -- I think the point is Mr. Justice White that there is no provision in the statute that precludes the application of the tax benefit principle in this case."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.317,1600.431,"Well, just because there’s nothing in the statute doesn't -- that suggests the application of the tax benefit principle doesn’t agree."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1603.947,1608.298,"I would respectfully disagree, Mr. Justice White."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.298,1613.595,What possible then it has -- has come out of this transfer to the partners?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1613.595,1620.867,They have received -- the partnership has received the benefit of a deduction to which they are no longer entitled.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.867,1630.54,They received the benefit of it because the Government agreed that the accounts receivable of the books weren't all collected?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1637.966,1640.224,That is correct.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.224,1647.579,And that we are no longer entitled to view this bundle of accounts receivable worth less than the face?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1647.579,1647.983,That's right.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.886,1657.52,What's so attractive about that?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1664.958,1667.612,I don't know if there's anything attractive about it.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.291,1680.698,What possible double deduction can anybody ever get?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1680.698,1695.401,"Well, the concern we have initially, Mr. Justice White is that a deduction will be granted to the partnership as it was here and then that it will pay second deduction will be granted to the transferee corporation."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.401,1701.475,(Inaudible)
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1701.475,1707.32,I think they would try not to Mr. Justice White but I don’t think we can rule out that possibility.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.485,1719.994,"Because the corporation might have taken in, in fact that’s when it must make sure to charge somebody else more than it should."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1719.994,1722.269,"No, I don’t think that's the case."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.135,1730.276,"It was unsure, I guess?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1730.276,1731.167,Right.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.167,1737.427,By taxing someone on some income that they haven't received yet and are --
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1737.427,1740.73,"Well, we say they have received it Mr. Justice White."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.73,1745.622,That's only my picture of the full basis accounting anywhere?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1745.622,1750.665,But the deduction for a reserve for bad debts is a fiction too.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.787,1752.972,This isn't fiction at all.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1770.412,1773.401,"That's right but nevertheless, there is a recovery."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.675,1786.252,In case that the -- if the corporation had never taken place --
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1786.252,1786.671,That’s right.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.671,1794.99,"-- the partners would never pay the nickel on that $73,000.00 unless they had actually collected some of those accounts receivable."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1803.84,1804.306,That's correct.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.306,1805.134,And they never will.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1805.134,1808.02,That's correct.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.15,1843.286,We've -- we've held that here?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1843.286,1860.721,"You haven't held it but such holdings as they are, are consistent with that and petitioners conceived that in their brief that on a liquidation of a corporation, there is a restoration of the reserve to income."
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.721,1873.049,"Mr. Zinn, when this transfer occurred, I assume that in the eight offices of the corporation and partnership later the corporation, they had typewriters, desks, chairs and a lot of office equipment."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1904.352,1913.32,"No, we would not Mr. Chief Justice but that is because Section 1245 and Section 1250 of the Code specifically so provide."
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.32,1925.446,"Well, but the function of the bad debt loss is essentially in principle the same as the function of a depreciation for obsolescence isn’t it?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1925.446,1933.3,They are similar although some of the cases that we have cited including the West Seattle Bank case draw a distinction between the two.
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1956.658,1974.459,"But that isn't necessarily true as a matter of reality, in a period of rising costs, it frequently occurs that assets long since depreciated down to zero become worth a great deal and then the Government on liquidation recovers that, do they not?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1974.459,1984.804,I agree that they would and I think that they would recover it here but for the fact that we have specific statutory provisions that apply.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2035.371,2043.007,"Is your argument based on the fact, somehow somebody didn't put down there what they had intended?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2043.007,2043.421,"No, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2043.421,2052.063,And that the Government is going to get this payment although it shouldn't have it but nevertheless the letter of the law doesn’t allow it?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2052.063,2061.617,"Well, our position here is that the Internal Revenue Code doesn’t tell us which way to handle this double deduction problem."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2087.481,2102.488,"Well, is it your position that in all truth and fact and justice that this is not going to require a taxpayer to pay taxes on income that he did not receive as income?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2102.488,2103.614,"Yes, but when he --"
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2103.614,2104.551,You admit that?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2104.551,2108.421,"Yes, but when he obtained the deduction for the reserve for bad debts Mr. Justice Black --"
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2108.421,2113.227,But he will have to pay income tax on income that he did not get.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2113.227,2121.617,We say he received it because he obtained a deduction when he set up the reserve for bad debts for a loss he did not suffer.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2122.082,2125.925,Then you are saying that this would be a double benefit to him?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2125.925,2126.69,No.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2145.112,2147.282,Then what happens suppose they don't collect it?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2149.464,2156.137,We think that the corporation would be entitled to take a deduction because it would have suffered the losses.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2156.137,2156.471,I take it.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2159.002,2161.615,"Yes, because it suffered the losses."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2161.615,2164.65,That's your argument as to why it's fair for the Government to pay.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2164.65,2165.298,That's right.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2187.548,2196.386,Your argument is in fact is it that the Government would get this I mean the taxpayer would be getting this reduction twice?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2196.386,2201.878,"No, our concern is that if that -- the partnership has already gotten the deduction."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2201.878,2202.659,That's right.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2204.017,2214.336,There is a possibility that the corporation will get a deduction for the same accounts receivable.
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.336,2245.586,"As I had understood your argument, Mr. Zinn, it was this that the statute itself does not explicitly tell you or the taxpayer how this situation should be handled and that your submission is that the way you handle it is a reasonable way of handling it under the statute and that that should be the end of the case and as I further understand it, neither you on the one hand, nor your adversary on the other are claiming that either, there should be double taxation or a double deduction."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2255.315,2258.822,"That’s right, which way to avoid the double deduction."
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.822,2266.623,"And as I understand it further, you’re not saying that the way you decided to handle this is the only proper way of doing it."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2272.983,2276.667,"That's correct, except that I would add to that that we think our way --"
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.667,2276.755,Is the best thing?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2276.755,2291.48,"-- is more consistent with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, particularly those of subchapter C which this Court recognized last term and Commissioner and Gordon are very, very technical."
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.48,2291.938,Yes.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2291.938,2310.692,"Now, we think that Mr. Apolinsky’s arguments are very persuasive in terms of perhaps revising the Internal Revenue Code and making Section 351 read the same way that Section 47 (b) reads that if it’s so long as the same business is continuing, no income will be recognized."
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.692,2311.409,Right.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2311.409,2313.988,But that's not what the Code says.
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2313.988,2314.265,I understand that.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.265,2325.289,But you don't claim it would be reasonable for the Government -- for taxpayer be denied this deduction twice.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2325.289,2328.187,"No, we don't seek to deny it twice, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2329.191,2332.128,"Now, do you think it would be reasonable for them to get it twice?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2332.128,2333.931,That’s correct.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2333.931,2336.724,It's just once is all the deduction they should get?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2336.724,2337.741,"Yes, and tha'’s all they seek."
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2337.741,2344.605,"And no scheme will do that whether you call it reasonable, you wouldn’t call it reasonable if it didn’t accomplish that, would you?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2344.605,2345.333,I'm not sure I follow you.
1969.678,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2345.333,2353.864,You wouldn't call it reasonable would you if it was making this taxpayer be denied of privilege over a deduction for a loss he had had.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2353.864,2354.059,Oh!
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.76,2372.305,"Neither side in this case is, your adversary is not claiming it is going to be taxed twice and you're not claiming that it's going to be deducted twice."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2372.305,2372.955,At which way?
1969.678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2372.955,2374.266,It’s just which accounting matter --
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2374.266,2375.129,Which way.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.703,2454.319,"What would you -- if someone bought from the partners the accounts receivable for cash at the net value, face less the amount of the reserve, I suppose the partners would be realize income?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2454.319,2455.819,"Well, they might realize."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.996,2467.215,Restoration?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2467.684,2470.543,"Yes, we think there would be restoration of the reserve."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.543,2473.881,"And as to the fact of the income on the $75--$73,000.00?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2473.881,2475.496,That's right.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.496,2477.777,Even if they -- nobody paid it?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2477.777,2478.529,That’s right.
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.622,2504.687,"Mr. Zinn, you may pick up where you left off."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2504.687,2507.802,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2626.681,2631.227,"Well, would you distinguish it in that respect from a depreciation reserve?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2631.227,2646.337,"No, a depreciation reserve is not property either but under Section 1016 of the Internal Revenue Code, a depreciation reserve is specifically provided to reduce the basis of the depreciable asset."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.411,2706.802,"Let’s assume that this wasn't a 351 transaction, the corporation was organized and assets were transferred to it for consideration and the corporation bought these receivables for cash."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2709.769,2710.487,That's correct.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.622,2716.562,What do you think the corporation paid for here?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2721.365,2722.513,Right.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.513,2723.763,But it did issue stock?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2723.763,2724.601,"Well, its basis would be."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.601,2726.401,And receivable?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2726.401,2728.66,But it issued stock and cash?
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.66,2730.887,"No, it issued stock and receivable."
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2730.887,2733.152,But it was a taxable transaction?
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.438,2737.891,What is that?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2737.891,2742.044,The face amount of the receivables less the reserve.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.009,2761.289,Do you think the Code requires the corporation in this kind of a transaction to take into plus the receivable to be paid?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2761.289,2766.406,I don't know if I can go so far as to say it requires Mr. Justice White.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.057,2779.217,You mean that requirement is only a requirement if you’re right under --
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2779.217,2786.88,"No, we say that the Code doesn’t specifically answer the question that’s presented here, how to avoid the double deduction."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.609,2813.594,"Basis would just be made, what does that do to the partnership?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2813.594,2829.167,"Well, the partnership, if the Court should hold that the tax benefit principle doesn't apply here, then the basis of the receivables should be reduced to net in the hands of the corporation so as to avoid a double deduction."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.167,2846.643,"What -- if you're on the buying side rather on the receiving side on the corporate side and basically under the receivables that that value was the face, how would you pay any more than the true value?"
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2846.643,2851.357,"No, you wouldn't pay more than the true value for them, you pay the net amount."
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.888,2868.624,But what you're saying is that we must -- what we should do to save the corporation is to really pay the face -- for the face value for the seizable to debt and hence the transfer in stockholders actual recipient?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2868.624,2872.372,I don't think we have to say that the corporation paid the face amount.
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.873,2908.008,This partnership could have sold and assigned accounts receivable independently of this tax free transfer couldn't they?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2908.008,2915.548,"Yes, in our position, if it had done that would be precisely what it is here that the reserve for bad debts has to be restored to income."
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2915.548,2917.059,If they sold it for the net amount?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2917.059,2935.816,"If they sold it for the net amount and if they are entitled to a loss measured by the difference between the face amount and the net amount because that is a sale of property and on a sale of property, accounts receivable with a basis of let’s say $100.00, for a net value of 90, they’re entitled to a loss of $10.00."
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.816,2937.697,Would that be a wash transaction?
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2937.697,2948.235,It would be in most cases Mr. Chief Justice because accounts receivable under Section 12214 of the Code would be an ordinary income asset.
1969.678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.967,2970.28,In here they thought of the partners that they have to take this in the income.
1969.678,1,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2976.139,2980.363,That's right because the corporation will suffer the loss.
1969.678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3026.021,3027.317,Thank you Mr. Zinn.
1969.678,2,26439,harold_i_apolinsky,,3036.31,3038.85,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.678,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3414.94,3416.32,Thank you Mr. Apolinsky.
