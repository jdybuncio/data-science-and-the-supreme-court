1975.75-510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.93,"We will hear arguments next in 75-510, Flint Ridge Development against Scenic Rivers Association and the consolidated case."
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,53.93,58.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,169.005,172.72,"But the law was more patterned on the Securities Act of 1933, wasn’t it?"
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,172.72,185.333,Yes it was Your Honor and I think that’s quite a significant point in viewing the Act because the Securities Act of 1933 really represented a choice for Congress to go two ways.
1975.75-510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.872,255.675,If only he has authority to determine.
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,255.675,256.973,That’s all he has authority to—
1975.75-510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.973,263.635,He can’t hold it up because he thinks it’s a bad deal for buyers or because he thinks it’s a bad use of the land.
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,263.635,268.266,"No, in fact the Act is explicit on that, Your Honor."
1975.75-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.254,319.984,I think there are some statements that are required in the filling that relate to the environment.
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,319.984,321.206,"Yes, they do."
1975.75-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.908,333.673,What if they just thought that some of those statements are false?
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,333.673,339.432,"Well, if anything required by the statute or regulation is false, we --"
1975.75-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.432,340.515,Who do you call in the administrator?
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,340.515,341.435,The administrator.
1975.75-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.435,344.393,How does the administrator know whether they’re false or not?
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,344.393,353.787,"Well, he has a field force which does some inspecting in connection with registrations."
1975.75-510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,369.622,370.471,Or an incomplete statement.
1975.75-510,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,370.471,376.532,Or an incomplete statement and this brings to the time limits in the statute.
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1157.486,1162.537,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.149,1464.695,What sort of development was this?
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1464.695,1468.622,"It's a second home residential subdivision, Your Honor."
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1468.622,1471.357,In to how many units?
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1471.357,1478.364,The first -- this was the so called first phase and there was a 1014 lots in the first phase.
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1478.364,1480.898,And how many structures?
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1480.898,1485.582,The property was being sold as vacant lots to purchasers.
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1485.582,1486.277,I see.
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1486.277,1497.679,"Of course what happens in this type of a development, the developer never knows beforehand how many of the lots within the subdivision that he is going to sell with houses on them."
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1515.478,1528.704,You were talking about the timing and you said that HUD doesn’t plan any party even as a recipient until the time comes from sales and I was wondering how much is then been done.
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1532.264,1546.625,"Your Honor, it's not in the record but what is in the record is that between July of ‘73 and July of ‘74, over $3.5 million had been spent in actual construction of the development."
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1546.625,1550.169,Including sewage or septic tanks or whatever?
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1550.169,1559.482,"No these were just roads, a water treatment plant, improvements, and clubhouses, those types of improvements."
1975.75-510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1559.482,1560.783,But not the individual units?
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1560.783,1564.995,Not the individual units.
1975.75-510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.58,1598.616,"The developer has expended all of his money to roads, clubhouses and other facilities at his own peril."
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1598.616,1602.1,Well if you use the term peril--
1975.75-510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.1,1609.954,In the sense that he doesn’t know what the ultimate consequence is going to be for the project.
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1609.954,1613.825,Is Your Honor talking about when you say at his peril --
1975.75-510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1613.825,1616.505,"It has been held up now, I take it."
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1616.505,1620.797,That’s correct but we say erroneously so.
1975.75-510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1620.797,1623.327,I'm talking about but the hard reality.
1975.75-510,1,24696,f_paul_thieman_jr,,1623.327,1632.216,"Yes, we have been held -- I’d like to save the balance of my time for rebuttal."
1975.75-510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.216,1638.494,Very well.
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1638.494,1642.237,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.75-510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.453,1793.067,Do you suggest that the environmental impact statement which you think should be filed will bear at all on the decision by the administrator with respect to the filing?
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1793.067,1798.181,It could very well provide information with respect to the accuracy of the filing.
1975.75-510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.836,1814.726,"I take it you would -- I take it you would be here, however, even if the filing required nothing at all with respect to the environment."
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1818.459,1821.734,Yes sir.
1975.75-510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.011,1868.103,What was the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in the Zabel case?
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1868.103,1886.01,Simply that the National Environmental Policy Act in particularly 101 provides substantive authority to the agency involved and consider environmental matters and could reduce or suspend or prevent a permit on environmental grounds.
1975.75-510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.01,1905.168,"Was that consistent with your first SCRAP opinion in which we said that the NEPA does not alter or amend any other statutory provision and here you do have a statutory provision, don’t you think that the administration doesn’t express any position on the merits."
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1905.168,1911.092,"I don’t think it's a matter of amendment, I think it's a matter of an enlargement giving the agency one more thing to consider."
1975.75-510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.092,1915.75,What was the argument in first SCRAP and was rejected by this Court?
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1915.75,1919.299,"Well, I don’t myself understand SCRAP to mean that."
1975.75-510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.36,1940.841,"The opinion said something along the line, it said it didn’t amend any other statutes, did it?"
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1940.841,1943.706,Yes sir.
1975.75-510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.706,1945.983,That’s the language to which my brother was referring to.
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,1945.983,1947.625,Yes sir.
1975.75-510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.543,2257.638,The federal action as --
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2257.638,2258.839,The major federal action?
1975.75-510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.839,2261.88,What is the major federal action?
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2261.88,2270.499,"Well, the federal action to begin is the giving of permission to sell in interstate commerce as the result of a filing."
1975.75-510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.748,2325.813,But what if the federal action consisted only in carrying some of the correspondence of this developer in the United States mails and yet the development was absolutely mammoth and had a tremendous impact on the environment and there was federal action that was essential to get his financing from the New York bankers.
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2331.398,2334.944,"Well, I'm not certain that’s a federal action in terms of a --"
1975.75-510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2334.944,2341.167,"It’s essential for getting his financing without carrying it in United States mails, is that not possible to be accomplished?"
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2341.167,2347.167,If we assume hypothetically that there is a statute which requires the use of the United States mails to send --
1975.75-510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.167,2358.376,"No just in fact that this was sent in the mails, and you have the present legislation, and you have the present language of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2358.376,2361.159,And they utilized the mails to mail documents to bankers and so --
1975.75-510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.159,2363.595,To get the financing.
1975.75-510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2363.595,2365.268,And to solicit sales.
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2365.268,2382.857,"And to solicit sales, I think probably in that situation you may have nothing, I believe nothing which would result in degradation substantially because of federal involvement although I can see, I can see in the --"
1975.75-510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.857,2385.144,"Well, you have in mind the facts of my hypothetical."
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2385.144,2385.638,Sir?
1975.75-510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.638,2387.7,You have in mind that --
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2387.7,2389.433,"Yes sir, if that’s a necessary --"
1975.75-510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.433,2391.825,The financing -- financing wouldn’t be possible but without --
1975.75-510,2,15874,andrew_t_dalton,,2391.825,2392.53,Fine.
1975.75-510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.683,2406.534,"To every construction in the country, doesn’t it?"
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3351.215,3355.927,"One very brief point, Your Honor."
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.97,3383.568,Does the regulation require the disclosure of any environmental facts at all?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3383.568,3385.522,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.989,3399.309,Are they in the papers we have?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3399.309,3401.975,"They are in the papers, you have to Code of Federal Regulations."
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.064,3416.968,1710.105?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3416.968,3418.435,1710.105.
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.913,3454.885,What statute bears on this if any?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3454.885,3461.768,"In the statute, specifically that the 12 items that are specifically required to be included in --"
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.768,3462.906,And you have it in your brief?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3462.906,3464.744,This is the appendix to the brief.
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.518,3471.306,At the 5 (a) or --?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3471.306,3479.573,"At 4 (a) or 5 (a) it’s Section 1406 on page 5 (a), it’s 15 U.S.C. 1705 --"
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.573,3480.654,Where is that subsection?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3480.654,3494.406,"And it’s subsections -- subsection 2 which requires a description of topography and subsection 3, we’ll, that's the title."
1975.75-510,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3507.062,3509.865,That’s kind of environment from the purchaser’s point of view?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3509.865,3512.411,"Yes, which is the purpose of the statute, Your Honor."
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.485,3536.756,(Voice Overlap) the disclosure as this is very noisy?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3536.756,3541.157,"They could disclose it’s noisy, they could disclose that the development is under water --"
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.157,3542.773,And terrible drainage?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3542.773,3543.122,That’s right.
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3547.096,3550.923,These clients must come in and act on that statement?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3550.923,3551.913,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3551.913,3554.587,The --Not to expect the HUD to do the impact statement.
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3554.587,3557.981,I’m sorry.
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3557.981,3560.444,And not expect HUD.
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3560.444,3561.541,To do the impact statement.
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3569.743,3586.834,"If we look at this page -- this data and found that asserted that there were false statements and the noise was greater than disclosed, that the drainage was not as good as it is disclosed, then what would they do about it?"
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3586.834,3587.1,Then --
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3587.1,3589.03,To do their remedy?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3589.03,3597.546,"As long as they were not purchasers, their only remedy would be to complain to HUD and to the Attorney General alleging that there had been violations to the Act and the regulations."
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3597.546,3599.382,"Well, would they intend to do that?"
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3599.382,3602.326,"Well, they could at least write a complaint in as any citizen can."
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3605.172,3609.805,"The matter is between the registrat and HUD, isn’t it?"
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3609.805,3612.014,"Well, the purchaser also has certainly."
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.022,3630.851,"How about the thousand people who owned homes around the perimeter, out of the development area?"
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3630.851,3638.188,"Their remedy would only be to go to HUD and say, you ought to have better regulations and petition for better regulations which is at these --"
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3638.188,3641.623,"No standing, you think in any --"
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3641.623,3642.464,In any legal proceeding.
1975.75-510,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.464,3643.492,Legal proceedings.
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3643.492,3644.361,That is right.
1975.75-510,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3644.361,3649.594,Is the filing of a deliberately false statement by a developer subject to criminal liability?
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3649.594,3650.618,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1975.75-510,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3650.618,3655.112,"Well, I supposed anyone can write to the criminal division or the US Attorney and say --"
1975.75-510,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3655.112,3657.071,Anybody can be uninformed.
1975.75-510,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3657.071,3657.903,"That is right, Your Honor."
