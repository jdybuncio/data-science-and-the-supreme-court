1975.74-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.127,We will hear arguments next in United States against MacCOLLOM.
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,48.119,51.977,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,170.851,179.158,Did the District Court consider this underlying pleading as one filed under 2255 of Title 28?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,179.158,181.938,The District Court did not state how it was considering the complaint.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.809,198.98,Court never explicitly --
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,198.98,199.721,Court never explicitly --
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.721,200.462,-- set out those grounds?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,200.462,202.462,-- set out those grounds.
1975.74-1487,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,202.462,205.85,"Mr. Easterbrook, is the respondent on parole now?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,205.85,208.299,"Yes, he is."
1975.74-1487,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,208.299,209.935,Is he working?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,209.935,211.592,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1975.74-1487,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,211.592,216.54,Maybe I should ask your opposition whether he is still indigent?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,219.012,220.77,We do not believe that it has become moot.
1975.74-1487,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,233.66,235.794,"Well, if he is employed, it might not be."
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,235.794,236.202,That is correct.
1975.74-1487,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,236.202,237.575,"At least, we are not brought up to date."
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,237.575,239.036,We are not up to date.
1975.74-1487,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,246.528,250.917,"(Inaudible) transcript would cost, how likely it would be?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,250.917,255.102,"The transcript is a transcript of a two-day trial, Your Honor."
1975.74-1487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,260.903,263.098,The stenographic minutes are still available?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,263.098,269.212,"The stenographic minutes are still available, although they have not been transcribed."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,492.351,502.219,"There is no statute explicitly dealing with this subject in Federal habeas corpus, in Federal habeas corpus, you say it is a case law?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,502.219,507.948,Section 753 (f) says that you can obtain a transcript without charge in habeas corpus cases.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.144,523.044,"As far as the statute goes, it just says that you can obtain it?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,523.044,526.951,That is right.
1975.74-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,639.027,644.532,"(Inaudible) direct appeal, none under the Criminal Justice Act, he would have gotten a complete transcript --"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,644.532,645.497,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1975.74-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,645.787,646.827,-- or as much as was necessary?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,646.827,649.825,"-- as much as was necessary, that is the very first way."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.713,697.913,"Before you proceed, the same rule would be constitutionally required in any state appeal?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,697.913,701.731,This Court has held that it is required in state appeals.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.731,710.807,"I do not know that there is a decision analogous to the Hardy case in state courts, but a roughly equivalent --"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,710.807,712.06,"Yes, roughly equivalent."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.437,718.902,(Voice Overlap) and its progeny?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,718.902,721.341,I think so Your Honor.
1975.74-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.938,805.368,"Under the Court of Appeals' opinion would not make any difference, whether the post-conviction relief sought was 2 years, 5 years or 10 years -- (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,805.368,814.175,"Not at all, Your Honor, not at all, as long as the person was still in custody for purposes of 2255, in Court of Appeals' view would require the preparation of the transcript."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.547,838.49,"Well, except, you concede that the statute provides it, that even if it is 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 18 years, 23 years, that if he shows a need, then he is entitled to the transcript?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,838.49,849.258,"That is correct, Your Honor, but there would be some difficulties, we think, under the Court of Appeals rule, if the transcript could not be prepared and there were no established need for it."
1975.74-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,861.824,870.104,"The Court of Appeals (Inaudible) whether it is 2 years or 20 years or 30, they need show no reason for the need?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,870.104,871.186,No.
1975.74-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,872.388,873.854,No demonstration at all?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,873.854,876.292,"That is correct, no demonstration at all is required."
1975.74-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.292,890.539,"Is there an implicit limitation in the Court of Appeals holding, at least reserving the question of whether if the reporter had died, his notes were unavailable and a transcript simply could not be prepared."
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,895.732,907.08,"The Court of Appeals did not specifically address that question, Your Honor, as indeed it did not have to because a transcript could be prepared in this case if that is necessary and I think that question is still fairly open to litigation in the Ninth Circuit."
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.5,929.381,"Mr. Easterbrook, supposing in his motion, he had alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective in that he had failed to make objections to the admissibility of evidence from time to time during the trial, that competent counsel would normally make, would he be entitled to a transcript?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,929.381,937.64,"It is our position that under those circumstances, that would probably not state a claim for relief, even if supported by the transcript."
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,977.161,1003.575,"But if the only error goes to the confidence of counsel, perhaps, I should change the example to make it a little stronger, that he did not make projections which any trained lawyer would make, you know, the standard is framed differently in different circuits, but assuming you have met in conclusionary terms the standard, how can you charge him with a failure to appeal, if he relies exclusively on the advice of the man he now says is incompetent, but did not realize at the time his was incompetent?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1003.575,1009.99,There might be some reason to inquire whether part of the incompetence dealt with failure to pursue the appeal.
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.79,1040.93,"And I take that that would not be sufficient, if it were merely stated as a conclusion?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1040.93,1049.327,"If it were just simply stated as the conclusion here, that is my counsel was ineffective, it truly would not be sufficient."
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.695,1062.782,In theory he alleges that he was so ineffective that the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right was violated?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1062.782,1067.972,If that is the only conclusion that is no adequate to require a trial transcript.
1975.74-1487,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1192.712,1204.165,How do you get around the possibility that the jailhouse lawyers' use automatically ask for the transcript for appeal purposes?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1204.165,1204.412,That may well --
1975.74-1487,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1204.412,1206.81,(Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1206.81,1209.471,It may be that that is what would happen.
1975.74-1487,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.986,1256.005,(Inaudible) I said he would ask for the transcript and then would not go through with the appeal?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1256.005,1262.376,"In that event, he must face the consequent claim of deliberate bypass."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.452,1295.637,"As suggested by the colloquy with my brother Marshall, there is a time limitation on appeal and there is none in collateral attacks, save only that the applicant must still be in custody?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1295.637,1299.799,"Yes, I agree."
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.725,1391.157,Let me just interrupt for a second.
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1397.648,1402.586,"Insofar as it rests upon the constitution Your Honor, it would necessarily determine the state practice as well."
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.586,1408.703,"Do you think a holding against you would necessarily rests on the constitution, which is what I probably should have asked?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1408.703,1421.711,"In light of the explicit provision of Congress in Section 753 (f), that there should be a showing of need and lack of frivolity, I think the decision by this Court would have to rest on the constitution."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1421.711,1426.229,We have to hold that that statue is pro tato constitutionally invalid?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1426.229,1431.295,"That is correct, to the extent that it places those two requirements upon an applicant for collateral relief."
1975.74-1487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.295,1436.18,But it did not have reach the constitutional question?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1439.931,1447.846,Court of Appeals said in a footnote that it was addressing a deficit not filled by the statute.
1975.74-1487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1467.038,1473.114,"Even though it says it did not have to reach the constitutional question in fact, it was saying that was constitutionally required?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1473.114,1474.193,That is correct.
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.169,1490.411,"Id it possible Mr. Easterbrook to hold that an adequate showing of need, within the meaning of the statute, is made by an allegation that the petitioner was not afforded effective assistance of the counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1490.411,1491.614,Without more?
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.614,1496.628,"Without more! Would not that be, at least, a theoretically permissible way of deciding the case without reaching the constitution --"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1496.628,1499.723,I believe that would be a theoretically permissible way to decide the case.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1541.478,1558.297,"Because here the statutory condition is not that the suit be not frivilous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal, but it really, by a trial judgeâ€™s or a circuit judgeâ€™s certificate?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1558.297,1558.994,That is correct.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.994,1560.801,Whatever the facts may be?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1560.801,1561.515,That is right.
1975.74-1487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1562.121,1566.618,(Inaudible) on an allegation such as my brother Stevens suggested?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1566.618,1569.102,To the best of my knowledge that has never been litigated.
1975.74-1487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1574.874,1577.443,Do you think it could be reviewed?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1577.443,1589.119,"I would not like to foreclose our opportunity to test that, but I would say that we have never sought to review them and that ordinarily, if a trial judge or an appellant judge makes a certificate that is quite sufficient for the government."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.119,1594.935,What happens in case the district judge simply refused the request for a transcript?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1594.935,1595.761,That is correct.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.761,1595.833,Wihtout --
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1595.833,1596.981,He dismissed -- he dismissed the claim --
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.981,1598.602,Without certifying anything?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1598.602,1600.324,-- without certifying anything.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1606.598,1608.152,"An individual judge, right?"
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1608.152,1608.911,-- from any judge.
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.911,1610.243,Any judge at that?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1610.243,1616.445,He did not do that because it was his intention to establish the principle that he had an automatic right to a transfer and so he appealed the --
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.445,1618.383,He appealed the dismissal?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1618.383,1619.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.0,1621.127,And that was part of the case in the Court of Appeals.
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1621.127,1621.61,Court of Appeals decided --
1975.74-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1621.61,1623.241,There is no allegation of any seperate charge?
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1623.241,1624.301,None to any circuit judge.
1975.74-1487,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.854,1644.29,"Mr. Easterbrook, it is to my understanding that there are federal districts, at least there have been, in which as a matter of routine, the United States attorney automatically orders a transcript in all cases in order that they will expedite the preparation of record and shorten the period required for appeal, for disposition of the appeal."
1975.74-1487,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1647.905,1654.256,"I know that that practice is followed in a number of districts, but I think in great number of less than the majority of districts."

1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1872.642,1876.849,"I am saying that at least that combined with the Sixth Amendment, which is the case before the Court --"
1975.74-1487,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1876.849,1879.336,What was the exact language you pleaded on the Sixth Amendment?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1879.336,1890.98,"You will find that in the appendix at page 11 thru 13, the court's appendix."
1975.74-1487,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1890.98,1892.715,What is the exact language?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1892.715,1896.138,It is at the bottom of page 11.
1975.74-1487,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1911.967,1920.914,Is it possible that you can have a broader one in â€œhe denied effective assistance of the counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1920.914,1922.263,"No, I do not believe so."
1975.74-1487,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.19,1927.732,Let me ask you again.
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1935.521,1936.469,"Well, the problem is â€“"
1975.74-1487,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.469,1938.002,Yes or no?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1938.002,1940.576,The answer is yes.
1975.74-1487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.885,1989.824,I understood Mr. Easterbrooksâ€™ position to be that insufficiency of the evidence was not a ground upon to support collateral relief.
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,1994.317,1995.209,That is correct.
1975.74-1487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.209,2001.649,"But, insufficiency of the evidence is something available on appeal, but not on collateral attack."
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2003.839,2006.818,I would have a caveat to that position.
1975.74-1487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.663,2033.609,"As far as this Court's jurisprudence goes, one is a constitutional violation, the other is not?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2033.609,2074.487,"Well, I would agree with that, Mr. Justice Stewart, but the position that I am asserting is that the constitutional implications or the standard that is actually employed in reviewing the record in order to determine whether there was an insufficiency of the evidence, and the standards that are employed in order to determine the lack of evidence under the Fifth Amendment, in my experience, had been co-extensive, and so the problem is essentially partially a semantic one in that the necessity of the transcript to raise either issue is exactly the same, and whether one could raise one only on appeal, and the other properly in either appeal or post-conviction relief."
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.487,2086.475,"Is it a statutory standard or does the statute provide for the standard for review on direct appeal of the evidence, or is it a rule?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2086.475,2089.511,"No, I believe it would be case law."
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.931,2105.069,"But on collateral relief in the federal court with respect to a federal prisoner, cannot you make an allegation that the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy a statute or rule?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2105.069,2115.281,"Yes, but again I think the standard that the petitioner would bare would be exactly the same, whether you rephrase it in the constitutional or the statutory sense."
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.897,2135.89,Would not this situation here arise only where or mostly where the issue involved was not raisable on appeal?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2135.89,2138.132,"No, I do not think it necessary would."
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.981,2152.948,"If there had been appeal, there would have been a transcript, I take it?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2152.948,2157.056,"Yes, that would be correct, for all practical purposes."
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.114,2187.478,"As a practical matter, this problem would arise only when there has not been an appeal then?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2187.478,2199.868,"That is correct, and that is exactly the reason why the governmentâ€™s position herein does not address the problem which MacCOLLOM faces, which is this is his only remedy."
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.554,2229.816,It sounds as though it would hardly ever arise if it were in the case of a state prisoner?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2229.816,2231.085,It would be extremely unlikely (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.085,2235.508,Because he would have exhausted his state remedies which would include an appeal?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2235.508,2236.669,Normally that is correct.
1975.74-1487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.669,2237.902,Which would involve a transcript?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2237.902,2243.109,"That is correct; under the virtually unanimous rules of the states, which I am familiar."
1975.74-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.109,2260.221,"But how about not of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to the explanation of the right to appeal, but simply a claim limited to ineffective assistance of counsel at trial?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2262.85,2266.406,"No, that would certainly be raisable in most state court appeal proceedings."
1975.74-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.406,2267.666,In the federal court too?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2267.666,2270.619,And in a subsequent federal court proceeding.
1975.74-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.619,2273.807,I mean a direct appeal on the federal system?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2273.807,2279.348,Yes.
1975.74-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2279.348,2286.799,Are you suggesting Mr. Strait that the Court of Appeals' statement of its holding is broader than it was necessary?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2286.799,2289.06,"Very substantially, Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.073,2330.706,"Well, you say then where the Court of Appeals in the last sentence says, we hold, that is really dicta, which it may well be?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2330.706,2333.03,"That is exactly what I am asserting, yes."
1975.74-1487,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2357.131,2368.033,(Inaudible) that the Court of Appeals decided that there had been compliance with 753 (f)?
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2368.033,2384.286,"I think what the Court of Appeals confronted was the problem of other courts' interpretations of the demands of 753 (f), with particular reference to specific claims like of the Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of the counsel, and found that that was the most compliance that could be provided."
1975.74-1487,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2384.286,2393.333,"Well, can it be compliance with 753 (f), except as an application for and the certificate rendered either by a trial judge or a circuit judge?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2393.333,2397.383,"No, there would have to been a certificate and that issue (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1487,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2397.383,2405.629,"So at the very least, the Court of Appeals decision does not rest upon a holding of compliance with 753 (f)?"
1975.74-1487,1,33094,john_strait,,2405.629,2406.603,"No, I believe that is correct."
1975.74-1487,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3662.147,3666.28,I have nothing further unless the Court has questions.
1975.74-1487,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3666.28,3668.702,They are none?
