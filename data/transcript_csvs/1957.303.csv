1957.303,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.459,"Number 303, Alaska Industrial Board and Carl E. Jenkins, Petitioners, versus Chugach Electric Association, Inc."
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,22.203,25.696,May it please the Court?
1957.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,187.865,193.717,Award for permanent disabilities is not related to wages.
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,193.717,195.525,I think it does not Your Honor.
1957.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,195.525,196.743,Lump sum is it?
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,196.743,197.515,Sir?
1957.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,197.515,198.437,It's a lump sum?
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,198.437,204.774,"It's a lump sum, it's not related to wages, it has no relation -- it's not computed on wages."
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,223.286,226.368,"Well, didn't the Court of Appeals say that it was?"
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,226.368,231.327,"The court of Appeals did say that it was Your Honor, yes."
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,231.327,237.49,"I am wondering, is that -- is that an issue we have to determine here?"
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,237.49,241.561,"I don't think you have to determine that issue Your Honor, no."
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,255.367,260.173,And basically is this a question of the construction of the Alaska Act --
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,260.173,263.312,That's the case in a nutshell Your Honor.
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,263.312,263.8,Yes.
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,263.8,272.595,It's based on the construction of those two provisions of the act; the permanent scheduled award section and the temporary compensation section.
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.595,279.648,"I gather his one foot had not -- was still under treatment, was it not, that hadn't reached the point of --"
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,279.648,290.801,"Yes, after the left arm and right leg had been fitted with artificial limbs, he couldn't go back to work because the left foot wouldn't heal."
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,301.461,311.435,"So that even though perhaps with the artificial limbs he might have been able to do some limited kind of work, he was disabled by reason of the foot conditions from even doing that, is that --"
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,311.435,318.366,That's exactly our position Your Honor that he had some remaining earning capacity after he got his artificial limbs.
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,327.877,337.921,So that he should be under your view entitled a temporary compensation until a period of finality or judgment of finality as to the leg injury had been reached?
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,337.921,338.672,That's correct Your Honor.
1957.303,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,342.464,362.618,"As I understand you're saying Mr. Dimond, it was the practice under your act to pay the petitioner compensation until he was healed, and then after he was healed to make the permanent award."
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,362.618,379.53,"Generally Your Honor, the Industrial Board I think almost in every case does not decide what degree of permanent injury had been incurred until after the healing period is over, and the man has returned to work or until the doctors say there's nothing further we can do with you."
1957.303,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,379.53,381.653,Courts have sustained that --
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,381.653,399.633,"I don't think it's ever -- I did mention Your Honor that it's been the practice of the board and the courts, I don't think that question has ever come up as an issue in a case as to whether that was proper, I think that (Inaudible)."
1957.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,419.392,420.046,"Well, may I ask –-"
1957.303,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,420.046,429.067,Is there any indication here why they didn't follow that practice and wait to lose till that left foot has healed?
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,429.067,431.764,"Well Your Honor, the respondents took this position."
1957.303,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,460.21,461.42,So they quit –-
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,461.42,472.251,They paid him $8100 maximum less the amount they have paid him for temporary disability for the preceding 38 weeks.
1957.303,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,474.56,482.553,Does your statute make the loss of an arm and a leg permanent total disability?
1957.303,0,30066,john_h_dimond,,482.553,509.151,"Yes Your Honor, the statute on page 6 of the petitioner's opening brief in the appendix, that's roman numeral 6, the loss of both hands or both arms or both feet or both legs and so on shall constitute total and permanent disability and be compensated according to the provisions of the act with reference to total and permanent disability."
1957.303,1,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,1907.093,1912.657,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1957.303,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1929.775,1931.189,You did not having the cross-petition?
1957.303,1,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,1931.189,1943.792,We did not cross-petition before a writ and the point I would first like to raise is the question of jurisdiction.
1957.303,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2003.416,2009.039,"What claim was presented within his agreement, the claim of injury?"
1957.303,1,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,2009.039,2030.933,"Nothing Mr. Justice Douglas except the petitioner's original application and amended application both of which were adjudicated, awards were made, awards were paid and no appeal was taken."
1957.303,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2042.591,2044.738,Can they decide where (Inaudible)?
1957.303,1,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,2044.738,2048.264,"On the jurisdictional matter, yes they do."
1957.303,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2049.513,2053.067,You say jurisdiction is art and parcel of the claim.
1957.303,1,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,2053.067,2055.188,Right.
1957.303,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2130.439,2137.259,You insist on – you trying to set aside (Inaudible)
1957.303,1,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,2137.259,2161.369,"Well, it would go to the whole judgment Justice Douglas, because we've consistently maintained from the start of this case, that is before the Industrial Board hearing on January 8th of 54, and then in the District Court and again, in the Court of Appeals."
1957.303,2,30066,john_h_dimond,,2937.7,2938.899,I think the –-
1957.303,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2938.899,2982.822,The question I want to put you is would you be good enough to be more specific in answering (Inaudible) My difficulty as you see is how (Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,2982.822,2988.329,I found it.
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2988.329,2998.322,In (Inaudible) -- would you say that is the fair characterization of the issue of the (Inaudible) court's opinion below?
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,2998.322,2998.505,I –-
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2998.505,3007.178,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3007.178,3011.372,"No, I don't believe that's correct Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I don't --"
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3011.372,3016.442,Would you mind telling us (Inaudible) why isn't correct?
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3016.442,3032.229,Because the scheduled awards for permanent partial or permanent total under the Alaska Act are in lieu of earning capacity.
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3032.229,3034.796,"(Inaudible) determination to be made, isn't it?"
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3046.765,3047.732,I –-
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3047.732,3053.684,If you say this (Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3053.684,3057.918,"Well, I believe that the whole basic concept of Workmen's Compensation --"
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3057.918,3058.793,Generally --
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3058.793,3059.444,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3059.444,3086.704,Yes now the question is whether this specialized legislation (Inaudible) Compensation act in many ways and the question is whether that general concept infuses this specialized formulation of the Workmen Compensation (Inaudible) isn't that really (Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3086.704,3090.718,Yes!
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3126.916,3174.671,Now I think it's relevant to ask you this what is there either or (Inaudible) of the statue all provisions that (Inaudible) include all act legislative history that (Inaudible) that the manner in which the (Inaudible) provision was drawn would cause (Inaudible) having due regard to the way Workmen Compensation Act is to be construed that the Alaska act did not mean (Inaudible) and clean it all after one payment when there is (Inaudible).
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3210.585,3214.412,"Well, I think I will have to answer your question in two parts."
1957.303,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3228.837,3232.315,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3232.315,3253.884,"Well, that again brings in one of the basic concepts of Workmen's comp that the common law tort is replaced by this absolute right to gain certain specified and specific payments for injuries arising out of employment."
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3253.884,3276.042,"(Inaudible) that the fact that it's compounded into so many dollars and cents, the regular (Inaudible) so many dollars and so many whatever it is (Inaudible) so many dollars have been added to those, here is a fixed amount -- withdraw the whole matter from any further litigation, is that what you are saying?"
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3276.042,3281.295,"No Mr. Justice Frankfurter, there is two ways of looking at these lump sum payments."
1957.303,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3321.582,3343.244,"How can you equate it to the payment, to earnings, if it applies to manager of corporation who is making $50,000 a year and also the same degree a worker who gets say $5000 a year?"
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3343.244,3347.98,I don't think it's necessary to equate it to earnings Mr. Chief Justice.
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3374.596,3396.164,(Inaudible) that mode of repayment of a physical injury is a function of wage (Inaudible).
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3396.164,3400.42,"I believe it is a function of wages, but I believe that the legislature has the right --"
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3400.42,3403.336,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3403.336,3409.956,The legislature has the right to say in which way this will be computed and how much they shall be.
1957.303,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3409.956,3414.193,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3414.193,3444.435,"A comment has already been made on the effect if this should go back to the board, and I would like to point attention to page 49 of the record, which is the petitioner's application for adjustment of claim, which incidentally is dated 3 years after the period of limitation."
1957.303,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3497.816,3504.095,"Well, that's involved in an assumption to accept that (Inaudible)"
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3504.095,3504.502,I don't --
1957.303,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3504.502,3517.074,(Inaudible) that an educated man capable of being manager or official ever going earn any more money because he got one leg and arm cut off.
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3528.828,3532.082,"Mr. Justice Black, I think it's all through the act."
1957.303,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3571.73,3578.069,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3578.069,3579.656,"Yes, we do Justice Whittaker."
1957.303,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3579.656,3587.698,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3587.698,3612.035,"Yes, whenever there is a permanent injury of any nature, the person against, that is the carrier pays in addition to the injured workman a 2% of the award, and that goes in to the second injury fund and is used for those cases where before this accident, there is a pre-existing condition and --"
1957.303,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3612.035,3618.858,(Inaudible)
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3618.858,3623.109,Right.
1957.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3631.177,3634.661,Which page?
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3634.661,3635.327,52 --
1957.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3635.327,3636.647,Thank you.

1957.303,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3666.189,3676.507,(Inaudible) it says and continues -- no end medical result having been reached.
1957.303,3,23875,frederick_o_eastaugh,,3676.507,3677.5,Right.
