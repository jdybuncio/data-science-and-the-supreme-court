1982.81-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.347,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 81-185, Simopoulos against Virginia."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,12.008,24.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal from the Supreme Court of Virginia dates back three years and one day ago, when a team of Falls Church police arrived at the American Women's Clinic in that city."
1982.81-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,70.558,74.599,Why are these factors relevant to the basic issue presented?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,74.599,76.652,"--These are basic background facts, Your Honor."
1982.81-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,79.163,81.345,I fail to see what they have to do with the case.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,81.345,90.621,"They are just background about the fact that he was then arrested, he was then charged under the particular Virginia statute, the Virginia Code 18.2-71."
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,261.382,262.244,Mr. Lucas--
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,262.244,263.063,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,263.063,270.868,"--it would help me if you would describe the type of clinic, tell me whether it is licensed under Virginia law as an out-patient hospital."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,270.868,275.18,"Your Honor, the clinic does not have a license as an out-patient hospital."
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,290.57,293.563,Was the clinic licensed under the laws of Virginia?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,293.563,295.814,--It was not licensed under the laws of Virginia.
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,304.309,306.612,"Well, that was after all these events had occurred, though, was it not?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,306.612,308.122,That's correct.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,308.122,311.214,But he never applied before?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,311.214,311.815,He never applied.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,317.528,321.342,"Well, yes, again but this was after the events that led to his indictment."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,321.342,321.8,--That's correct.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,323.423,331.838,"But getting to my brother Powell's question to you, could he have applied for certification as an out-patient surgical hospital?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,331.838,338.803,I would think that the interpretation the Attorney General offered in denying him later would have applied earlier.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.183,341.234,That wasn't my question.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,342.855,344.737,--He could have theoretically--
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,344.737,345.338,To whom?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,345.338,350.109,"--He could have applied to the State Department of Health, the same people that license hospitals in general."
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,353.392,359.997,Has anyone tried to get certification as an out-patient surgical hospital?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,359.997,366.92,As first... There are some out-patient abortion hospitals in the Commonwealth that are licensed to do first trimesters.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,369.222,373.155,"Well, he did... Dr. Simopoulos also did first trimester abortions, did he not?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,373.155,373.986,--That's correct.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,373.986,375.946,But he never sought first certification?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,375.946,379.519,"He did not attempt to apply for that, and the state has never required him to."
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.937,401.204,"Well, what I am really getting to, are there... of the... I gather there are several clinics rather than hospitals, abortion clinics, are there not, in Virginia?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,401.204,404.056,"--The record is quite silent on that, but I am certain there are."
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,404.056,405.135,All right.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,410.658,417.804,There is no evidence that a facility performing second trimester abortions could even obtain certification.
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,449.584,455.058,The out-patient surgical hospitals are described as hospitals under the Virginia regulations.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,455.058,462.514,"They are indeed, but they are prescribed as hospitals that are for day type surgery, where the patients do not stay overnight, and--"
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,462.514,474.611,But only for... second trimester abortions are different from the first trimester abortions that can be performed in a different type surgical hospital.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,474.611,476.922,--I don't believe I understood your question.
1982.81-185,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,477.724,494.554,"Well, there is a category under the Virginia regulations of out-patient surgical hospitals, and I assumed that they were the places that under Virginia law second trimester abortions normally would be performed."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,494.554,500.308,--There is absolutely nothing in the record or any of the health department reports or anything to support that.
1982.81-185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.469,582.051,"May I ask you, Mr. Lucas, one other question on the Virginia regulations, just to be sure I understand it correctly?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,593.817,594.739,--That is correct.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.12,807.789,Do you get any guidance from the cases in this Court about the constitutionality of requiring second trimester abortions to be performed in a hospital?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,807.789,812.844,There have been mentions from time to time in the Court's opinion from Roe and onward.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.787,836.97,"And one of them was what, a hospital requirement?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,836.97,840.202,Roe did refer to the possibility of a hospital requirement.
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.148,1055.851,Why can your client complain about that aspect of the statute since I understand he was involved with a second trimester abortion?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1055.851,1059.113,"--Well, he is primarily complaining about the second trimester."
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.657,1078.597,"Yes, but outside the field of free speech and so forth, haven't we adopted the position in that kind of a challenge that you can challenge the parts of the statute that apply to your conduct, but not parts of the statute that apply to other people's conduct?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1078.597,1090.956,"We cited cases in our reply brief, such as Eisenstadt v. Baird, Broderick v. Oklahoma, which have applied the standing concept in a broader way when the right of privacy is concerned, and the Court has certainly--"
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.956,1094.079,You think Broderick versus Oklahoma supports your position?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1094.079,1095.778,"--On the standing question, yes."
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.778,1097.409,"On the merits, do you think it supports it?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1097.409,1100.731,"And on the merits, it is a First Amendment case, so I don't think it would be applicable."
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.699,1260.956,"If it is a statutory defense, I presume that the trial court is thought to have considered it, and that the Supreme Court of Virginia would have considered it, if it thought it was a statutory defense."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1260.956,1262.178,"--Well, the trial--"
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.178,1267.121,So aren't you basically just asking us to reweigh evidence that has been already addressed by two other courts?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1267.121,1267.902,--Not at all.
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.186,1277.936,How about the Supreme Court of Virginia?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1277.936,1285.823,"The Supreme Court of Virginia said that the burden of persuasion was on the prosecution, but that is simply not what happened at the trial."
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1285.823,1298.369,"Well, but we take the basic factual issues pretty much as we get them from lower courts, and unless you are asking us to simply reweigh facts, or reweigh the burden of proof or the weight of the evidence."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1298.369,1303.683,"In the cases such as Sandstrom, the Court has looked at the transcript to see what happened, and the Virginia Supreme Court--"
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.683,1307.846,"Well, that was an instruction to a jury in a jury... in a case tried by a jury."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1307.846,1317.723,"--Well, Jackson v. Virginia indicates that in a bench trial the same standards would apply, that you would... that the trial judge in a bench trial is presumed to instruct himself or herself."
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1317.723,1325.017,"Yes, and that is why I was asking, are you asking us to reweigh the evidence in the case under a kind of a Jackson versus Virginia theory?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1325.017,1327.04,That is certainly part of our argument.
1982.81-185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.119,1329.882,Do you cite Jackson against Virginia in your brief?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1329.882,1350.155,"--Extensively, yes, and we cited Sandstrom also, and Patterson also, and we attempted to show that in this case, that because the burden of production on that question involves a constitutional defense, that in that limited area, which would apply in this case, in that limited area, that the burden of production and persuasion should be entirely on the Commonwealth."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.536,1391.412,Suppose... suppose it was not necessary for the state to allege it in the indictment.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1391.412,1404.408,"Then the state would, under U.S. v. Vuitch, we would suggest that it is, but if the... under the interpretation that the Commonwealth... the Virginia Supreme Court offered--"
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.408,1414.296,Do you think it would be unconstitutional to require that the defendant in such case plead medical necessity?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1414.296,1419.509,"--I think that would be a close question, since it is constitutionally protected conduct."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.509,1422.331,What did the Virginia Supreme Court hold in this case?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1422.331,1426.935,They squarely held that it was not unconstitutional to require him to invoke the question.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.884,1430.288,"And they also held that he didn't, didn't they?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1430.288,1431.908,"--No, they didn't."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.324,1449.078,"No, but does he just have to say, I invoke the defense?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1452.972,1458.726,There is no procedure under the Virginia criminal procedure for invoking a particular defense of this nature.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.396,1484.23,"You don't think that in order to invoke the defense, there has to be testimony at the trial supporting the defense at all?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1484.23,1487.813,That would occur in the case of the defendant's case.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.68,1500.793,On its side of the case.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1500.793,1502.544,Pardon me?
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.544,1503.946,On its side of the case.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1503.946,1504.444,Yes.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.599,1519.333,Before... How does the state know what defense the defendant is going to offer?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1519.333,1525.628,"The arguments based on U.S. v. Vuitch, I think, clearly alerted the Commonwealth to the medical necessity question."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.151,1533.545,Do you think that is all the raising that has to go on?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1533.545,1534.995,"--I would think so, yes."
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1541.62,1544.322,"May I be clear about this, Mr. Lucas?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1554.089,1557.051,I believe we have taken that position throughout.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1557.051,1557.472,You have?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1558.453,1559.122,"Oh, yes, I am."
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1559.122,1560.474,"Well, I don't understand."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1573.453,1573.933,The latter.
1982.81-185,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1573.933,1574.501,The latter?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1574.501,1575.533,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.533,1578.335,Suppose you are wrong on that.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1578.335,1584.089,Then there are other approaches to it.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.069,1608.645,Do you think the Virginia Supreme Court approached... construed the statute to indicate that the absence of medical necessity was an element of the crime?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1608.645,1610.135,"--No, they did not."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.672,1630.439,"Well, aren't we... must we not accept that construction of the Virginia statute, and then the question is, is it constitutional as so construed?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1630.439,1642.787,"Yes, accepting that construction of the Virginia statute then takes you immediately into the Roe v. Wade question of whether they can indict people for every abortion in the Commonwealth, and that is the central thrust of our first argument."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.787,1655.165,"I know, but suppose, though, it is recognized that medical necessity is a defense, it is not an element of the crime, but it is a defense, which... the Virginia Supreme Court seemed to recognize it as a defense."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1655.165,1656.856,"They treated it as a defense, yes."
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.856,1657.456,Yes.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1659.908,1661.049,I would think not.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.049,1662.399,"Well, you say it is not."
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1662.399,1663.2,We have argued strenuously that it is not.
1982.81-185,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.2,1663.751,I know.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1676.841,1678.962,"That is certainly where we are, yes."
1982.81-185,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.962,1689.217,"Mr. Lucas, self-defense to a murder, is the government obliged to reach that in its case?"
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1689.217,1693.089,"Well, this Court I don't believe has decided that, but addressed it in the--"
1982.81-185,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.089,1695.771,Do you know of any other case like that?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1695.771,1697.892,"--Not in this Court, sir."
1982.81-185,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.005,1712.103,And you have that the government in the self-defense case has to put on evidence to rebut the self-defense point in the case in chief.
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1712.103,1716.535,"Representing a defendant, I would argue that the government does have that obligation."
1982.81-185,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.535,1719.317,Do you have anything to back you up other than you?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1719.317,1725.912,"Only the decisions at a lower level than this Court, and the discussion that that is at least a substantial--"
1982.81-185,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1725.912,1727.792,Any in Virginia?
1982.81-185,0,39756,roy_lucas,,1727.792,1730.586,"--In Virginia, Virginia goes the other way."
1982.81-185,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1736.467,1738.22,Very well.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1742.304,1756.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Virginia respectfully submits that this Court may, and indeed that this Court should affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia based upon the law and the facts of this case."
1982.81-185,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.304,1870.025,Mr. Broaddus--
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1870.025,1870.806,"--Yes, ma'am."
1982.81-185,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.806,1875.278,--could the clinic have been licensed as a hospital?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1875.278,1881.883,We factually do not know whether Dr. Simopoulos's clinic could have been so licensed.
1982.81-185,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.883,1884.176,Have other clinics been licensed--
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1884.176,1885.176,"Yes, ma'am, they certainly have."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1895.861,1899.795,"--Can you briefly state, Mr. Broaddus, what the procedure is for doing that?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1899.795,1905.478,"--Mr. Justice Brennan, that is set forth in the Commonwealth's addendum."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1941.893,1950.429,"And if Dr. Simopoulos had done all those things, he might have made an application to what agency?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1950.429,1952.139,"To the State Board of Health, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1952.139,1956.011,And it might have granted him such a certificate?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1956.011,1956.582,"Certainly, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1956.582,1957.413,For this very clinic?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1957.413,1958.293,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.293,1959.715,And for second trimester?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1959.715,1960.954,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.805,2022.637,"Mr. Broaddus, may I interrupt--"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2022.637,2023.355,--Certainly.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.355,2025.408,--just to be sure you completed your answer to Justice O'Connor?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2034.843,2035.644,"That's correct, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.644,2042.109,And are they licensed... and you say... those four facilities are licensed to perform second trimester abortions?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2042.109,2050.203,The Part 2 does not limit the type of surgical procedure which could be provided within that facility.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.164,2056.947,May they lawfully perform second trimester abortions?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2056.947,2057.997,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.286,2071.007,I see.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2071.007,2072.038,"Now, they are also--"
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2072.038,2073.969,But without limitation as to trimester?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2077.902,2078.353,"--That is correct, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2078.921,2080.403,You are making that representation?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2080.403,2081.925,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2081.925,2101.227,"Mr. Attorney General, when you said that one of the requirements was that these second trimester abortions be performed in hospitals, I take it from what you have subsequently said that you are talking about the out-patient surgical type hospitals described in Part 2 of the regulations?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2101.227,2104.94,The Virginia abortion statute does not define hospital.
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2126.945,2128.936,But as long as it... it has to be licensed.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2129.546,2133.718,"Yes, sir, licensed by the Commonwealth, meeting those regulations prescribed by the Commonwealth."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.718,2144.957,"--It would seem to me that if you read the statute literally, it even would not have been violated if he had had a license under Part 3 of the regulations, because it is still a hospital, but it is not presented by this case."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2144.957,2155.493,"Except, sir, that in Part 3 of the regulations, by virtue of the regulations themselves, the surgical procedure there is limited--"
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.493,2156.624,It might have violated those regulations.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2156.624,2157.265,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.265,2158.886,But I am not sure he would have violated the statute under which--
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2158.886,2160.616,"Quite possibly you are correct, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2160.616,2172.384,"--Mr. Broaddus, have the Virginia courts interpreted the licensing statute in other cases, to your knowledge?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2172.384,2179.55,"I am not aware of any decisions which do that, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2217.734,2220.706,You make that as a flat statement now.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2222.596,2240.848,"Based upon the Table 2 in Dr. Simopoulos's addendum and Table 20 in our addendum, I believe that an analysis of all of the abortions and natural childbirths over the same span of years would yield that result, that it is at least equal to, if not greater than."
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2240.848,2246.803,"Well, as I read the briefs, there certainly is disagreement on that proposition."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2246.803,2261.413,"When one includes all abortions performed in the first trimester, then certainly the mortality rate will be lower, because that is 90 percent of all the abortions, and the mortality rate there is only one."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.783,2280.355,When was this statute passed?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2280.355,2282.596,"In 1975, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.596,2284.878,"And has it been amended since, or not?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2284.878,2285.789,"No, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.789,2291.092,And had it been proposed before?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2291.092,2302.268,"It was... the revision which is present law was proposed in 1974, when the General Assembly convened following this Court's decision in Roe v. Wade."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.021,2311.156,Does Virginia have any sort of legislative history behind statutes?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2314.746,2319.829,"In this particular situation, no, sir, and as a general proposition there is no legislative history."
1982.81-185,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2325.686,2332.138,"Were the regulations adopted in June, 1977, in effect at all times relevant to this case?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2332.138,2333.26,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.607,2345.488,Who issues the regulations?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2345.488,2346.957,"The State Board of Health, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.957,2352.083,Is there an administrative law procedure in Virginia for--
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2352.083,2355.203,"Yes, sir, it requires public hearings, advertisement."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.706,2361.217,--Were these regulations adopted after such a procedure?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2363.989,2365.961,I can only assume that they--
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.961,2367.113,Is there a record kept of that?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2367.113,2369.674,--Of the proceeding itself?
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.674,2370.233,Yes.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2370.233,2373.656,I don't know in this particular case whether there was a record kept or not.
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.656,2375.348,There is a notice.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2377.429,2378.659,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.562,2393.069,"Well, do you know whether the proceeding generated any interest in the community and that there were responses?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2396.499,2397.701,With respect to the adoption of the--
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.701,2398.442,Of the regulations.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2398.442,2399.301,--of the regulations?
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.999,2411.48,"The regulations recite there was a public hearing on January 26th, 1977."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2411.48,2412.311,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.474,2418.906,But you don't know whether there was a record of it?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2418.906,2420.286,"--No, sir, I do not."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.286,2424.069,Or what the factual basis for the regulation was?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2424.069,2442.571,"Well, the basis would be in the code of Virginia, which provides that hospitals may be or would include out-patient hospitals under regulations authorized and promulgated by the State Board of Health, meeting certain specified requirements in the code."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.131,2451.988,"Well, did the statute require that hospitals be licensed?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2451.988,2454.88,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.88,2464.825,Did it require that every second trimester abortion be performed in a licensed hospital?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2464.825,2466.578,The criminal code of Virginia does.
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2507.294,2529.276,"When you say hospital, when you said hospital in response to that last question, that includes any clinic like the petitioner's, the appellant's clinic here if he had secured a license as an out-patient hospital."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2529.276,2529.897,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2530.909,2539.334,So it doesn't mean... the statute does not... is not limited to a hospital in the traditional sense that we think of hospitals.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2539.334,2540.446,"That is exactly right, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.216,2543.868,Perhaps I should ask my question another way.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2569.584,2571.604,Not without a license.
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.604,2578.24,So it had no authority whatsoever to exempt him from the licensing requirement.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2578.24,2579.351,"That's correct, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2624.96,2628.002,Are those standards in evidence in this appendix?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2628.002,2646.835,"They are referred to, Mr. Chief Justice, in the amicus brief filed by the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the other two cases which the Court will hear this afternoon, and I believe the reference specifically would be on Page 23 and 24 of that brief."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.436,2707.517,"Mr. Broaddus, may I ask you a question?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2707.517,2708.026,"--Certainly, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.026,2710.877,Your fine tuning comment made me think of this.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2722.714,2723.435,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.435,2732.712,"Now, something in the record, I can't remember what it is, indicated there were some 6,000 second trimester abortions performed in Virginia."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2743.238,2767.224,"I believe, sir, that the information in the addendum suggests that there are approximately 3,000 abortions performed in the second trimester, and that they were performed, or at least there is other information in the addendum that suggests that... I am getting somewhat confused on my facts."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.658,2774.319,During what period of time?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2774.319,2775.681,--In the second trimester.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.681,2777.462,"But during what... during a year, or during--"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2787.788,2804.68,There are requirements that the clinics and the hospitals be inspected annually to ensure that they continue to maintain the standards that they are required to keep.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.888,2832.557,"But if in fact a significant number of them were not being performed in appropriate facilities by reason of the statute, then the question, I think, would arise as to whether the statute is in the best health interests of the people involved."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2832.557,2844.444,"Well, I would respectfully suggest, sir, that there is no information in the record of this case that suggests that they are not uniformly performed in the second trimester."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.444,2855.712,And I take it there is no legislative history indicating what kind of an inquiry the legislature made as to the possible impact of this statute on where these operations might be performed.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2855.712,2862.567,There is no written legislative history that we could bring before this Court that would indicate the nature of the inquiry.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.984,2880.289,"As far as public records goes, is this the only prosecution involving a second trimester abortion of which we have any official knowledge?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2880.289,2883.562,"--I am not aware of any other prosecution, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.562,2891.124,"You referred to investigations or inspections, periodic inspections by the State Health Department of hospitals."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2893.806,2894.547,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.547,2904.434,"Now, does the State Department of Health inspect in any way establishments of the kind that this appellant was operating?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2904.434,2909.437,Not unless he is possessing a license.
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.069,2917.214,"On the facts of this case, has he been subject to any periodic examination?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2917.214,2921.035,There would be no obligation for the State Department of Health to make such an investigation.
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.035,2923.026,He would be just like any other doctor's office.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2923.026,2924.057,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.057,2932.842,"General, you talked about there was no written evidence of the state's reason for this statute."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2941.648,2944.78,None in the record of the trial.
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.176,2967.604,"Well, did the defendant put in any evidence going to the justification for the hospital requirement?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2969.517,2981.703,"--The defendant put on experts who testified that in their opinion, his particular facility was sufficiently well equipped, that it was safe to administer the procedure within that facility."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.703,2990.749,They didn't... He didn't challenge the requirement of having some facility that measures up to standards?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,2990.749,2991.53,"That's correct, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.186,3006.56,He could have had a license if he... He should have been able to get a license if he applied for one?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3006.56,3007.822,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3007.822,3017.567,"Well, I gather, Mr. Broaddus, it is no violation, criminal or otherwise, is it, or was it, for him to operate without a license?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3017.567,3018.278,"No, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.572,3023.791,I see.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3032.257,3038.481,I don't know of any other criminal law requirements for hospitalization requirements.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.685,3053.22,"Apart from the criminal law, is there any Virginia statute that restricts the kind of operation he might perform in that facility other than second trimester abortions?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3053.22,3054.953,I'm not aware of any.
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.953,3055.972,Brain surgery or anything like that?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3055.972,3056.563,"No, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.563,3058.085,He could do that at home.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3064.357,3077.927,"Well, I would respectfully suggest, sir, that surgeons are not likely to perform appendectomies or other types of operations in their offices."
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3077.927,3080.599,"Except in an emergency, conceivably."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3080.599,3082.339,"Conceivably, yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3082.339,3091.435,"If a patient came to the office, and it was obvious that there was a ruptured appendix, conceivably he might be justified in doing it right there."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3091.435,3091.975,Certainly.
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.626,3096.56,"Well, there are laws against malpractice, I suppose."
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3102.494,3104.114,"I apologize, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3106.405,3112.319,What I am trying to say is that there are all kinds of surgical procedures--
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3112.319,3113.04,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3113.04,3126.328,"--minor and major, and would it be violative of Virginia law in any respect if a physician lanced a carbuncle on the back of a patient's neck in the office?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3126.328,3127.76,"No, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3127.76,3130.441,And that is a surgical procedure.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3130.441,3132.251,"Yes, sir, I would agree."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.574,3167.437,What is involved in the assertion?
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3167.437,3184.287,"That could be brought about either through the cross examination of witnesses for the prosecution, by the introduction of witnesses on his own behalf, or through any other means which brings it to the attention of the court and the prosecution."
1982.81-185,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.287,3192.622,But it isn't necessarily fatal to the state's case on its side of the case if it puts on no evidence of necessity.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3192.622,3194.262,"That's correct, sir."
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.991,3331.753,"Mr. Broaddus, may I ask you another question about history?"
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3355.588,3357.1,"Prior to '77, sir?"
1982.81-185,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.1,3358.03,Yes.
1982.81-185,1,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3362.624,3376.212,"I think prior to '77, sir, it would have been possible to perform it legally only within a conventional general acute care hospital, because the state prior to that time did not have the licensing requirements for out-patient hospitals."
1982.81-185,2,39756,roy_lucas,,3624.765,3641.475,"If I may further reply to Justice Blackmun's question concerning whether she was told to return or not, under the Virginia Supreme Court interpretation of the statute, that might not make any difference, but on Page 187 of the Joint Appendix, she squarely admits that the doctor told her to go to the hospital if she had severe cramps."
1982.81-185,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.341,3727.902,"Thank you, gentlemen."
