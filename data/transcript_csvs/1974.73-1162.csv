1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.663,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Wilson and Bryan.
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,34.51,37.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1162,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,765.432,769.399,"Mr. Norton, was there any formal objection to use of a summary procedure?"
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,769.399,772.566,"There was not, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1281.153,1284.205,Were they then incarcerated or --
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1284.205,1307.923,"Well, they were and that's my next observation that first, in any trial, there's not likely to be a long period of potential coercive confinement, but in this case, in addition, they were both incarcerated already so that any additional incarceration pursuant or of confinement of civil contempt would have been superfluous, which Judge --"
1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1307.923,1311.73,There was then just a confinement in a different place.
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1311.73,1312.621,That's true.
1974.73-1162,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.902,1560.642,"Mr. Norton, don't you think the Court that decided Harris would probably decide this case against you?"
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1560.642,1562.036,I would not think so.
1974.73-1162,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1574.675,1580.556,"On the other hand, the Court that decided Brown, a fortiori would decide this case in your favor?"
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1580.556,1583.143,No question.
1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.143,1595.34,"Well, the difference in Harris was that you don't have 12 jurors and witnesses and the whole mechanism of a Court standing by waiting."
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1595.703,1596.975,"Well, that's one, that's --"
1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.975,1600.83,-- a grand jury could take the matter up to 30 days or 60 days later.
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1600.83,1601.544,That's right.
1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1601.544,1607.435,But a petite jury would be difficult to hold -- petite jury trial would be difficult to hold in time.
1974.73-1162,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1607.435,1610.98,"That's right, and most trials it'd only take a few days."
1974.73-1162,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.629,1658.284,Very well.
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1670.577,1673.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.054,1739.829,"Well, on the question of it's being respectful or disrespectful or otherwise, what difference does that make in terms of holding up a trial of a jury case where you have 12 or possibly 14 jurors with alternates standing by and witnesses standing by, approaching the end?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1739.829,1750.159,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the distinction is that the purpose of summary power is not just to move the trial along, but to preserve the authority and the dignity of the Court."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.159,1752.417,And how do you distinguish the two?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1756.831,1779.38,"Well, there may be some link but, I might add, that that precipitous summary action may well do more to infringe upon the authority and dignity of the Court than the short adjournment of perhaps 24 hours so that a hearing can be held to allow the accused, condemned, or an opportunity to defend."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.047,1878.958,"What kind of liability are you referring to, I'm not quite clear?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1878.958,1888.341,"Well, on cross-examination, for example, if defense counsel were to ask Mr. Wilson to impeach his credibility about the commission of other crimes."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.341,1891.767,"Well, how would that injure him?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1897.605,1917.798,"Well, that is so, but whether or not they were known to the probation department is -- without Mr. Wilson's testimony is another -- now, the question that I have to hasten to add that I don't suggest that there were those other crimes committed here, but there is that possibility."
1974.73-1162,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1917.798,1929.775,"Mrs. Ginsberg, I asked government counsel as to whether there was an objection made to the summary procedure here, was there -- do you feel there was sufficient objection made?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1929.775,1930.366,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1162,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1957.523,1961.238,"Let me ask you another question, now that I have you interrupted."
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,1972.143,1993.857,"Well, Your Honor, I argue of course that that -- there is a due process right to a hearing and I would also rely on the supervisory powers of the Court to preclude from the ambit of Rule 42 (a), an orderly respectful refusal to testify."
1974.73-1162,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1993.857,1995.333,"Now, this is a federal case --"
1974.73-1162,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1995.414,2001.979,-- and the next one might be a state case and our supervisory power might not exist in a state case.
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2008.501,2011.028,"Well, as I said, I've --"
1974.73-1162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.028,2018.442,Don't you think Harris is just a construction of a rule?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2018.442,2018.752,Well --
1974.73-1162,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.752,2019.976,"That's all you need, isn't it?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2019.976,2021.045,"Yes, that's all that I need."
1974.73-1162,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2022.444,2027.088,But it isn't at all what the next case needs coming up from a state's side?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2027.088,2028.172,"No, that's true."
1974.73-1162,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2029.741,2035.16,I'm just looking ahead to our further agony.[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2035.16,2047.763,"In any case, Judge Lasker, recognizing the viability of the respondent's claims, attempted to sentence him before requiring his testimony."
1974.73-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.768,2193.366,"Ms. Ginsberg, did this contempt require mens rea?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2193.366,2195.143,"I believe it does, Your Honor."
1974.73-1162,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.143,2201.471,Do you have authority for that proposition?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2201.471,2207.122,I believe there is a per curium on decision of this Court.
1974.73-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.126,2230.702,"Well, there is a per curium involving a contempt in a federal court and maybe the case you're thinking about, long polysyllabic name, in which the -- there was a lot of very gross conspicuous misconduct by one of the defendants in the case."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2268.898,2273.885,Aren't these all matters that the Court could take into account at a subsequent point?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2273.885,2274.755,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.613,2285.339,"Aren't you aware that a vast majority of contempt citations, penalties are reduced after their original imposition?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2285.339,2297.051,"Well, that may well be, Your Honor, but I think that, as a general principle of law and as it applies in this case, a Rule 35 motion is insufficient to compensate for the deficiencies of this procedure."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2323.654,2337.455,"Well, I could understand your position about his possible mental condition if he had engaged in disruptive conduct as in the case that Mr. Justice Stewart referred to."
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2347.111,2347.345,Oh!
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2350.765,2352.198,No misconduct of any kind.
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2352.198,2352.722,None.
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2353.642,2357.601,Except the refusal in itself.
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2357.601,2367.975,"But, clearly, there are levels of or brands of incompetence which go the witness' inability to comprehend the obligation to testify."
1974.73-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.582,2454.579,Could that procedure -- is that a statutory procedure or one worked out on the Second Circuit?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2454.579,2457.685,"I believe it was worked out in the Second Circuit, but not just on this appeal."
1974.73-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.161,2499.645,"And that protection is not against self-incrimination, but against reprisals in the penitentiary and so on, isn't it?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2499.645,2500.188,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2502.312,2505.743,"Well, I'm talking about the protection procedure that's been worked out?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2505.743,2506.401,"Well, no."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2519.906,2522.094,To be sure you're going to get a neutral judgment in the sentencing --
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2522.094,2522.769,Exactly.
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2522.769,2524.425,-- isn't that your -- the theory of it?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2524.425,2525.346,Exactly so.
1974.73-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.346,2529.745,"And the sealed testimony also serves the same function, does it?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2529.745,2530.114,Yes.
1974.73-1162,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2530.114,2531.276,The sealing of the testimony?
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2531.276,2532.203,Exactly.
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2585.66,2591.466,"Well, he was punishing him for his contumacious refusal to answer, wasn't he?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2591.466,2597.213,"That's correct, but it was not intended to coerce the testimony, this punishment."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2608.785,2618.028,"Well, isn't part of it the deterrence of that kind of conduct with respect to other witnesses in other cases?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2618.028,2628.381,"Well, if in fact that is one of the purposes, it doesn't seem as though that purpose would be thwarted by notice of 24 hours and a short hearing."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2645.232,2649.243,"There, your taking issue with Rule 42 (a), are you?"
1974.73-1162,1,41372,sheila_ginsberg,,2649.243,2650.707,"No, sir."
1974.73-1162,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2662.044,2668.988,Thank you.
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2671.338,2673.86,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2893.242,2902.09,"Well, one of the consequences of this conduct was quite serious, was it not, in terms of the results of one of the trials?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2902.09,2927.448,"It certainly was, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm suggesting is not that the punishment was not proper and, indeed, I think an argument could be made by the Government at some future time that in a situation like this, it might be appropriate to impanel a jury so that a more severe sentence could be imposed, but that has to do with the punishment fitting the crime."
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2969.448,2974.533,"More likely, the alternative is that we would have had your case submitted on briefs."
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2974.533,2977.436,"Also a possibility, obviously, Your Honor."
1974.73-1162,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2987.08,2992.01,"How much notice would've been sufficient do you think in this case, 24 hours?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2992.01,2997.18,"I would think that, certainly a 24-hour period might have been reasonable."
1974.73-1162,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3125.889,3143.44,"The difficulty is Mr. Martin for me at least, one difficulty, that we're dealing here really with the specific language of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, are we not, unless, you're suggesting that there's something constitutionally deficient about the language of 42 (a)?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3143.44,3144.138,I am.
1974.73-1162,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3156.347,3156.844,I see.
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3157.039,3157.534,What I'm suggesting is merely --
1974.73-1162,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3157.534,3165.241,Does this mean that you do concede that the language of 42 (a) would permit summary contempt power in these circumstances of this case?
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3165.241,3167.869,"I do, and this is really what I was addressing myself to at the outset."
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3184.515,3186.331,"Well, the judge was well-aware, was he not?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3192.406,3193.422,I think that that is true.
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3229.619,3244.576,"Well, your submission requires you, I take it, to either say that 42 (a) is constitutionally flawed or else this is not a 42 (a) case?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3244.576,3253.57,"Well, I think it requires the Court to say that 42 (a) is constitutionally flawed in the circumstances of this case."
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3294.816,3295.214,"Well, I go back to the --"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3295.214,3296.104,People like --
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3296.104,3299.043,I go back to the consequences on the other trial.
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3304.873,3308.506,I think it is true that it disrupts the trial.
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3315.34,3324.409,I'm speaking also of the suggestion of the Solicitor General that there was a serious miscarriage of justice by the directed acquittal.
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3325.413,3326.156,That's right.
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3365.938,3374.638,"What was the sentence imposed on the one defendant who was found guilty in the -- was it a new trial, separate?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3374.638,3375.452,In the Anderson?
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3375.452,3375.718,Yeah.
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3375.718,3378.911,"Ultimate sentence, I must say, I just don't know, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.911,3380.246,To the bank robbery so it can be assumed --
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3380.246,3380.434,Oh!
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3380.493,3382.555,It can be assumed that it's a very substantial sentence.
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3382.555,3385.385,My client was sentenced to 10 years for the bank robbery.
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.323,3411.617,"For conduct that leads to the acquittal of a man guilty, apparently, of a 10-year offense?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3411.617,3411.91,"No, sir."
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3438.426,3448.931,"Your alternative argument was that it should -- they should give him, or perhaps it was your colleague's argument, give him time to think it over until the next day and he might change his mind."
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3448.931,3449.896,"Well, I think that that --"
1974.73-1162,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3449.896,3460.984,"But, does that mean that every time a court is confronted with a recalcitrant witness you stop all the proceedings and give him 24 hours to think it over and see if he's going to answer questions?"
1974.73-1162,2,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3460.984,3464.823,"Well, I think in most instances, that probably is not going to be necessary."
