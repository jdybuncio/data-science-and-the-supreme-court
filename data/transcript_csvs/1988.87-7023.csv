1988.87-7023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.45,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-7023, Tyrone Hardin v. Dennis Straub."
1988.87-7023,0,21243,douglas_ryan_mullkoff,,14.573,18.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-7023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.493,328.539,You're not really talking about deterring 1983 claims.
1988.87-7023,0,21243,douglas_ryan_mullkoff,,329.648,329.976,I'm sorry.
1988.87-7023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.976,333.351,"--deterring the conduct on which 1983 claims are based, aren't you?"
1988.87-7023,0,21243,douglas_ryan_mullkoff,,333.351,334.443,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-7023,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,460.548,465.36,That's... that's settled by decision.
1988.87-7023,0,21243,douglas_ryan_mullkoff,,465.36,483.476,"That... that appears to be settled by the case of Hawkins v. Justin that the Michigan Court of Appeals decided, and it was also acknowledged in Higley v. Michigan Department of Corrections, the Sixth Circuit case that Respondents rely on."
1988.87-7023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.382,508.451,"When... Mr. Mullkoff, when the legislature revisited the tolling statute, was there any discussion or anything in the reports, if there are reports in Michigan, that dealt with... there's a seeming incongruity where the person is in solitary confinement and claims to be wrongfully there, and he presumably isn't there by the time he brings his action."
1988.87-7023,0,21243,douglas_ryan_mullkoff,,511.904,526.865,--The legislative committee report in the 19... to the 1972 amendment to Michigan's tolling statute indicated a recognition that prisoners in modern times have increased access to courts.
1988.87-7023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,605.85,607.817,"Thank you, Mr. Mullkoff."
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,609.129,616.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.552,764.675,"Mr. Caruso, may I ask you a question?"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,764.675,764.941,--Yes.
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.941,772.61,"Do you think this same rationale would support a federal court's holding if a state statute of limitations ran with, say, a 15-year statute?"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,783.262,785.683,The court would have to make that judgment.
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.69,813.547,"So, you'd say the court could under your theory... could in effect shorten... if the state had said 15 years, say, well, for federal purposes that's too long."
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,814.515,823.214,"--That could be determined by the court as being too long, and if that's the case, they would... pursuant to 1988 and the Tomanio analysis, it should not be applied."
1988.87-7023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.214,836.35,"One thinks of the statute of limitations analysis though as, you know, a long statute benefits the plaintiff and a short statute benefits the defendant generally."
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,846.768,849.938,It had within its own power to change that.
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.405,894.17,"But, Mr. Caruso, what you describe as a federal interest in repose--"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,894.17,894.435,Yes.
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.435,897.746,"--as the Chief Justice indicated, also could be described as a state interest in repose."
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,905.962,906.571,"Yes, [inaudible]."
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.571,916.349,It's kind of hard to find an overwhelming federal interest when they keep letting us decide all these questions that they could solve for all of us in 10 minutes by just adopting a federal statute of limitations.
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,916.349,917.818,"That's, indeed, unfortunate."
1988.87-7023,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.818,918.785,And their failure to do so is a little hard to understand.
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,918.785,933.81,"But as I suggest that while the stale claim have... has... the question is not whether a stale claim has any deterrent effect or whether a deterrent effect of the state claim outweighs the federal interest in repose, as I suggest."
1988.87-7023,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1138.415,1139.929,"Of course, the fading witnesses--"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1139.929,1140.383,"xxx take an example, for--"
1988.87-7023,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1140.383,1145.224,"--Of course, witnesses' memories applies to the other side, as well as to the state."
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1145.224,1146.677,"--To both sides, that's right."
1988.87-7023,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.595,1199.999,"Mr. Caruso, surely there are some policies in both directions."
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1234.251,1236.173,"Well, the claim may not be brought... the claim may not be brought at all."
1988.87-7023,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.671,1244.794,"Well, do you want to have to sue somebody who's... who's the... the guard on your corridor?"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1248.278,1250.073,"Well, I think--"
1988.87-7023,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.073,1252.852,Wouldn't you rather have the option to wait until you get out and then sue him?
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1252.852,1253.883,--I don't think it's essential.
1988.87-7023,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.082,1266.035,"Well, it's at least an argument, isn't it?"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1266.785,1268.753,Pardon?
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.753,1273.313,--Mr. Caruso--
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1273.313,1273.563,Yes.
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.563,1275.798,--what case in this Court do you rely upon?
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1275.798,1276.983,Pardon?
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1276.983,1281.388,What case... what decision of this Court do you rely upon?
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1281.388,1285.527,I rely on the decision in Tomanio which calls--
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1285.527,1285.761,What?
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1285.761,1303.098,--in the U.S.... or the Board of Regents of NYU v. Tomanio which requires a... an analysis be made of the borrowed statute of limitation with reference to the federal laws and federal policies.
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1306.549,1307.065,Do you think--
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1307.065,1308.252,And that's what we're suggesting here.
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.252,1311.735,--Do you think the Okura case applies at all?
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1311.735,1320.652,"It applies to all cases in which the statutes of limitations of the states are borrowed, yes, all federal cases."
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.652,1322.058,Doesn't that apply to this case?
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1322.058,1323.761,It applies to this case.
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1324.73,1325.98,"And it puts you out of court, doesn't it?"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1325.98,1348.892,"--No, it does not put us out of court because I suggest that the analysis that must be made, which many of the courts did not do in the cases cited by Petitioner, and that is make the analysis to determine whether the tolling statute is inconsistent with the... the... the federal laws and the policies of the federal government."
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.214,1368.914,But you don't have any trouble with the Okura case saying that you're bound to follow the state statutes.
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1368.914,1370.351,--Well--
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.351,1373.273,"You don't have any trouble with that at all, do you?"
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1373.273,1374.709,--I'm not having trouble with that.
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1374.709,1375.053,You just ignore it.
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1375.053,1391.234,"I'm not having trouble with that, Justice Marshall, but what I am suggesting is that under 1988 in a borrowing situation such as we have here, the borrowed statute has to be viewed in light of the federal law and federal policies."
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1397.605,1399.183,The Okura case was after 1988.
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1399.823,1401.292,--Pardon?
1988.87-7023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1401.292,1408.992,The Okura case didn't have any trouble with 1988 because it was decided in 1989.
1988.87-7023,1,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1408.992,1415.771,But 1988 is the section of the Civil Rights Act I have reference to which requires the deterrence to be made.
1988.87-7023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.946,1522.649,"Thank you, Mr. Caruso."
1988.87-7023,2,21243,douglas_ryan_mullkoff,,1524.695,1526.836,Brief rebuttal.
1988.87-7023,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.131,1612.113,"Thank you, Mr. Mullkoff."
