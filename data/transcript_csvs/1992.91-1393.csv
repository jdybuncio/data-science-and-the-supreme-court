1992.91-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We'll hear argument now in Number 91-1393, A.L. Lockhart v. Bobby Ray Fretwell."
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,12.308,15.176,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.731,213.539,"General Bryant, the question you present in your petition for certiorari seems to me to assume that the Collins case was properly overruled by the Eighth Circuit on the basis of Lowenfield."
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,219.026,221.828,"That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1992.91-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.555,359.699,"Well, just to follow up on the question by the Chief Justice, is it open to the respondent to argue that the Eighth Circuit case, Collins, improperly... was improperly overruled, that it was right all the time?"
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,359.699,364.301,--It's our position that that issue is before this Court and--
1992.91-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,364.301,365.587,That it is before the Court.
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,365.587,372.074,"--The issue is before the Court, the Collins decision, simply because that was the basis for Fretwell's claim."
1992.91-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.882,418.905,"Do you think that position is entirely consistent with Teague, that you generally look at the law at the time of trial, the legal rules?"
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,418.905,433.081,It's our position that if you look at the performance prong of the Strickland test that you look at the alleged errors at the time they were made.
1992.91-1393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.003,459.299,"Would it be the same... would you give the same view if instead of being an overruling there had been a statutory change, say that an objection might have been proper at the time of trial and then by the time it gets to review and habeas corpus the legislature changes some rule and you no longer could make that objection?"
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,468.32,484.68,"Quite frankly, I have not considered that question, but I think that there would be... you could argue more forcefully for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that instance, because the legislative act would occur after the fact."
1992.91-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.68,489.901,"Well, your position is basically that the defendant shouldn't have a windfall, isn't it?"
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,489.901,491.468,That is correct.
1992.91-1393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.468,494.37,A ruling that he would not ultimately have been entitled to.
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,494.37,524.054,"And if... that is the reason why that we think the Eighth Circuit should be overruled, because the Eighth Circuit's decision really stops... when they consider the prejudice prong of the Strickland test, they stop at the time the alleged counsel's errors were made, and we think that is incorrect."
1992.91-1393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.255,646.65,Then it's just as though prior to Collins the Arkansas Supreme Court had said double counting is all right and refused to change its rule in the light of Collins.
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,646.65,647.75,"Justice White, the--"
1992.91-1393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.75,655.238,"You say that Arkansas, until it's overruled by this Court, can have its own view of the Constitution."
1992.91-1393,0,43998,winston_bryant,,655.238,657.522,--As compared to a decision by the Eighth Circuit.
1992.91-1393,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,981.365,996.089,"Before I begin, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I would like to just address the question of whether it's open to respondent to argue that Lowenfield does not apply to the Arkansas death penalty statute and that Lowenfield didn't overrule Collins."
1992.91-1393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.788,1017.804,I just want to be clear on your answer.
1992.91-1393,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1021.84,1022.123,Yes.
1992.91-1393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.123,1026.91,What should... is it open to us to say that?
1992.91-1393,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1026.91,1042.069,"Well, I think the Court in its discretion could, based on this Court's recent pronouncements on whether it should delve into the merits of a predicate that is not questioned by respondent in its opposition."
1992.91-1393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.702,1067.568,"Ms. Waxman, just refresh my recollection."
1992.91-1393,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1074.189,1076.224,"I think so, Your Honor."
1992.91-1393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.224,1079.676,Would that make a difference to you as far as waiving this argument?
1992.91-1393,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1079.676,1081.909,"Yes, he did have counsel, Your Honor."
1992.91-1393,2,40036,ricky_reed_medlock,,1594.859,1598.311,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1393,3,43998,winston_bryant,,3404.24,3414.13,"Regarding a point that has been raised, the Arkansas Supreme Court has considered the Lowenfield decision."
1992.91-1393,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3532.188,3535.057,Has the Arkansas Supreme Court ever so held--
1992.91-1393,3,43998,winston_bryant,,3535.057,3559.755,"Yes, that has been held by the Arkansas Supreme Court in a number of decisions, which is pointed out in our reply brief, and so because of that, because it's only a motive, it's not necessary that pecuniary gain be proven, so in that regard it is not a duplicate element of the initial offense."
1992.91-1393,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3580.085,3580.935,"Thank you, General Bryant."
1992.91-1393,3,43998,winston_bryant,,3582.451,3583.887,--Thank you.
