0,2011.11-262,Reichle v. Howards,11-262,1332306000.0,1338786000.0,"Virgil D. ""Gus"" Reichle, Jr., et al.",Steven Howards,8.0,0.0,1,524.0,817,6,mr chief justice may please court the issue court today whether secret service agents prepared take bullet vice president must also prepared take retaliatory arrest lawsuit even probable cause make arrest respondent case seeks personal money damages two us secret service agents arrested allegedly retaliatory motive lied whether touched vice president cheney sure the respondent case seeks personal money damages three  two us secret service agents arrested allegedly retaliatory motive lied whether touched vice president cheney there three reasons agents held personally liable first absence probable cause required element retaliatory arrest claim thus court called upon answer question left open hartman moore second us secret service agents acting protective capacity entitled qualified immunity make arrest probable cause indeed view way would subject secret service agents potential retaliatory arrest claims based upon mere allegation retaliatory animus something court steadfastly refused good reason because retaliatory animus easy allege hard disprove and third regardless whether court decides extend hartman rule law 2006 time arrest clearly established thus entitling agents qualified immunity justice ginsburg tenth circuit found probable cause underlied opinion 1001  1001 violation lying federal agent well two points justice ginsburg first devenpeck officers required give reasons behind arrest but second i think perhaps importantly case agent reichle contacted mr howards made arrest mr howards lied that relevant secret service agents assessment risk situation thats correct justice scalia i dont think yes respect arrest this  absolutely thats objective thats right justice breyer i think  determination  tenth circuit fact  tenth circuits decision extend devenpeck facts subject crossappeal so issue  posit issue court well let answer  answer questions what outlined essentially footnote 10 hartman case thats footnote says what do  person initiated prosecution says i  retaliatory reason and court sidestepped issue yes well i  certainly different devenpeck standard certainly your honor and justice  justice breyer i think difficulty  hypothetical especially regards secret service agents perform engaging protective functions theyre essentially sure okay let  let briefly address first half question i address second half the first half  justice sotomayor suggest police officers could trample first amendment important remember still probable cause  principal but probable cause fourth amendment standard specified framers constitution well im  im sure that exactly case again gets back footnote 10 hartman   hartman read two different ways it read  saying elements constitutional tort require absence probable cause read saying elements cause action but let  let address second question yes and second question secret service agents secret service agents unlike police officers providing law enforcement functions secret service acting protective capacity protecting nations leaders public way also way essentially free speech zone virtually everyone secret service agent encounters protecting president vice president allege engaged free speech so secret service agents particular  legitimately evaluate someone saying order determine particular threat level and secret service agents similar sort complexity causation   situation addressed hartman case now hartman clearly one   twoindividual causation situation   regard secret service agents causation similarly complex secret service agents legitimately take account someone saying order determine threat level regardless whether court decides extend hartman case  absolutely clear law 2006 june 2006 agents made arrest clearly established the hartman case handed early 2006 it books 3 months arrest made for reason secret service agents entitled qualified immunity case law clearly established with regard   formulation qualified immunity asking believe important secret service agents acting protective capacity requisite breathing room order make decisions lifeordeath imminentthreat situations in fact qualified immunity advocating particularly important margins particularly important situations clear secret service agent secret service agent make snap decision order determine whether someones threat act appropriately the court atwater case noted object  courts cases draw standards sufficiently clear simple applied fair prospect surviving judicial secondguessing months even years  arrests made no suggesting qualified immunity its certainly different harlow type qualified immunity it immunity contingent upon  contingent upon secret service agent  acting protective capacity probable cause make arrest but certainly immunity attaches would would full immunity claim the court noted earlier term ridner v hub case judges cautious secondguessing police officers assessment made scene danger presented particular situation we think case aptly demonstrates situation secret service agents made  difficult decisions spot secondguessed court finally regard  whether qualified immunity  clearly established june 2006 ninth circuit primary case relied upon tenth circuit skoog case the skoog case case tenth circuit relied upon holding hartman extended its important though review skoog case  read entire case skoog court concluding  hartman extended still proceeded qualified immunity analysis determine whether law clearly established time incident and skoog case concluded looked  looked nature right and know know anderson v creighton case court said important focusing constitutional rights look 30000foot level look high level look contours right and thats skoog case all right thank you,395.0,512,14,we hear argument next case 11262 reichle v howards mr gallagher there little bit noise courtroom i little bit difficulty hearing opening statement well i dont understand what probable cause what probable cause arrest explain thats false statement government officer but thats reason  1001 wasnt reason officers arrest there question assaulting vice president i think charge eventually made state court harassment so indication officers 1001 anywhere minds do give  least stop car test whether probable cause whether reason officer stopped car there broken tail light existed probably cause whether basis acted now  different respect arrest so long good reason arrest doesnt matter we never held respect claim real reason police arrested retaliation example picket sign unpopular point view statement unpopular point view that court never held overcomes arrest theres claim retaliatory first amendment action right all right and saying first reason say  question i wanted ask make strong case president vice president involved need protect rule adopt rule apply every police officer anyone arrests anyone anywhere country matter clear motive retaliation point view individual protected bivens action so sounds first claim  remedy sweeps well beyond need sketch and id like response i understand im saying i agree first probable cause arrest wouldnt i say retaliatory first amendment claim border officer chases arizona person politically disagrees 14 bishops say cared nothing political disagreement and nothing contrary says oh i happened notice trial left reached snatched five dollar bill till i probable cause arrest end case now sounds farreaching i dont know im prepared so therefore another way might win case i yes and course hartman dealt prosecutions but people time dont arrest others policemen frequently dont arrest people everything might arrest i mean jaywalking take example there kinds things normally dont arrest somebody you might  im sure didnt i might sometimes driven 60 miles hour 55mile zone and i shouldnt even admit i hope i get away laughter but   see different arrests prosecutions is different you  acknowledge prosecutors always prosecute never exercise discretion say oh heck know all time time i dont know less frequent  officer deciding arrest counsel  thats exactly justice breyer saying okay which i understand literature talks treating misdemeanor arrests different felony arrests less discretion officer would respect arresting someone felony misdemeanors criminal fines like jaywalking policemen dont arrest jaywalking unless either ticket binge theres something dont like so something dont like wearing antiwar armband going let plaintiff recover somehow need protect police officers much discretionary use vast power arrest going permit trample first amendment essentially or going say normal situation first amendment claim even probable cause prove motivating factor arrest treat secret service differently and i think point justice breyers getting one im interested if dont extend hartman principled way deal unique needs secret service if jaywalking probable cause but   violating first amendment meaning police officers discretion would otherwise arrest except dislike speech thats violation right free speech isnt we go question later you suggesting absolute immunity but different kind qualified immunity thank counsel mr srinivasan,1047.0,1622,30,thank mr chief justice may please court i think solution offered government go find problem and i think thats justice breyers question directed i done scientific search i take credit little bit science involved determining many cases arise and page 13 brief cite footnote 8 search time limitations whatsoever going back lexis words 1983  15 reported federal appellate cases time limitations whatsoever so solution really dont problem the secret service case court ever heard im aware involving anything remotely like hunter v bryant so significant problem this also factually probably best case making argument need sort special rules apply secret service given facts case mr howards accounts walked vice president looked said i want know i think policies iraq disgusting  there dispute point whether gently patted arm  crime  tapped shoulder  crime  im sorry well incidental contact assault everyone law well problem vice president mall contact numerous people shaking hands letting pat back telling great job hes and well colorado law charged harassment thats correct correct thats multifaceted question ill try best cut right well part point i make right in courts jurisprudence fourth amendment issues going agents mind irrelevant the issue right first level inquiry fourth amendment violation according tenth circuit we got shift gears going first amendment analysis and retaliatory arrest we got look subjective mind agent thats justice ginsburgs questions i think take great import discussion because correctly pointed agents scene never said deposition never claimed anywhere arrested mr howards 1001 violation the agents scene deposition said arrested way approached vice president  crime  demeanor we thought might assault that later morphed state charge harassment nobody ever said 1001 formed basis whatsoever right absolutely absolutely correct absolutely well well i think hit solution part problem expressed stop individual and answer absolutely yes they every arrow quiver terry v ohio they stop perceive threat they force open opaque bag force show whats box inside opaque bag they pat wand metal detecting wand they assure they allowed they allowed take reasonable steps terry every conceivable case courts ever decided no no what im saying it would it would if could prove terry stop retaliation free speech motivated  i know  your honors feelings intent  intent motivated constitutional torts but could prove terry stop motivated  effort punish free speech yes would cause action well well i think look  i said arrows quiver court weed kinds cases well i mean litigious plaintiffs consistent problem across board many contexts and really  almost nothing done this court taken steps cut back prison litigation frivolous things nature but yes heightened pleading standard court enunciated iqbal you cant come conclusory allegations facts support thats stopped bumper sticker well no doesnt necessarily go trial thats conclusion first well i mean evidentiary questions first supported pleading heightened scrutiny iqbal conclusions simply enough well let give flip side say police officer stop bumper stick go trial he held accountable theoretically every single person ever arrested crime could raise first amendment retaliation lawsuit every convicted murderer time throughout country could they dont however there rush courthouse retaliatory arrest claims pleading requirements heightened qualified immunity 100 years protected secret service they protecting executive branch im ready yes well lets take look facts case the tenth circuit found probable cause 1001 violation but probable cause  great body circumstantial evidence surrounding case would point probable cause considered deciding case proceeds we agent charge protective detail agent lee standing eight inches away vice president cheney entire encounter occurs agent lee testified saw crime committed we numerous agents the evidence well discreet first amendment episodes occurred context case one testified mr howards deposition first approached agent reichle agent reichle said i want talk  flashed badge mr howards declined invitation talk agent reichle that according mr howards angered agent reichle that first amendment significant event steve howards testified asked agent reichle want talk assaulting vice president response i didnt assault vice president i merely criticized policies iraq dont want criticized publicly stay undisclosed location words effect again mr howards testified angered agent reichle at point cuffs went and i think circumstantial evidence support animus  going agent reichle notice howards said vice president well lying vice president look fourth amendment analysis whats reichles actual mind devenpeck irrelevant so yes probable cause reichle directing animus mr howards arrested we look actually mind mind a 1001 violation mind we looked  mind weve  already said mind approached vice president criticized publicly absolutely well line well first constant barrage hartman applied  i mean court decided hartman 2006 retaliatory prosecutions there run courthouse retaliatory arrests either hartman this may help case i go ill say police officer absolute right listen protester saying consider said terms assessing level threat that protester poses but i said case every right stop mr howards terry stop concerned and reasonable cause concern terry standard you dont need probable cause pat someone terry its simply reasonable officer would concerned im saying immune terry patdown done retaliation free speech im simply saying would make much difficult case protester go  go court say reason patted retaliation free speech sure i agree so first order business lets see hes threat hes supposed   reasonable cause believe steve howards threat okay right then pats opens bag nothing then monitor watch  thats there probable cause believe committed crime point but didnt know that minds thats  first amendment analysis fourth amendment analysis point first amendment analysis but never minds theyve testified that didnt anything that tenth circuits post hoc rationale devenpeck  devenpeck  says  theres objective probable cause tenth circuit court court concoct post hoc even though wasnt officers mind thats good enough arrest somebody thats  probable cause all right but first amendment analysis cant objective standard you   objective standards clean nice  create bright lines but looking first amendment violation got able get subjective intent officer  scene no dont because first ive said iqbal requires heightened pleading conclusions we summary judgment standard we summary judgment standard  fact butz court held firm application rules civil procedure always prevent frivolous claims meritless litigation occurring situations exactly like and thats true a firm application rules civil procedure summary judgment standard there easy way unfortunately frequently youre talking well unfortunately easy way first amendment well i mean court decided incredibly difficulty cases snyder v phelps authored your honor difficult case could sidestepped  know somebody steps curb thereby jaywalking walking are limiting well i say  i know answer probably going like means trial involved juries daily basis throughout country every criminal case what subjective intent defendant in every civil case intentional act knowing act reckless act negligent act thats juries and enough evidence get case trial  i  i would posit case agent agent agent saw encounter close personal vice president mr howards none saw evidence criminal activity mr howards let mr howards walk away scene thats good evidence well i mean theoretically yes  could problem and  i quite certain certain civil litigants criminal cases people wrongly accused things didnt end trial sometimes juries get wrong results injustice occurs we cant fix problems really significant problem there run courtrooms around land kinds cases arising we dont need rules specifically pertain secret service knowledge court one secret service case entire history 15 appellatereported federal decisions regarding retaliatory arrests period the  way i know look westlaw lexis and  and mr srinivasan indicated found 100 400 cases we search like came number we dug cases and terms actual litigated retaliatory arrest cases found 15 total thats scientific thats best ive got point and i dont know theres repository  find but  i started argument saying solution search problem  the secret service adequately done jobs beautifully  century and  reason put different rule secret service well theyre best i mean thats  i understand but  serious serious issue curtail first amendment consider  situation actually  i believe case  secret service agents deserve taken trial gone way punish someone free speech what do guys you know would fact considered jury i could lose trial go back if get trial thats jury trials justice ginsburg and im  im saying  i show evidence court im going win trial i win case the issue simply sacrifice first amendment you know litterbug lose right first amendment free speech does jaywalker lose right first amendment free speech probable cause exists believe theyve committed offense and youll officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws jaywalking laws blocking sidewalk laws first amendment essentially evaded 100 years jurisprudence courageous jurisprudence many times court goes boards somebody litterbug i  i dont see solution problem and i also dont see secret service needs enhanced protection court never kind serious problem the status quo healthy it worked decades continue work and agents get tagged case maybe deserved get tagged case first amendment extremely important and i dont denigrate  job law enforcement  agents way im simply saying first amendment stake i think  law working fine throughout decades extend probable cause hartman onstreet encounters complex causation chain  main actor hartman immune completely lawsuit prosecutor hartman could sued circumstances could prosecutor hartman questioned deposition traditions we dont question prosecutors depositions made decisions go ahead prosecute so court stepped back hartman said thats different story but onstreet encounters  extend noprobablecause requirement onstreet encounters road police officer secret service agent wants  ostensibly enforce number legal violations  1 mile hour speed limit youre going jail allegedly going 1 mile hour speed limit or atwater wearing seat belt  real reason bumper sticker if prove go trial absent questions ill sit thank much,671.0,1063,23,thats assault isnt all takes assault  unwanted touching its incidental if reach touch somebody shoulder arm thats fine doubtless didnt consider contacts hostile but somebody tells i think policies disgusting  i mean dont tell  crime it  assault unwanted touching well youve described person arrested right he arrested later approached secret service agent lied whether touched vice president time nonprotected area carrying bag right and wandering around turns looking son but youre secret service agent see somebody said policies disgusting person touches vice president comes  lies he comes back hes carrying bag hes wondering  wandering around think reasonable  well i guess dont laughter to arrest person the reason multifaceted im trying capture might going secret service agents mind time well going reasonable secret services agents mind time they didnt say  also left one agents overheard say going ask vice president many babies killed day okay so job protect vice president thats job and emotional subject and something happens president nobodys going say oh know and whole country mourning we understand and therefore matter concern rule law says agents hear someone says many babies  killed day im going ask vice president im going touch i going tell lie ask i touched  thats cause concern okay now theres lawsuit agency say cant we cant we cant use basis stopping individual all poses problem and i  i think  i recognize problem im saying i solution and wouldnt violation first amendment they didnt like ideas expressing wouldnt violation first amendment even though theyre  racial reason would okay of course i dont see first amendment exception doesnt apply things arrest so theory person put car bumper sticker says i hate police every time pulled certainly plausible case violated first amendment rights its i going 60 miles hour bumper sticker and police officer point says know i cant give ticket guy without hauled court personal liability hes got credible case first amendment grounds no you already got officer court i mean get speeding ticket times dont show got things now hes got show district court state court defend is case could state he pulled gave speeding ticket reason picked i bumper sticker saying i hate police does go trial why doesnt go trial i mean go  depose police officer stop did stop anybody else going 65 miles per hour day its conclusion i mean  didnt bumper sticker asserted pleading stopped knows i hate police thats conclusion but bumper sticker says know i bumper sticker thats stopped so way could find put evidence heres bumper sticker put police officer stand say and sudden i dont know everybody doesnt bumper sticker but case president hearing well know combination disparate political views risk unlike situations and i dont know prove could prove contrary thats  thats claim and i cant say theres nothing so let suggest another arrow  ask think arrow answers going much im interested hearing reason in hartman justice ginsburg i dissent and referred dc circuit case and dc circuit said  talked rare cases strong motive evidence combined weak probable cause support finding prosecution would occurred animus so far think fine but suppose say factors mentioned presidents stake courts  life stake presidents  courts infer probable cause exists weak and courts infer simple presence political disagreement motive retaliation strong fact would produce limited extension hartman case protecting president united states and i know going agree im trying im saying i agree i want see react excuse lets go past second what arresting agent said showed animus  meaning another officer actually saw understood thought doesnt mean agent told touching information so i know collective knowledge theory lot cases lets deal facts case whats  whats animus how prove point animus light undisputed fact lied touching vice president and thats you understand case inviting questions chief justice asked  justice breyer us concerned adversary described first amendment voicing going part many many arrests how draw line outside one proposed adversaries probable cause line that doesnt enmesh police constant barrage claims angered police officer thats arrested would acknowledge secret service faces different situation ordinary police officers conducting daily activities secret service agents may legitimately take account first amendment activity someone vicinity president vice president assessing degree danger person presents again i  i dont understand  say immune charge first amendment retaliation immune charge first amendment  i mean say first amendment grounds one first amendment grounds why either one okay okay so putting point view i actually said he angry client i mean judging said lot swear words forth pretty angry whole situation so secret service agent hear say  speak like every right speak like i mean people i understand  hes also thinking  im nervous the  president vice president whatever thing  ive got job so   nobodys going say oh oh whatever first whatever somebody hurt and also lied whether touched president and also talking president killing people killing babies forth all right so supposed well isnt situation  situation i nothing he says okay theres lot people place well lied they didnt arrest lied right when say that means almost cases go trial front jury well  stopped go trial i engaged first amendment  i engaged first amendment activity well summary judgment thats  youre already court long time talking summary judgment well easy way we could agree laughter one thing analysis concerns seem black white view going officers mind stop  arrest retaliation legitimate security and i suspect people engaged type thing intuition i mean dont sit say well lets see says didnt like war iraq is wandering around looks like looking something  bag i mean i assume sort experience calculate say ive got something and parse different motivations one reason i fact dont like answer  agent going to factor addition hostility  views touching vice president lying wandering around bag  back mind  know im wrong i may held personally liable damages taking action jury somewhere going say based retaliation rather obligation protect vice president which  record retaliatory arrests secret service agents people say things critical president vice president well weve lost couple presidents laughter but ambivalent suppose turns trial know words spoken get trial turns reichle strong opponent war vietnam then end trial right thank counsel the case submitted,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,656.0,1184,12,thank mr chief justice may please court i would like start addressing secret service particular thats principal focus although i take point questions applying rule broader context but i think understanding rule makes sense context secret service agents law enforcement officers performing similar protective functions would help inform makes sense broaden rule well what secret service i pick point petitioners counsel making legitimate context secret service agents take account expressive activity determining whether circumstances warrant discretionary exercise power arrest yes thats correct and thats i wouldnt limit secret service particular i think happens lot contexts natural individuals encounter first amendment activity public legitimate react first amendment activity deciding whether circumstances warrant arrest and problem arises difficult distinguish one hand legitimate consideration expressive activity evidencing sort threat warrants response illegitimate consideration expressive activity borne motive suppress i think would justice kennedy would acrosstheboard noprobablecause requirement kind court applied retaliatory prosecution context hartman now i think  question degree animus asserted agent scene exactly complicated factual questions those kinds allegations made going trial agent stand jury going difficult time agent going difficult time explaining acted legitimately based expressive activity felt threat person trying protect opposed explaining didnt act order suppress viewpoint asserted these kinds allegations often made and fact even manufactured scene intelligent person going subject arrest and i think complicated question causation exactly makes sense apply context objective screening form noprobablecause requirement hartman context retaliatory arrest yes thats correct justice scalia going next point once understand it makes sense apply rule context officers engage sort critical public  protective function secret service i think understand also makes sense apply situations law enforcement legitimately take account expressive activity engaged functions crowd control and contexts well going difficult disaggregate legitimate consideration expressive activity evidencing threat illegitimate desire suppress viewpoint i i think i  i would draw distinction justice breyer of course theres going factual situations well i think right i understand basis nervousness i guess question court whether benefits administrable acrosstheboard rule outweigh costs trying forge sort exceptions deal extreme hypotheticals we we done unscientific search use time frame reference court used hartman looking back 25 years look a sort standard lex law search youll see roughly 100 court appeals cases 450 district court cases i dont know im sure scores scores arrests thats correct and course talking cases get point opinion can found and obvious point depending court may see proliferation claims and certainly hope wouldnt case but i think  question whether makes sense acrosstheboard rule i guess i would echo petitioners counsel suggesting set considerations retaliatory prosecution context prosecutors act hypothesis illicit motives situations and court considered whether benefits acrosstheboard rule outweigh costs forging exception deal extreme circumstances and court said we want rule designed deal mine run cases dont want rule exceptionalcircumstances exception  point great deal litigation concerning cases fit within exception cases dont and court said thats rather like designing retirement plan deal possibility someone might win lottery thats footnote 10 hartman and i think similar considerations would weigh  counsel favor applying acrosstheboard objective noprobablecause screening context well and i think important understand well i  respect justice ginsburg i think case piece hartman two relevant respects your honor quite correct justice souters opinion focused fact two individuals play you situation dont base what opinion getting that creates complex issues causation prosecution context and i think complex causation really drove need objective acrosstheboard rule you kind complex causation problem reasons ive explained extremely difficult disentangle legitimate desire act get  suppress danger speech evidence illegitimate desire suppress viewpoint the immunity no the   i think courts decision whren example supposed even though probable cause equal protection claim proof could made  important in equal protection context including race different objective screen place stringent objective screen court announced armstrong well i think part  part reason first amendment expressive activity legitimately taken account precisely manifest danger whereas race ordinary case i think reason principles race context ordinarily relevant consideration and armstrong rule designed distinguish circumstances race  race motivation race wasnt motivation and serves purpose well but doesnt work well context first amendment activity legitimately taken account when case secret service agent overhears individual say hes going ask vice president many babies hes killed makes sense world secret service focus attention person well i think  nature intensity vehemence first amendment activity engaged inform officer whether circumstances present kind danger warrants law enforcement response so   law enforcement officer hes going subject potential liability individual says look werent reacting way i expressing views acting  reacting disagreed views wanted suppress and thats hard thing disentangle and problem back end results problem front end well happens front end officers outer margins might back mind concern acted based best intuitions kind law enforcement response warranted might later subject suit based mistaken assumption potentially ability convince jury acting based illegitimate desire suppress viewpoint rather legitimate desire i  i dont know its potentially i  i dont answer disposal justice breyer well  certainly know kinds interactions arise frequency i think publicity surrounding in candidly i didnt  didnt conduct search object mind so i  i cant give answer one way  one way i want make one additional point justice ginsburg response question posed applicability hartman one level applies rule apply concern complex causation issue well  well but way think applicability hartman  put cases spectrum on one end court hartman identified standard retaliation case court identified public employment archetypal example and end retaliatory prosecution courts thought sufficient concerns complicated causation made sense acrosstheboard objective rule now question could retaliatory arrest fit within spectrum is retaliatory prosecution side public employment side and couple reasons i think fits decidedly within retaliatory prosecution side one one ive given speech legitimately taken account creates complex causation but one sense flip side  public employment context standard fact pattern going involve longterm relationship employer employee time theres adverse action employee engages sort expressive activity aftermath employer undertakes adverse action termination now context makes sense infer may well illegitimate speech  speechsuppressive motivation work sense control period interactions employer employee predated expressive activity thats case dealing law enforcement in law enforcement context main onetime interaction officer suspect arrestee you dont prior relationship acts control and ask question whether based onetime relationship basis inferring speechsuppressing motivation work and legitimate officer take account speech deciding whether situation kind one law enforcement response warranted makes sense unlike public employment context apply objective acrosstheboard screening form noprobablecause requirement prosecutions it your honor of course thats exactly happens fourth amendment context thats  issue court devenpeck and court explained devenpeck makes sense objective probable cause inquiry rather subjective one i dont know reason  i dont know  precise contours harassment charges state court made i think mapped measure assault assault suspected  officer reichle effected arrest i think concern importing sort subjective probable cause dimension inquiry  asked know offense officer fact mind concerns drove court apply objective rule devenpeck including example would disuniformity similarly situated individuals would treated differently based purely happens officers mind thank you,267.0,381,18,i assume would include us marshals fbi agents so talking protective details does rule apply regardless degree animus agent alleged particular view expressed why difference  ordinary policemen policing authorized demonstration front court anywhere matter the people making demonstration  motivation make assertion oh reason arrested didnt like i talking so situation different illegitimate  look used word crowd control i take saying word crowd control making distinction do want rule automatic know immunity  sort automatic immunity  crowd control isnt issue history persecution individual particular officer da da da i mean know make cases did want absolutely across board going start making distinctions i mean i agree crowd control i see i see problem i see problem protecting people public life i see problem protecting president now far now given thats particular problem views likely evidentiary unpopular views actually unfortunately but far extend you say extend everything to jaywalking persecutions know thats whats making little nervous do sense many first amendment retaliatory claims jurisdictions permit  i know limited  many cases arise and many arrests year im sure millions even though  i think hartman justice souter gave two specific reasons neither apply context if prosecutor institutes charges suit prosecutor would absolutely immune so picture here one officer so would certainly extension hartman reason hartman gave rule tied  much tied prosecution rather arrest you might apply immunity selective enforcement based race yes well im  im aware reservation whren why difference fourteenth amendment equal protection first amendment speech what  crowd control you want extend crowd control well what difference first amendment make how  many cases  might know might information many cases 5 years whatever period actually federal protective officials retaliatory first amendment activity it would department wouldnt theyd keep track do know unique one us well looked research find case anyone ever asserted first amendment claim retaliation arrest federal protective official may i go back probable cause question i asked its like taillight 1001 came court this  situation may well warranted probable cause assault probable cause harassment but  1001  ones mind it seem quite strange but doesnt matter something comes court something   wasnt natural one would expect probable cause arrest assault harassment actual charges made thank counsel mr lane,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-9,-24,-523.0,-276.0

michigan courts the issue whether michigan supreme court unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court precedent rejecting mr smiths claim jury drawn fair crosssection community the michigan supreme court act unreasonably concluding unconstitutional underrepresentation systematic exclusion this courts decision duren require different result either point court reverse sixth circuit i think important note two prongs issue the fair reasonable representation prong systematic exclusion prong and also significant understand disparities issue relatively small time period issue runs  april 1993 october 1993 information  6 months processes play measured and percentage africanamericans appeared venires time period  comprised 6 percent venires juryeligible population 728 percent so  128 percent absolute disparity 6month time period that also measured 18 percent comparative disparity now compare disparities issue  issue duren really magnitude difference disparities duren involve exclusion women missouri comprised  women comprised 54 percent population 145 percent venires 8month period time well well youre looking michigan supreme court decision i think important note would incorrect would objectively unreasonable aedpa standard whats issue michigan supreme court unreasonably apply well yes yes your honor right that unreasonable i think best evidence fact decision unreasonable i  blue brief i put together table circuits done comparable statistical disparities and runs  first circuit tenth circuit i seven circuits worth opinions course really additional cases examine and look kinds disparities examined courts well  view court really didnt provide guidance duren measured in fact duren doesnt specify kind measurement tools used examining disparity well i think thats right and thats one reasons direct review courts virtually unanimous rejecting kinds small disparities so look table pages 32 33 circuits direct review comparable second circuit decision percentage distinct group community 708 percent jury pool 50 percent thats right at well kind first matter seems like court doesnt really reach hard question insofar michigan supreme courts decision entitled deference aedpa meaning okay no i understand i understand i want make kind first point now second point seems absolute disparity test better measure examining  examining questions and reason objectively captures number missing jurors part venire whereas 728 the 10 percent test really necessarily tied absolute disparity in words court could conclude absolute disparity test better test without using 10 percent threshold the reason i suggest 10 percent threshold thats really whats happening ground federal courts its hard find case theres thats right under  court adopted thats right if court it reflects actual practice courts  look well  seems  looking federal courts done theyve  theyve generally used multiple tests now several circuits relied 10 percent threshold necessary state prevail order court adopt 10 percent threshold i  i understand point the reason im suggesting threshold also corresponds practical aspect application rules the  sufficiently small absolute disparity matter probability likely affect actual composition petit jury right well  one concerns i i  example i know kent county look distinct groupsyou look 1990 census kent county comprised 2 point  29 percent latinoamericans 11 percent asianamericans 06 percent native americans now look one month thats placed issue mr smith indicating 35 percent comparative disparity one month becomes threshold standard used sixth circuit concluded  established violation second prong think practical application  michigan kent county take 158 jurors jury pool youd expect one month four five latinoamericans two asian  americans one native american whats missing  im sorry whats wrong that i that practice courts thats im  im advocating but correspond idea certain point absolute disparity practical  example case venire issue according state trial court included 60 prospective jurors three african  americans would constitute 5 percent now order percentage correspond exactly juryeligible population would one two african  american jurors part venire well matter probability 12 selected 60  kind point justice breyer   likely would effect actual selection petit jury i think thats right one  one reasons also  talking 10 percent rule  look cases youll see lot  lot courts direct review  i think  im going come back point course aedpa case question whether michigan supreme court acted unreasonably and i think theres different standard doesnt gotten right objectively unreasonable but setting aside youll find many cases disparities 5 percent 7 percent rejected and reason neutral processes processes everyone would agree reasonable face result disparities distinct groups right no im making  opposite point third im sorry please the duren case involved categorical distinction meaning women exempted different way men women automatic exemption this court didnt delineate duren disparate impact based neutral process that would sufficient give rise systematic exclusion and thats really way federal courts applied direct review i think may easiest way resolve case third prong michigan supreme court question jury assignment concluded mr smith failed factually show underrepresentation arose process the  information mr smiths expert provided   two jury terms described one 6 months juror assignment local courts first occurred 1 year following year jury assignment send local courts first so two different pools compared the  look page 13 blue brief outlines disparity according mr smiths expert time assignment local courts occurred and diagram shows end 18 percent comparative disparity and thats final column totals now thats occurred time jury assignment local courts occurred first the following year comparative disparity 15 percent  jurors sent local courts first in words difference 3 percent comparative disparity now one suggests 3 percent comparative disparity could  could justify claim violation duren its  statistically significant talk 3 percent comparative disparity 4 percent comparative disparity talking two three jurors entire time period no there  information  reason  michigan supreme court ultimately rejected claim jury assignment process evidence anecdotal testimony sending jurors local courts would result deficiency african  americans circuit court felony court  courts so basis they  way touches wood v allen it factual determination whether 2254d2 2254e1 the michigan supreme courts conclusion mr smith failed show factually underrepresentation arose jury assignment process entitled deference no theres  theres logical necessity sending courts  understand entire county county broken districts and districts local courts misdemeanor courts thats right but outlying areas also send jurors district court first its like one segment gets sent district court all jurors get sent district courts first the   proof required show somehow district court grand rapids went jurors local courts proportionately no   district courts  grand rapids rockford small municipalities  drew circuit court pool exactly in words proof thats right it take grand rapids people thats right thats happens youre drawing entire county im sorry i  ive  ive stated way thats misleading i apologize all jurors entire county drawn one pool and  local courts identify people came within jurisdiction draw everyone the  theres information  record indicates no the  district court grand rapids grand rapids residents youre exactly right it depends local courts usage jurors if  grand rapids actually required fewer jurors would  would result larger number africanamericans present circuit court the whole concept underlying claim  disproportionate effect idea grand rapids must needed proportionately jurors local courts might that would argument well wasnt really testimony whether good bad the  anecdotal information  took african  american jurors larger pool the anecdotal information court administrator we afraid process draining  siphoning language  siphoning jurors circuit court yes thats right it would create problem grand rapids thats right thats exactly right i think thats right thats exactly right nothing anecdotal testimony like example court administrator said believed process results reduction number jurors  africanamerican jurors thats right right and information provided thats one reasons michigan supreme court rejected claim factually demonstrated and fact look information mr smiths expert put forward really confirms  even best showing mr smith small correlation i mean youre talking 3 4 percent comparative disparity difference it would significant i dont think theres oh not  reading duren i dont think would  i dont think thats  proper rule and i  reason well i  i dont think numbers sufficient justify right and thats argument raised mr smith no i think answer and reason i say you  federal courts direct review looked voter registration challenges voter registration voter registration may disparate  affect distinct groups differently in way second tenth circuit looked cases failed follow nonreturns  dont follow nonreturns may affect distinct groups differently the analysis federal courts issue decisions exempt jury service failure respond invitation jury service outside system even occurs regularly persistent still inherent process thats michigan supreme court said excuses hardship transportation  excuses but also true process select jurors district courts something systematic exclusion anyone its  face neutral  court concludes neutral practices like sending  using certain body whether voter registration drivers licenses michigan identification cards following nonreturns allowing excuses hardship  assigning jurors district court first  result systematic exclusion whats going happen neutral processes michigan may result disparities and stands kent county doesnt identify race ethnicity jurors well going to going to perfect correspondence juryeligible population it longer kind blind neutrality thats true there  rebuttal but happens subject challenges the question does court  state ever wish  ever wish position subject challenge but  i think i want come back  one prevailing points this also michigan supreme court theres question reached merits entitled aedpa deference and  question was adequate guidance state michigan know systematic  systematic exclusion inherent process and duren clear point the  analysis michigan courts really corresponds quite closely federal courts done cannot objectively unreasonable and oh happens dont  people dont right drivers license still obtain identification card even able drive so trying get wide group possible pool jurors and thats right thats right i two brief points one  i want remind court case aedpa review michigan supreme court incorrect objectively unreasonable and conclusion i think probably easiest analysis conclusion showing systemic exclusion mr smith failed show underrepresentation arose jury assignment process probably one strongest points look 3 percent comparative disparity thats less half 1 percent absolute disparity no one claims thats statistically significant so i think whether reviewed 2254d2 2254e1 court reverse thank you,813.0,1194,42,well hear argument first morning case 081402 berghuis v smith mr restuccia the  i dont know relevant use years ago i took course kind thing kennedy school i teaching said way could figure  whats use something called 1000 balls 60 red 940 black select random  12 time you know fill 12  fill hundred 12 and tried interest i  i found would expect numbers something like third half juries would least one black person now may wrong i mathematician  putting together looks pretty big disparity on hand isnt testified i guess youre going tell ignore forget well know maybe way statistician stays urns i guess computer programs i  i dont know words maybe i  i hate write something like saying 2 2 6 but dont urns laughter no you skip want if theres comment fine i think point duren quite different numbers starting women 54 percent population dwindled 145 percent  jurors available jurors i guess point following youre going say 2 plus 2 6 i suppose aedpa say 2 plus 2 somewhere 3 5 right may i interrupt question goes justice ginsburg asked should treat areas depending  say  disparity jurisdiction 3 4 percent minority treated similarly jurisdiction 30 40 percent but isnt perfectly obvious youre going dramatic differences small percentage  grand rapids example major percentage duren but  i suppose thrust justice stevenss question small population concerned disparity substantial especially use comparative disparity and i think  least i interested aspect question yes halfhour id kind like know but  test 10 percent and minority 7 point  whatever 7 its 10 percent that would mean district free disregard people 10 percent population you would suggest population 9 percent group protected group didnt one person serve jury per year group that would  absolute disparity test using 10 percent figure would give rise kind suspicion it would meet durens second prong does make sense well i dont think  court suggested complete absence protected group kind number wouldnt give rise fair representation claim thats court michigan court many others said absolute disparity test cant used every circumstance i dont the question i  thats advocating least brief suggested wouldnt better us leave hands courts sort figure test better circumstances us announce flat rule would lead result like example i used well i agree protected group 1 percent population likely absence going give rise flags but i think difference i dont  i dont know statistically and leave judgment lower courts 1 9 1 10 difference makes sense and thats courts saying we cant use one test determine whats wrong yes whats wrong rule with rule with picking number rather leaving courts appeals district courts use different numbers different times i dont review cases time why dont pick number you want 10 right yes i dont know the one thing i learned urn business never turns way think laughter for example example like eight there eight hundred run thing thousand times youll discover one black juror half juries third anyway thats much i would thought intuitively and i might even read example correctly so see i  im sea soon tell statistician i even got book called statistician lawyers that didnt help much thats las vegas makes profit right laughter well depend doesnt size  urn in words smaller laughter if 10000 balls going go 10000 times likely going get sample reflects overall percentage correct are  saying systematic exclusion  assuming good faith intent discriminate systematic exclusion always proven disproven statistics well and ill  ill allow answer course if show systematic exclusion again assuming good faith intent discriminate the statistical issue interesting i  i wonder looking aedpa  court necessarily start question  elements prima facie  question whether unconstitutional underrepresentation end i understand duren defendant identify aspect jury selection process disproportionate impact group involved unreasonable and unless done outset struggle statistics now illustrate aspect jury selection process sixth circuit thought unreasonable prior practice choosing jurors first district courts misdemeanor courts rather circuit courts  felony courts but  trial judge seemed address  thoughtful way said isnt proof old system effect and hard see could effect unless  number jurors chosen district courts grand rapids disproportionate number chosen district courts jurisdictions within county so seems to end case and make sense  struggle rather complicated statistical problem end day going come something nature didnt michigan supreme court essentially justice alito suggested said well give benefit doubt go third but third seems theres nothing shows us representation district made change visàvis circuit courts that  thats  circuit court do know figures district court but isnt possible  awfully hard get percentages get small numbers but doesnt seem intuitively obvious give district courts first crack  size pool africanamerican potential jurors  bound impact right but  theres much higher percentage africanamericans grand rapids county whole but  jurors served district court  taken entire county grand rapids so district court jurors could  could include many jurors grand rapids could grand rapids i see im sorry that  im confused i thought way around i thought grand rapids gave however many  know 30 percent pool took grand rapids people back i  apparently communicating correctly right so so jurors served district court primarily grand rapids rather kent county whole well let ask factual question could put district court jurors come grand rapids so inevitably give district court jurors first pool africanamerican jurors going larger serving district court  felony court okay so anybody said whether   take jurors first districts grand rapids uses higher percentage jurors so  black jurors fewer left that could now  record anybody say whether thats okay i mean  people serve jury duty near live nearer live face bad did  anybody say whether good bad are do  resident district order serve juror district court you so system effect grand rapids take white jurors counties opposed larger percentage black jurors grand rapids youd claim grand rapids wouldnt well  youd jury pool grand rapids wouldnt reflect larger number blacks grand rapids so youre damned damned dont right so  evidence record  i gather whole claim depends upon grand rapids need jurors per capita anywhere else so evidence record thats case i would suppose thats something find pretty easily right i mean look see many jurors pulled  many jurors grand rapids needs particular period compare many jurors rockland needs let get if  procedure routinely results statistical underrepresentation significant clear showing systematic exclusion well yes  thats  hypothetical routinely results significant underrepresentation automatically systematic exclusion and would  gone systemic issue disparity marked  numbers i mean isnt  im trying think third prong  of duren isnt  routine predictable constant isnt always due systematic exclusion but concluding systematic doesnt mean defendant wins it means state  justify  mechanism thats causing  thats causing  situation one point information what michigan id let ask factual question am i correct understanding michigan fact changed practice regard giving priority yes thank counsel mr lawrence thank counsel the case submitted,930.0,1090,30,okay mr chief justice may please court if annual jury call minorities courthouse grand rapids 728 percent total number jurors called means happens detroit means almost nothing happens grand rapids thats every minority the petitioners goal court enshrine law rule two situations exactly well i think certainly adopt petitioners test 60 percent country duren would apply regarding african  americans 90 percent country wouldnt apply hispanics duren protections would never apply native americans anywhere well i would make observation that duren v missouri page 366 court stated his undisputed demonstration large discrepancy occurred occasionally every weekly venire period nearly year manifestly indicates cause representation systematic  inherent particular jury selection process utilized  well first thats completely correct however rule duren us supreme court stated numbers alone prove systematic then court on page 366 and  court went say state arguing theres various neutral benign reasons underrepresentation it well justice scalia reading duren indeed include third test problem is duren puts burden proof test state they said pages 368 369 state claiming sorts neutral legitimate reasons underrepresentation well show number systematic factors look duren page 366 says numbers alone proved on  366 stated duren well i believe met threeprong test i feel error reading duren say anything the state must show came defendant show it says pages 368 369 and well i would read one sentence duren i could assuming arguendo exemptions mentioned court would justify failure achieve fair community crosssection jury venires state must demonstrate exemptions caused underrepresentation complained  and i think courts along way including michigans supreme court overlooked important principle that thats right because jurors pulled district court many serve district court the majority still removed from overall pool i dont believe either side established well i would respectfully disagree court necessary view specific item led underrepresentation something thats unconstitutional rather collective nature 15 17 months persistently repeatedly came substantial underrepresentation you talking 348 percent well i feel i feel number factors i suppose could basis height surprised theres fewer women jury well record showed people actually showing jury panels circuit court heavily overrepresented rural areas kent county heavily underrepresented right well i guess yes well first grand rapids several district courts largest one district court city grand rapids and one would predict judicial business large city certainly going extensive judicial business rural areas well well i guess i would simply say court administrator testified district judge found substantial underrepresentation noticeable visible severe problem clients trial  concluded best way dealing end siphoning process well i well i two answers the first one  one thing eliminated spikes like clients month 348 even though average underrepresentation 181 okay well case duren youre talking  10month period involved numbers small i refer cases i much disagree  united states v sanchezlopez cited brief hispanics comprised 559 percent southern district idaho  court basically said since thats less 10 percent cares hispanics juries the united states okay well first kent county really big its  anybody drive farthest end county downtown grand rapids approximately 20 30 minutes it wouldnt difficult get i bet members court longer commute but importantly  fact youre talking 25 people 2250 people simply means problem easy court administrators solve incentive well statistics showed example africanamericans much higher rate automobile and say well trouble getting ride could tell somebody come anyway say thats right take day and african americans substantial higher rate singleparent households well course going harder get babysitter now tell people well thats okay stay home say try get anyway and court  somebody simply didnt show statistics shown brief no doubt thats true i saying wrong give real hardship exemptions here well case one things happened somebody didntsimply didnt show thats now judges  court administrator said yes tried the judges would issue orders show cause police department made decision going anything serving participation orders show cause orders show and isnt police department decision part system it systematic when police tell courts shouldnt courts tell police if find persistent month month problem society benefits jurors drawn broadest spectrum system well well overall theres nothing wrong granting excuses genuine hardship however factor factor 2 factor 3 factor 4 persistently come allwhite juries thats richard hillary testified 98 percent time nothing allwhite juries and somebody could well united states district court western district michigan covers large amount territory frankly i studied statistics i know personal knowledge african american population western district michigan would smaller kent county city grand rapids well mean united states district court no i  i studied situation i dont know court arrests people i  case wasnt question arresting the local judges made decision we going issue orders show cause people required come the police decided going anything and i feel thats part system police part system in order solve problem kent county would take people district court put back ones arent used that would certainly help instead take excess number like court excess people totally removed system that whats happening i dont believe we know  soon stopped created substantial increase number africanamericans juries i think thats at county level yes okay the  well testimony  well look  im sorry i dont page number right time said two three african  americans within group either 60 100 and im sorry record less clear even 3 60 youre talking 5 percent whereas population 728 percent if happens twice problem happens every month if two would right target  would be28 percent low simply send second letter testimony kim foster later started sending second letter half people respond would respond but step right direction want want promote minority participation jurors  juries instead creating rule tells court administrators country heats dont anything well one element entire system might insignificant talking numerous elements went together duren says show caused underrepresentation each district jurors acquired district circuit acquired districts county well i dont expect outlying districts  larger percentage blacks population im expecting county i think allow great deal flexibility local court administrators as i mentioned brief parents involved community schools case discussion concurrence justice kennedy exactly local governments  get appropriate representation minorities without using racial classifications well i admit different setting however i feel  well i wont say i feel duren holds must reasonable connection africanamericans appear jury arrays population whole well certainly correct i would simply say people grand rapids looked juries 98 percent time saw nothing white faces i think duren requires local system something theres lot options so give flexibility thank your honor,928.0,1364,43,if community one africanamerican argument would thats disparity that means every  every minority left jury i guess im  i guess im echoing justice stevenss question whether type statistical analysis really works youre dealing relatively small numbers yes dealing express exemption there exemption woman also record jury clerk sending notices saying women wish serve return summons judge named reverse side quickly possible and  systematic  card returned card sent woman returned automatically assumed wish serve there followup so kinds evidence systematic problems duren present where court say excuse you  statement true   theres third part threepart test i thought duren established threepart test and third one establish  already established disparity establish selection process caused disparity and telling us dont proceed step 3 once show disparity assumed product system oh  showing systematic factors it plaintiffs burden  defendant case duren  burden show systematic factor that automatic exception woman worked practice after justice white tells us state could still come back say yes thats true reasons women didnt show maybe disproportionately elderly maybe involved child care thats  thats duren said  showing systematic factor plaintiffs burden state could justify numbers came way how reconcile third test please tell reconcile statement fact set forth three  threeprong test where say where say it says state show reason good reason  aspect selection process identified causing disparity but say states obligation go every factor may cause disparity justify every one or defendants obligation point aspect selection   system causes disparity then defendant identifies state show  try show theres good reason do i understand siphoning theory depend upon grand rapids drawing disproportionate number jurors pool that results fewer minorities going county court right removed county where  record established grand rapids disproportionate need jurors pool well  theory depends upon grand rapids drawing disproportionate number record grand rapids drew disproportionate number i think means lose but thats factor sixth circuit identified illegitimate  siphoning system it rejected everything else didnt now  im clear mind why siphoning bad my impression may wrong  thousand people room lets say let district courts choose first people serve nearer live now  would rather serve nearer live and result could reasons stated fewer minorities general jurors draw wider area i dont know merits i mean i see negative i see positive so  doesnt seem obviously bad obviously good so i right well  thats explanation problem seeing the problem seeing grand rapids higher juror utilization rate higher minority population end leftover juries lower minority population now explanation choose district judges  choose district jurors first my question i  youre  im instructed area if tell i think i would say im sure i think fewer minorities thats true people get serve closer home now  enlighten little bit of course of course look proportional basis right grand rapids also sending higher number jurors pool  small rural county your  theory depends upon grand rapids drawing proportional number contributing 30 percent draws 30 percent theory depends upon grand rapids contributing 30 percent pool drawing 40 percent and  result it resulted 6month period difference 18 percent underrepresentation 15 percent and adversary says thats statistically meaningful difference 3 percent takes difference couple people change 18 15 whats  whats unreasonable argument you cant  comparing apples oranges prespike year postspike 6 months we dont know would happened  didnt statistics year longer well i wouldnt say i still havent  i try forget cases as im hearing im hearing well let  say wider area choose first get higher number minorities tiny number i mean small addition one two people and way theyre youll lose one two people let people serve closer home so i think  person judge  thats i letting answer judge  i mean id say well doesnt sound like much big deal and  i see advantage way tell whats  whats wrong how dont people become professional jurors they serve every jury youre going disproportion statistics show may i stop moment because one things duren opinion child care excuse would okay i think justice white said end im touching typical hardship excuses one child care  certainly early 70s going disproportionately affect women you far fewer women give child care exemption but  wasnt talking individual cases let let make sure i understand position assume  identifiable disparity 2 percent 3 percent whatever might get threshold significant thats entirely caused fact members minority personal excuses justify nonservice what do case do find  unconstitutional dont it its assuming i didnt well thats policy cant say that systematic exclusion part system but unconstitutional im trying find society benefits  make serve society benefits grant excuses is  federal district corresponds kent county is federal district court would calling jurors  geographical area but dont  dont comparable  comparable records going  district court yes are  courts know suggesting needs done when juror show judge issues bench warrant  police sent arrest person drag person court somebody says i single parent i children im poor nanny au pair therefore please excuse say find way getting are courts that mr sterling i dont  seem acknowledge make case show grand rapids district drew pool disproportionate number people why  prove if grand rapids contributes pool inordinate disproportionate number minority  blacks case  even grand rapids simply took back proportionate number pool would still disproportionate effect reducing number blacks overall pool wouldnt your answer justice scalias question  right because idea grand rapids sends pool thats 30 percent minority takes back number everybody else going get  county going get proportion its take back they heavily africanamerican pool going draw everybody else drawing fewer african  americans go county but evidence grand rapids takes back share proportionally anybody else at county level yes was evidence venire  minorities underrepresented venire where record help help  help math if one african  american would percentage pretty close youre saying right can go back point  big change draw came circuit first districts i thought agreed 18 percent average comparative difference 15 percent that doesnt sound like big change but step  step right direction enough you adducing prove prior system significant effect turned didnt significant effect it doesnt prove point say well step right direction if insignificant insignificant whether insignificant right direction wrong direction doesnt matter i still dont  i dont understand problem  show took back contributed lets assume grand rapids  entirely black entire delegation goes pool black okay and lets assume blacks 10 percent  totality blacks anywhere else okay then grand rapids takes back simply number people  took set would 10 percent takes black  takes back blacks grand rapids residents all districts would thereby zero percent blacks instead 10 percent ought exactly exactly so expect districts 10 percent blacks simply grand rapids contributed 10 percent totality black there  theres requirement district 10 percent blacks right but grand rapids takes back   people sent blacks left go around isnt case so if  grand  grand rapids uses disproportionate number jurors district courts going problem  way fix problem would separate jury system district courts if  circuit courts going first people district courts going problem identify if system done randomly  circuit court district court  people come toward end going problem so i dont see way fact statistical basis separate selection process district courts is think necessary all right so that question permitted here youre trying say required the schools case measures district could take wanted but saying measures district must take constitution requires they quite different settings what  i listen i think think lot things people could they could send three letters could explain letters important come could try reversing thing little bit districts first first  kinds things but  youre forcing legal rubric so decision wouldnt like probably would say cant say theyre unreasonable respect  knows you know get around others try et cetera in words unreasonablereasonable one standard ambiguity plays  role might helpful thank counsel mr restuccia 2 minutes

correct your honor the situation exist  yes discharges treated effluent plant both domestic sewage plant waste paper making operation treated effluent discharged we see discoloration far havent measured detrimental effects the sludge bed however remains bottom lake sitting land state new york we believe that sludge bed constitutes continuing nuisance continue decay take oxygen waters it

sludge would constitute threat ecology lake new york control waters new york owns land i assume new york could prevent international paper company removing sludge land  no didnt get far we got two conferences letter secretary interior suggesting action part state new york then secretary interior hickel left powers interior transferred epa requested action epa response negative point we havent seen action we invited join suit said concerned didnt care act point i understand  attached latest brief state new york indication state corresponded epa indicating recent study show nothing done thats correct john thats  thats right thats frustrating business attempting deal conferences federal government we way getting act dont care and i way knowing whether federal government disagrees position reason declined act gone fully we feel that sludge either removed water covered doesnt affect water quality future i sure record shows federal conferences held case corp engineers study suggested sand cover could laid sludge there disadvantage remedy already problem navigation course wouldnt solved leaving sludge i think thats one possibility accommodation two remedies dredge cover i think court take jurisdiction also would one problems would trying workout trying case mr chief justice may i please court i indicated prior recess seeking remedies case either removal sludge bed covering whichever seemed appropriate time remedy would receive remedy addition i indicate claim bill complaint money damages we sought years alternative relief litigation early 1960s new england interstate water pollution control compact state vermont began negotiations lasted period 10 years state new york seeking remedy situation existed lake champlain and i recited earlier federal water

administration studies dealt question best remedy situation one concluded major portion sludge bed come international paper company plant the studies concluded best remedy cessation discharge removal sludge technical committee conference concluded continued existence sludge bed lake would constitute continuing problem the defendants course disagree conclusion points reason have litigate case legal issues involved see primary legal issue whether  it sides boundary your honor it emanates new york side spilling vermont land i dont think well able prove sole cause theyre certainly major contributor i think prove the paper company alleges others also involved dont set quantities the federal study done pursuant first conference concluded major source bed paper company plant thats right south  ticonderoga its pass lake yes city  ticonderoga boundary plant along lake city ticonderoga place mill ticonderoga creek tributary running lake champlain about mile i believe as see major legal issues whether jurisdiction exclusive court contributing issue whether alternative forum whether principles ohio wind inaudible in addition legal question recently briefed asked court law applies we think legal issues turn controlled question whether new york properly party complaint the defendants claim simply alleging administration new york law failing control situation years case if assume new york laws subject would still situation existing sludge bed lies new york land new york control land situation they permitting permitted years continuation nuisance causing us harm think question resolved others fall line jurisdiction exclusive one maintenance public nuisance your honor thats correct property yes litigate court itll question federal common law thats position took recently submitted memorandum i dont think state vermont citizen purposes diversity 28 us code section 1251 provides forum exclusive forum litigate state versus state so long new york party litigation place bring suit i dont think  i understand law district court jurisdiction permit suit states yes your honor we dealing joint  yes your honor could i think thats problem if conclude state versus state look federal common law court treat case joint tortfeasors litigated i think court would apply federal common law defendants yes your honor i dont think your honor i think point substitute law controls would state law the choice law rules would apply erie railroad v tompkins i  i think would diversity case order get thats cant go in cases involving state versus states court consistently held kind cases governed interstate common law federal common law nuisance in suits states citizens states state involved law unclear i cant find clear holding  i would yes because i understand  well way i could understand get federal district court  i never understood case yes i acquainted your honor i dont fully understand it seems stand alone  i think i plaintiff suit federal court i would urge case i dont find law point time i afraid federal district court wouldnt let litigate therefore youd without forum youd end state court  yes thats one far i know no holding  thats correct well i understand wyandotte case said go back state court it direct plaintiff case go federal district court its possibly case may case if court take jurisdiction may well end back state court vermont but case would international paper company i dont believe could get complete relief argument mr chief justice may please court i represent international paper company our position litigation ill say outset threefold we agree vermont complaint state real justiciable claim state new york secondly court refuse exercise jurisdiction wyandotte thirdly far governing law goes governing law state vermonts claim new york federal law far vermonts claim international paper company goes state law before i get law id like perhaps amplify startly factual questions asked morning with respect question mr chief justice area involved i visited area i tramped two mills one closed new mill open i think try visualize part lake narrow almost like closing mouth funnel you fly latter part lake youll see latter part lake including ticonderoga crown point mudding throughout lake broadens gets clear much different the sludge bed lies northern ticonderoga creek empties lake champlain covers 300 acres some covered marsh grass in fact amused i see one colored postcards thats sold port ticonderoga shows view sludge bed aesthetically difficult proposition the area involved contrast whole area lake champlain limited area indeed finally mr justice stewart i believe mr justice blackmun talked new mill id like say word the paper company long concerned discharge problem old mill over five years ago planned new mill it cost 76 million it contains modern water treatment facilities available cost 34 million state vermont said morning problem discharges mill in fact drink water comes treatment facilities people done as fish life legitimate ecological concern disagree statement morning mr parker fish life improved substantially since discharge stopped old mill completely april 1971 going reversion minor poor fish life in fact true i understand conditions summer tests conducted firm inaudible favorable the temperature water rose high level soon normally stayed longer time i want emphasize mr weinberg said there long standing dispute best way deal bed mr chief justice youve mentioned possibility recovering there least three possibilities one leave it covered way second remove remove happens i want visualize bed light feathery substance mr dime ph stated mr wrickleshouse ph tested new york state supplement brief points its thick heavy bed any attempt dredge remove operation told would destroy ecological balance lake harmful fashion indeed  another question if remove put happens certainly would removed place fairly near lake done best evidence scientist says lot reach back lake removal seem realistic alternative now law i dont need add anything i think mr weinbergs position basically complaining states course actions maladministration new york laws however whether court exercise jurisdiction dont dispute court jurisdiction contend reasons policy principle militate exercise courts jurisdiction even insofar vermonts claim new york concerned state state claim way law developed understand even though jurisdiction given court state state cases exclusive mandatory in many cases court refused exercise jurisdiction strong compelling reasons policy in wyandotte state citizen case obviously distinct sense new york party well paper company contend considerations militated exercise courts jurisdiction wyandotte lead court refuse exercise jurisdiction these factors familiar i would like recite let facts case in wyandotte court pointed court would punished morass novel difficult scientific technical problems the existence manner treating sledge bed far know entirely novel that tried get best engineering experts could last summer look would advise us advise state new york ought done the mere differences come morning mr parkers statement mr weinbergs illustrate underline difficulties problems i think beyond argument court would take case master would plunged extremely difficult problem fact finding recommending i dont think answer vermont might suggest later on say master understand even master mr justice stone pointed georgia pennsylvania still remains court duty independently examining evidence moreover seems us court would entering area congress expressly refused preempt rather left states the policy course think would great court would withdrawn morass tort litigation arising water pollution expense ability deal ever broadening range problems come court massive numbers federally oriented if take case difficult us see pick choose pollution cases would sure come environmental concerns surround countries inaudible think inevitable would come we therefore suggest case resolved lower level we suggest proper course action court refuse take case remit vermont type procedure court said prevail matters conference concessions cooperation lower level things could resolved yes sir we contend your honor i get that sueable vermont sueable new york ready stand sued there question this really available alternative state vermont us insofar remedy goes theres doubt and ill put one side i want advert word availability administrative remedies contend vermont failed exhaust i would suggest court respectfully deciding whether exercise courts discretion take case nature one look long hard question whether state brings case seeks bring case fact exhausted administrative remedies circumstances well i dont know i would characterize exhaustion administrative remedies mr justice stewart i think could call primary jurisdiction might might well but point i dont think state come call upon really extraordinary remedy original jurisdiction court said time sparingly exercised unusual circumstances refused state vermont refused fall 1972 proceed engineering study mr weinberg leave court the door slammed seems novel state stand court try invoke original jurisdiction sparingly exercised called play water pollution cases raised host difficulties mr justice holmes spoke early 1900 72 years ago certainly easy today so i would suggest element strong element courts discretion availability alternative litigating board subject suits vermont we never questioned also new york also whether state made positive genuine effort exhaust administrative remedies i contrast case cases argued morning i think theres every difference yes sir i would think state vermont law mr justice white  i would think i think common law governs traditional nuisance its one oldest types complaint known mankind i would think  let clarify one thing may i you said sued vermont thing i think probably law place injury govern well i find hard accept hypothesis i arguendo sued new york i would think new york court would look vermont law thats place injury occurred no thrust injury harm visits across border vermont vermont shores thats injury occurs i think the existence bed mainly almost entirely state new york vermont citizens vermont putatively least complaint vermont sues parents patria quasi severan capacity people suffer the impact still across border i think state law vermont govern well  i sure case suggesting thinking your honor well case dealing apportionment interstate waters particularly another state contact i

controlling water pollution no i dont ive thought deal ive looked decisions talked desilve ph yesterday commissioner stern cited brief 357 us court stated uniformity always policy pointed bankruptcy act example validity transfer property fraud creditors governed laws states added could 50 different laws governing i dont see real inconsistency i admit i first thought case notion uniform federal common law blanketing rivers country seemed appealing but i think think realize court would would evolving new federal common law laying tier new federal common law nuisance top existing state law result would hinder help pressing problem pollution rides aback country would years people could know federal common law nuisance would yes sir there diversity i dont think your honor its straight complaint nuisance picks parts complaint file i would like add one thing  the case brought shortly one its class action we contested class action  john three plaintiffs landowners lessees along

is new plant discharging anything lake is admitted mr parker but action taken inaudible recently produced results mr parker cant state vermont get relieved international paper putting one side question state new york courts type wrong youve described under federal act got far attorney general how far get they declined act answer inquiry as i read section 10 federal act sub division g epa may request attorney general bring suit behalf united states secure bed there edit  hasnt changed must its pretty discretionary in respect mr parker enlighten vermont feel new york hasnt done point covering entire 300 acres record show kind coverage would required adequate thats i put question  i dont know whether six inches six feet coverage would requiring anything put would interference navigation unless interference navigation small part dredging operation first lets suspend lunch luncheon break mr parker may continue you 15 minutes remaining just move i understand sludge bed bottom lake new york side boundary and something record effect building many years contributors addition many  many contributors addition paper company paper company is  paper company sole cause and way southern tip lake down around port henry ticonderoga  is ticonderoga lake how far lake thank what cause action new york you saying new york letting sludge accumulate lake part thats federal common law nuisance could get federal district court if federal assume purposes argument federal common law nuisance litigate district court but got two suits got one international paper company one state i mean least got two parties we already inaudible could litigate international paper company district court and federal law would control but inaudible hasnt named new york sued federal district court sued international paper federal district court you would asking application law youd asking correct well there wouldnt diversity case definition you said state citizen another state wouldnt couldnt diversity case erie railroad rule applicable diversity cases well would  will supposes decision court would  governed federal common law instance weve never held what would say suing international paper alone court surely would case within jurisdiction claiming sludge bed nuisance now would asking every implication federal law wouldnt why would think different law would apply suing federal district court contract jurisdiction kind case you asking federal  suing federal question matter federal law well course hasnt really decided are acquainted pankey case tenth circuit well thats state assertionattempt laughter well lets assume  lets assume suing court international paper company alone court decided federal law applies identical suit facts state another company suit brought federal district court wouldnt think law would apply but inaudible didnt well way isnt anything either and authority pankey case what wyandotte say subject but perhaps i explain basis court understood state ohio asserting ohio cause action ohio nuisance law thank mr parker mr weinberg mr whipple you concede international papers amenable service process vermont its kind primary jurisdiction argument  in terms equitable law says state law control  lets assume sued vermont would governing law in new york what new york says  well sued  new york law maintenance sludge bed nuisance well saying vermont says injury occurring new york maintaining land sludge bed well know interstates river cases state sues private company applicable law well wyoming colorado litigation stream state private company didnt doctrine equitable portion federal law apply rather  no one state contact would see anything inconsistent position suggested perhaps might federal commonlaw nuisance cause action also safe one now mr whipple litigation inaudible client   united states district court vermont and federal jurisdiction bottomed not federal question diversity how far litigation gone i curious know whether  district court feels kind substantive law applicable who john representing towns people  thats propriety class thank mr whipple mr parker three minutes left i think,734.0,1207,4,mr chief justice may please court to accept case would undercut precisely court held wyandotte relief sought plaintiff virtually identical namely injunction alleged pollution water interstate lake damages therefore and it seems us wyandotte completely dispositive the court properly held case involving complex issues effect bottomed local law factual questions sharply contested in courts phrase novel scientific issues involved although concededly jurisdiction court precisely sort question court get entangled certainly mr justice stewart precisely point genuine controversy two states thats certainly true go beyond surface representation two states involved look realities case however seems close broad fact new york injected i dont want characterize new york injected certainly reason presence new york obtain sort possible jurisdiction court fact everything vermont wants want international paper its conceded record new york didnt contribute one scintilla pollution lake new york creating sludge bed china thats beyond dispute the sludge bed created international paper perhaps private parties well thats certainly true mr justice marshall it would federal common law nuisance case view law state proper party genuine claim relief existed new york now answer seems contrast situation previous case argued morning involving milwaukee new york diligent it’s actually aggressive dealing problem we forced international paper cleanup pollution causing lake champlain we took court the case cited original brief we obtained consent create consent judgment injunction directing international paper cease active pollution it’s conceded longer active pollution source and following represented enforcement conference vermont new york federal agencies parties represented would take whatever steps necessary appropriate abate pollution caused sludge bed pursuant entered pilot study vermont originally participated prior kicking traces subsequent study new york engaged highly respected independent consultant conclusion based study never controverted anyone except vermont lawsuit federal agency new york agency anyone else except vermont pollution active pollution completely ceased whatever damage sludge bed causing due active pollution lake fact problem dissipating sludge bed stabilizing the report copy summary appended supplemental brief plainly indicates fish returning portion lake various alternatives far safest one far practical far realistic environmental standpoint simply leave sludge bed alone what’s happening natural process stabilization fish marine life returning lake the thesis inaudible bubbling complained  that really goes within merits appropriateness remedy yes sir it’s simply unavoidable discuss seems context court said wyandotte whether prudence discretion ought accept case the first answer seems mr justice stewart issues state court perhaps even federal district court could address international paper ordered state court either vermont new york remove sludge bed point would injunction would new york wanted step new york courts well could question would litigated state court either vermont new york that’s one answer the second answer vermont alleges complaint part sludge bed territory now vermont much putting sludge bed new york virtually nothing that’s certainly true it’s highly speculative i think assume new york would attempt block injunction vermont could obtain one courts new york state yes something could litigated vermont international paper state courts new york wanted become party new york could certainly free intervene new york done plaintiff defendant numerous occasions courts i dont see reason couldn’t vermont courts well it’s even conceivable texas pankey sort federal cause action in event certainly two possibly three forums difficult factual questions could resolved new york wanted  no i dont see reason making new york defendant if new york wanted interpose assuming injunction granted mandatory injunction requiring sludge bed removed point new york elected step case could move intervene didnt would waived whatever objection so seems that’s reason court court hear case first instance in situations like mr justice rehnquist i personally involved new york simply executed consent private party remove whatever we case like involving pollution hudson marathon battery company the case heard southern district court it brought united states attorney new york made party defendant solely purpose intervened i believe solely purpose simply executed consent letting defendant consent decree go underwater land remove allegedly causing disturbance i think point remember regard one talks state owning underwater land owning water lake water pollution whether it’s done municipality sort industry could logic vermont asserting blamed state ohio sued wyandotte chemical company defendants case could sued state michigan province ontario wanted using logic depositing toxic material lake erie consequently responsibility state and happened would situation namely spurious injection state order provide sort bootstrap jurisdiction court fact improper everyone reasons court exercise prudence discretion rejected suit ohio wyandotte applicable there many state bodies including potomac right well great lakes hudson river delaware river others sort logic would apply obviously lands one side cross interstate boundaries the underwater land owned one state using reasoning vermont using could name state party defendant one plethora cases litigated court now contrast heard earlier case number 49 history i believe it’s fair say fair bit grapple serious pollution problem lake michigan part municipal authorities new york aggressively acted i indicated took state vermont – took international paper company court thereafter study summary appended brief courts permission i would like hand giving clerk conclusion argument copy full report vermont attempts steer around wyndotte case saying effect it’s clear sludge bed must removed fact agency jurisdiction sludge bed ever said the army engineers plenary jurisdiction state waters navigable waters never much suggested interference little navigation may exist part lake new york constant communication department interior would eca there letter new york’s state commission diamond ph secretary hickel next international papers first brief subsequent letter mr wrickleshouse ph there never reply letters indicated slightest displeasure part federal authorities course new york taking new york kept appraised continually there isn’t – problem vermont insists yes sir certainly authority abate impediment navigations vermont alleges it’s understanding mr justice douglas army engineers power  well dwell sort de minimis make way argument impediments navigations although never complained new york authorities except bringing suit  no i dont  vermont certainly alleges submit merit either claim direct contrast every pollution case court ever accepted including georgia tennessee copper michigan illinois rest serious dangerous epidemic large scale pollution interstate waters there nothing sort involved what sludge bed rapidly stabilizing event less half square mile size fact existing suit referred briefs im suggesting attractive im simply suggesting massive course action vermont insists put case proper context contrast georgia tennessee copper cases nearly event antedated whole arsenal statutory remedies available situation like any water pollution definition thats state body water states water lands sort sediment anything going fall lands owned one state and hold court jurisdiction solely basis would reflectively overrule wyandotte case involving interstate body water simply permit plaintiff state elect name state shares body water party defendant for reasons maintain vermont ample forum courts either state motion leave file complaint denied mr chief justice may please court it seems clear court well mind issues case i dont anything except i hate leave record reflecting new york allegations diligence suing international paper company case the discharges lake champlain occurred 45 years many many years suits whatsoever it several years vermont began pushing new york litigation initiated notable litigation ever sought preliminary injunction in fact happened case international paper company would come forward schedule abatement new york would agree delays numerous changes deadline time paper company finally construct began operation new mill point question lawsuit became moot unless questions i further,224.0,302,13,there one great big difference thought in wyandotte state defendant there controversy two states therefore courts  well jurisdiction existed court exclusive

though quote string agreed wyandotte state court decided case common law nuisance determination relied that wouldnt true federal common law nuisance would well mr weinberg doesnt also go new york maybe  new york state maybe necessary party the sludge bed largely sub  surface lake new york side line vermont’s intention way abate nuisance get rid remove sludge bed new york strenuously says that’s absolutely wrong thing so court order paper company remove sludge bed new york would step say i sorry enjoin removing sludge bed it’s territory isnt reason new york state might necessary party cleanup factual issues litigation visavis remedy  they would enjoin  removal sludge bed perhaps didnt understand  i directing questioning reason new york state might necessary party course could

exclusive use position we bound the hague convention cant answered yes cant answered yes and else us 0 xxx we resorting bound we resorting we bound the constitution says i dont understand case mr ford i understand solicitor general doesnt agree always resorted first instance does position differ solicitor general would say which wouldnt necessarily require resort hague procedures first instance right and i understand it would view least require resort first instance the hague procedures necessarily now position burden proof show procedures accommodate plaintiffs needs for example client foreign national client burden proof accommodation made well certainly foreign national going know procedures country better american litigant presumably dont think burden foreign national least go forward establish procedures are available foreign country well mr ford urging applicability the hague convention i admire statesmanship backing position exclusive must use back position left doctrine comity but didnt need the hague convention doctrine comity that presumably existed the hague convention even entered and i dont see obligation federal court consider sensitivities foreign governments increased whit existence the hague convention adopted so hague convention part argument i understand imposes rule where rule come it doesnt come the hague convention the hague convention exclusive right would existed the hague convention right so stop talking the hague convention and discussing whether matter comity american courts generally conduct discovery abroad permit discovery conducted abroad may i interrupt must used suppose plaintiff serves interrogatory place ad flying magazine could answer yes you say cant answer question without requiring resort the hague convention so must every sense it something could waive defense and didnt violate international treaties i understand and acted consistently convention i understand well must convention first resorted whenever defendant whenever party opposing discovery requests even officer corporate defendant subject jurisdiction american court could write letter says please send copy document still means go the hague convention even officer willing the statute i understand correctly would needed convention means say means at least convention exclusive wouldnt needed statute would true also american corporation french wholly owned subsidiary the american corporation could also say evidence request france insist follow procedures right even wholly owned subsidiary say general motors company like they could make objection i suppose i dont understand i understood response justice oconnor correctly isnt first use rule or first use rule substantially different solicitor general proposing right okay think always must first generally must first what always and would even though become clear past experience particular federal court federal courts state courts particular country particular signatory convention fact permitted procedures used properly right right are going answer question though are going answer question what experience does first use rule still apply so isnt absolute first use rule a court use factors say i trying understand position and experience warrants what exceptions might besides fact know particular foreign country wont fact allow procedures used properly anything else mr ford example havent countries party convention made article 23 reservation example documents requests documents honored isnt and american court party plaintiff example seeking production documents country article 23 reservation i asking proposal american court would well suppose know meaning country simply permit production documents now court version what position france today honoring requests

court look blocking statute waived dont sufficient record case your honor in case submit the hague evidence convention applicable discovery requested the court need go if court needs go course doesnt make analysis absolutely your honor it required used circumstances case your honor court certainly take consideration statute thats really twopronged test one the hague evidence convention apply secondly obtain information without subjecting someone violation french criminal law the societe internationale versus rogers case course dealt type situation long the hague evidence convention came in case course court required district court make comity analysis see whether imposing sanctions failure make discovery whether foreign national made good faith effort get around blocking statute words waive blocking statute thats right our position rather make comity analysis front make comity analysis discovery procedure falls apart cannot receive discovery blocking statute in words need comity analysis determine whether the hague evidence convention would applicable particular case initially but court gets road determine whether sanctions imposed foreign national course comity analysis made determine whether sanctions appropriate i understand thats opponents position your honor yes our position the hague evidence convention mandatory yes foreign national foreign country

section 636 your honor submission the hague evidence convention exclusive way one terms convention dont indicate well read order saying take depositions france the hague evidence convention applies i position federal rules civil procedure certainly allow us to require parties no your honor the total extent discovery case court and proceeded and course reason your honor subjected stay entered originally district court eighth circuit court appeals still stay day even wanted take additional depositions could your honor the hague convention cannot exclusive the results court finds exclusive particularly view frances adoption article 23 blocking statute significant effects regard litigation also economy country if the hague evidence convention exclusive argued parties case federal rules civil procedure necessarily would apply would include sanction provisions this submit would cause creation information havens example general motors using subsidiary house documents foreign country signatory the hague evidence convention adoption article 23 blocking statute an american litigant would able obtain documents secondly may well create offshore immunity in words america manufacturer may decide manufacture products foreign country subjected real sense liability country effectively thwart meaningful discovery to thwart meaningful discovery flies face fundamental principles countrys judicial system discovery critical cases without american litigants would hands tied unable proceed meaningfully litigation foreign nationals the court may want look fairness issue case it totally unfair allow french nationalized company subject personam jurisdiction united states court able shield pretrial discovery use the hague convention blocking statute hand time availability federal rules civil procedure liberal regard discovery positions used offensively domestic litigant domestic litigant opportunity use federal rules civil procedure a totally unfair situation i think united states adopted hague convention intent result reached that true your honor that true if your honor court united states court cannot compel individual transport france united states yes the united states court certainly power the court power force individual physically come united states if and remedy your honor that remedy sanctions available federal rules fail the jurisdiction court force no your honor there thank you,501.0,764,43,do agree eighth circuit error well opponent said everybody agreed yes requiring documents brought france well france believes hague convention covers production documents well disagree case go back doesnt see grounds exception well court agree the hague convention didnt reach documents did also say even even even applies exception i really puzzled article 3g convention says words the letter request shall specify documents property real personal inspected  now mean doesnt apply documents possessed party or application document production well may apply sense mandates procedure adopted least optional procedure could requested letter request could asked court follow the hague convention thought would advantageous you see using words doesnt apply really kind confusing term when use mean mandate following procedures conceivably would apply sense optional alternative available what mean say doesnt apply okay so say maybe court appeals said doesnt apply meant exclusive is saying well government france disagrees question well common law countries certainly think exclusive isnt and one issues resolve now even court even decide isnt exclusive think trial court obligation consider whether convention procedures could followed obtaining requested discovery and you dont think united states interests getting information might affected international concerns degree court consider question well disagree court point believe document presently foreign soil taken produced think something would trigger the hague convention possible procedure use must trial court think international concerns but letter foreign minister indicating possible availability procedure do know adopted french legislature order binding france well speculating happens court district court orders man go get documents france locks how could help how help jail you feel sorry what french lawyer goes france representing french company subject sort sanctions french government attempting comply district court discovery order do think district court focus solely concerns litigants get information pertinent lawsuit ignore foreign policy considerations making sort determination when say applicable saying i take it would available chose use terms required used what the hague convention suppose france blocking statute the hague convention didnt exist in situation think district court would obligation consider situation putting litigant compelling information handed perhaps means could devised so inapplicability the hague statute really irrelevant even accept position maybe particular procedure the hague convention usable district court still consider dealing foreign litigant kind situation discovery order putting so argument applicability the hague convention merely goes manner comity decision made it doesnt go whether make kind comity judgment do understand opponents say american plaintiff wants take deposition french national french national completely willing deposition taken french soil go official authority done and defendants case said well quite willing furnish documents position the hague convention wholly aside blocking statute would prevent yes could defendants simply produced documents without complying without regard the hague convention yes opponents say hague convention would forbid voluntarily producing documents yes right well presumably could waive procedures required the hague convention voluntarily like procedures cant you say going to go discovery motion i produce you case like anything else but voluntarily turn trouble france is true but read statute treaty turn voluntarily wouldnt violating treaty that i meant say i sorry yes i meant say would violating blocking statute and would subject jail to people like fine bad jail 0 generallaughter one way find mr doyle 0 xxx that would one way find did client explore case whether requested information example advertisements united states could obtained sources outside france mr doyle district court order i remember correctly permitted take depositions france permit go ahead take have taken depositions yet who district judge well i asked i thought magistrates case district courts case mr doyle order says discovery depositions undertaken court require compliance the hague convention it doesnt say undertaken france that i thought france you say i misread order that says oh i see i see saying but havent taken depositions united states either well even theory cant get equality i mean acknowledge cant take depositions france federal rules right so way get parity do acknowledge couldnt compel officer opposing party appear united states give testimony no i talking individual you got corporate defendant you say dont think could serve notice produce president corporation knowledge whole matter united states testimony well tell corporation dismiss strike answer dont show something like there sorts sanctions do contend difference power forgetting convention power federal district judge order officer american corporation say office new york testify iowa california officer french corporation

without consent foreign nation however matter concerns strictly production documents interrogatories case no no your honor there statement page 6 falzon brief mentioned exclusivity said strictly within confines depositions foreign soil we still believe depositions could taken united states without violation nations judicial sovereignty yes correct your honor by reason believe customary international law general view foreign nations would violation sovereignty united states willing honor viewpoint even though might necessarily agree fully no would quite apart the hague convention the problem your honor your honor yes right prior formulation the hague convention issues typically arose case depositions take place foreign soil in number cases american litigants simply went foreign country attempted take depositions fact genesis convention for part that correct your honor now your honor weighs in way foreign nations generally view the hague convention exclusive the united states view supplements american procedures obtaining evidence it impose obligations united states response question justice scalia particularly receiving state we meet minimum requirements providing evidence foreign countries likewise but respect comity analysis conflict right exists fact view supplemental matter parties united states typically choose among discovery methods might use the respondents free use convention wish american laws mandated this conflict arises need comity type analysis again justice marshall things must must provide evidence specified foreign nation requests yes the hague convention says requests foreign as receiving state correct your honor yes provides supplement your honor yes treaty mandatory insofar must provide evidence foreign countries now court adjudicating transnational dispute faced choice employing the hague convention using traditional american discovery methods combination methods petitioners contend court must always choose convention least first instance obtain foreign evidence we disagree our view first nothing convention indicates first use requirement nothing ratification history indicates first use requirement well furthermore petitioners rule rests assumption the hague convention always produce fair effective efficient discovery matter subject considerable debate your honor problem domestic plaintiff forced go first resort convention may fact encounter many obstacles forced give lawsuit then would controlling there would doubt congress fact made declaration explicit yes your honor record rather unclear quite frankly extent congress expected matters used even first instance we believe court identify principles control comity analysis for instance think important foreign nation identify foreign interest reason use the hague convention necessary within country we also believe court stress yes your honor believe that yes your honor statement foreign nation objects able point specific policies foreign nation believe generally suffice show legitimate foreign interest now foreign interests entitled greater weight greater comity perhaps interests for instance believe court could reasonably conclude privacy interests nation instance trade secret laws require use the hague convention well yes your honor brings another problem these issues typically arising context protective orders fact mechanism federal rules yes true your honor yes now your honor respect record created believe petitioners obligation sort explain law works whether discovery could obtained case yes your honor we believe case vacated remanded fuller comity analysis we believe record really adequate conduct sort comity analysis discussing in case difficult speak burdens situation instead we believe domestic litigant obligation identify types discovery feels necessary and return petitioner indicate foreign litigant indicate whether discovery could obtained use convention they best position provide sort information your honor may i answer question my time expired yes our view societe internationale v rogers controls inquiry in situations may appropriate district court order production even though might violate foreign law well first real question whether laws fact applied french citizens there question whether yes your honor thank you,255.0,408,26,now mr minear sg appears changed position regarding use the hague convention well i reread briefs filed sg certainly appears way yes now taking depositions adhere position the hague convention procedures exclusive but france example case by reason the hague convention reason principle it would nothing the hague convention why current position anything the hague convention i mean either the hague convention mandatory case use it mandatory supplement procedures countries make information available abroad right it either one latter i dont see creates new rule comity didnt exist it mainly alters procedures civil law countries right so didnt use comity respect england are aware federal court felt compelled discovery matter withhold action use british internal procedures obtaining information resorted but werent third party depositions cost part well mr minear fact country entered the hague convention weigh comity balance is factor comity analysis how get treaty comity treaty opposite comity treaty must you must follow the hague convention period but i mean comity involved the treaty constitution says treaty and binds everybody including us department justice well perfectly fair position even comity wouldnt required resorting foreign mechanisms first instance perfectly fair argue the hague convention require matter comity would said i know why why say the hague convention require first resort well requires first resort i sure what congress many words said resort the hague convention federal cases otherwise so talking basically stringent provisions the hague convention know impetus congress gave executive gave require sort use get ordinary discovery proceedings well construe say the hague convention require exclusive use first resort decide anything else do get comity or issue effect the hague convention are supposed case is point each case find foreign interest considerations affect district courts comity analysis but case didnt take position discovery except pursuant the hague convention they didnt put facts say anything special lawsuit yes dont say motion limit discovery got trade secret problem case got sensitive didnt but didnt ask anything except 100 percent protective order and even district judge said must take depositions france he independently do think made kind showing requires reversal case is showing made case enough justify reversal governments position that really i driving who burden supplementing record well somebody got go forward judge first well done so going order somebody violate laws france go right ahead and get man arrested convicted you court going determine law france put jail france going decide thank mr minear we hear mr doyle,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,3,7,72.0,-31.0

state court railroad employee maynard employer durham southern railway company provisions federal employers liability act growing injuries received august 22nd 1955 the case came trail wake county superior court april 1959 superior court north carolinas inaudible highest court railroads motion nonsuit granted end evidence without juries opportunity passing issues the supreme court appeal affirmed superior court one justice dissenting thereafter  united states supreme court granted writ 27 june 1960 the petitioner seriously injured assisting loading one railroads motor trucks in bar petitioners rights railroad pleaded offered evidence release signed petitioner plaintiff petitioner attacks validity attack validity purported release two grounds one unsupported consideration whatsoever execution procured fraud misrepresentation undue influence now please court since railroad conceded open court north carolina supreme court  probably evidence offered petitioner sufficient take case jury issue negligence would appear unnecessary take courts time reciting minute details plaintiffs serious injuries occurred loading truck with background let us consider evidence favorable petitioner respect execution release following injury petitioner job approximate two weeks required see several doctors able return work around middle september 1955 thereafter saturday september 17 1955 petitioner went office defendant railroads general manager get pay check the petitioner produced evidence date defendant railroad owed 14460 back wages there two men office general manager petitioner general manager others when petitioner requested pay check general manager took piece paper desk drawer keeping partially covered hand pushed across desk petitioner told petitioner sign he didnt take hand paper testified petitioner i remember distinctly mr mcallister kept hand testified he also testified even given chance read paper petitioner thought signing pay check testified testified ordinarily received pay check saturday  also saturday he would signed paper known release never paid anything  never paid anything injuries  signed thought receipt now petitioner urges evidence two jury questions properly two jury questions one question fraud whether procured fraud second complete lack consideration alleged in making contentions petitioner rely evidentiary factual propositions we feel supreme court north carolina simply misinterpreted ignored vast federal questions authorities subject releases first fraud dice versus akron canton  youngstown railroad considered court 342 us 1952 seems appears leading case last time court considered question releases  fraud procurement releases federal employers liability act there petitioner alleged owed 900 railroad went get pay check railroad told merely signing receipt turned release liability personal injuries yes your honor court say  deliberate false statements made deceive deceive case here principal case false deceptive silence made deceive deceive we situation general manager knew plaintiff hurt hed come pay check kept socalled release partially covered hand interview alone knows  your honor feel  feel

plaintiff clearly gives evidence owing time execution release owed 14460 the north carolina supreme court never treated total lack consideration opinion on inadequacy consideration discuss opinion course record they said near inadequacy consideration alone insufficient cited immediate state court cases they cited nevadas case williams case intermediate cases illinois missouri authority holding time consider complete lack consideration brief burns case coming eight circuit hogue case certain district court reasonably logically say require release supported consideration supported consideration nullity therefore  yes your honor yes your honor yes your honor we feel north carolina decided federal question substance accord decisions federal courts merely evidentiary factual proposition court case and case permitted stay become authority erroneous state decisions federal employers liability act he dissented write voice overlap dissenting opinion thats one places record complain two three others your honor one page 21 “i thought i sign pay check time railroad owed 14465 labor  21 i never received anything railroad result injury i described today  theres i think page 26 transcript similar statement in respect 14460 petitioner states due defendant railroad never offered evidence effect petitioner entitled 14460 there main witness mr mcallister never testified man due 14460 labor all general manager testified told petitioner “it would necessary sign release settling up” so  record 45 your honor so would think   really going make lot 14460 used petitioner would put evidence now respect witness say policy railroad i want say first evidence petitioner ever knew socalled policy witness ever informed petitioner socalled policy all that witness referred testified  page 34 follows i know policy company  anyone had come back work get wages unless sign release i knew  i knew policy durham  southern railway company ever since i known anything that dont get wages work unless sign release didnt say anything injuries goes next paragraph likewise man injured called upon sign release gets money never  witness tried establish policy never said release required he uses word called upon that i think synonymous asked sign release even witness may much never said necessary sign release getting money and finally say north carolina supreme court never considered subject lack consideration   total lack consideration no way decision i see  point even considered court say particular ignore federal authorities never discussing complete lack consideration they discuss inadequacy consideration  length cited particularly inaudible williams cases two state intermediate cases dealt entirely within adequacy consideration yes your honor your honor  i  i believe

applied wrong standard isnt determination whatever appropriate standard proofs sufficient raise jury question voice overlap words deficiency quantum proof isnt basis turned now fraud question one consideration i mean    isnt point really justice brennan suggested question  put little way say ignored federal authorities authorities upon rely i gather cases upheld  facts cases jury question presented isnt youre asking right go jury on  issues on issue fraud issue one lack   federal consideration way lack consideration voice overlap 14460 pay wasnt its point evidence  least jury question although  consideration supporting release because apparently court held evidence record support contention entitled 14460 wages and suggestion evidence upon jury make finding thus find  release supported consideration did judge parker write  dissented didnt  notice anything now last point mr blanchard i notice page 31 complete transcript isnt narrative point transcript is evidence suggest presented jury question redirect examination page 31 “the 14460 i receive mr mcallister injuries pay check” what page thank mr nye  reading may i ask question pleadings i dont quite understand the defendants pleaded release thats amendment procedures you filed something called reply thats call replication you call replication north carolina in  paragraph 4 replication said amount paid far release damages wages due what followed  pleading followed court  reference point this raises issue whether payment injury payment wages replication and put  well thats says thats charge that  become issue necessary old pleadings deny wanted deny i dont know its deemed denied inaudible then offer evidence point wages due offer he pointed thought raised point voice overlap  what referred referred total relevant evidence point as i understand inaudible theres dispute paid wages time got inaudible the issue whether entitled wages time injured trying sign release but evidence beside much reference policy company men injured whether could pay he  mean voice overlap ,816.0,1255,8,mr chief justice i like say first nothing record suggest north carolina supreme court rule accordance applicable federal authorities it stipulated trial court record show case decided federal law the supreme court north carolina recognized case decided federal law it recognized problem it says “the question determined whether issue fraud lack consideration go jury” so i arguing nonsuit motion law conflict there law i know petitioner cited i fundamental disagreement now raised two questions petition he cited two questions brief discussed questions he raised five points discussed five points i would like mark  remark briefly five points his first point federal state law prevails conceded conceded trial court conceded supreme north carolina his second point defendant concedes evidence sufficient take case jury plaintiff signed socalled release in supreme court north carolina statement evidence properly sufficient go jury negligence release existed read evidence enough evidence negligence there enough evidence injury support jury verdict negligence damages question supreme court court bearing entire picture action no sir that raised support petitioners brief petitioners point 3 “only preponderance greater weight evidence required set signed release the supreme court north carolina stated recognized federal principle it conceded brief that law petitioners point 4 socalled release unsupported consideration therefore void id like say  connection now follow petitioners logic extent i file action wrongful death bring deceased court testify dead weve got conflict evidence go jury whether hes dead now call cow mule cow mule the  plaintiff testified various times  dealt much labor dealt much wages page 26 come clear judge cant close eyes recognize truth comes i know standing policy durham  southern railway company employee injured railroad would pay injured employee upon signing release thats important plaintiffs witness labor supervisor stated policy forty years plaintiffs evidence now i thought    the plaintiff testified put labor supervisor witness on crossexamination mr bailey testified forty years policy railroad employee injured work came back regardless responsibility paid back wages consideration sign release thats plaintiffs evidence yes sir  labor representative union labor representative and testified position sure employees get fair break now petitioner testifies wages i thought paying i mean i hadnt discharged railroad i wasnt able work i never discharged i expected wages i working i figured mine i never discharged form railroad i hurt now due wages labor now playing words facts four five days the  railroad gave equivalent salary signed release now thats consideration one reads record inconceivable could come theory that due labor referred labor referred wages but cow mule refer back forth truth came no sir no sir the man worked sea board nine years your honor came government apprentice foreman he educated  went 10th grade  reference check testified different place i usually sign check thats regular word he testified usually didnt sign things without looking question consideration opinion one read entire record state hed labored wages it equivalent  would receive worked your honor   stopped  yes sir yes sir now side remark petitioner brief stated saturday normal work day the evidence said normal work day thats  thats record says yes sir thats voice overlap   supreme court north carolina yes sir now i think important get  what  act  cannot read otherwise he  says “i didnt know policy” but says “i didnt work i felt  that right but witness next witness testified 40year policy railroads witness this based fraud your honor  mistake now paid alleged state instead vicious inaudible might didnt allege mistake they didnt offer evidence concerning mistake that brings us next point well question  i dont think  the one consideration which big difference  period state  yes sir they tried set aside thats right sir well first point i show little bit consideration small related portion said consideration the next part execution socalled release procured fraud misrepresentations undue influence part defendants agents required submission jury heres evidence respect page 25 record now two estimates executed hurt august 27th says august 23rd accident report signed petitioner referring page 25 accident report it states i would probably disability none expected i didnt expect much disability time i didnt know bad disability time i didnt expect permanent disability i thought mild back sprain i would get weeks month when i signed answer problem disability i mean time days release at time i filled accident report i idea i would ever get lawsuit back now days later signs release evidence concerning now  evidence shows accident report signed apex north carolina says disability everything held properly set mcallister durham north carolina days petitioner went durham signed release the evidence mcallister knew nothing accident nothing facts except set forth accident report signed maynard says “when i signed i didnt think ill hurting” so page 31 talking day signed release i know i  i know im signing day i curiosity i thought i signing check i assumed thats i it different place i usually signed check i havent  goes back personnel injury report i admit signing personnel injury report i dont remember time sign i couldnt say if i knew personnel injury report time signed id usually dont sign papers knowing now get back release fellow say used duress fraud mr mcallister didnt tell anything didnt tell story ask particular day i dont know  i didnt know long future i still thought temporary what mr mcallister defraud mr mcallister didnt know things put  accident report and  certainly plaintiff thought temporary nothing defraud nothing mcallister make  misrepresentation time that could mutual mistake were mutual mistake at time i didnt know  i signing wouldnt sign testify at time mr mcallister didnt know disability might future injury he didnt make false misrepresentation the thing didnt explain paper he didnt make deceitful suggestions he didnt make fraudulent suggestions he put paper i signed got check left i didnt think i going pertinent future what misrepresent man apprentice foreman would railroad 9 10 11 years record shows talked union representative filed accident report knew negotiations went labor representatives the trial judge heard evidence nonsuited the supreme court north carolina fully fairly recognized every question presented and i state one question court and question question determination whether plaintiffs evidence supporting  allegations release without consideration rather procured means fraud duress sufficient warrant submission jury i quoted question court page 55 record quote decision north carolina supreme court now supreme court recognized there evidence record us support contention plaintiff entitled matter right 14460 wages time work alleged injuries therefore unless release procured fraud duress alleged plaintiffs reply appropriate matter pleading defendants answer judgement nonsuit entered court must upheld as supreme court north carolina construes evidence show fraud duress part defendant agency but contrary testimony negates allegations respect in opinion plaintiff defendant entered release good faith neither party time execution release idea plaintiff sustained injury might would develop permanent disability there may mutual mistake part plaintiff defendant respect alleged relied cohen versus pennsylvania railroad supra however instant case plaintiffs cause action mere mistake fraud duress in light record us applicable decisions bearing thereon constrained hold ruling court must upheld so thats reason i say “were arguing motion nonsuit” the record gets smaller smaller comes trial court but truth came trial call cow mule still cow he referred labor referred wages record plaintiffs evidence shows small consideration consideration they based answer  insignificant consideration mutual mistake they based action vicious reply alleging types fraud duress time i repeat nothing mcallister representation,103.0,170,5,but  thats question us voice overlap  he stated   would  would mind making last statement i didnt quite understand the supervisor employed company oh i see well  supervisor say man knew policy he well  there rather inaudible given number days inaudible prevented  it   equivalent given number days well point i gather even  time would paid wages compensation but    order give  would execute release company willing pay equivalent would wages worked and youre pointing effect admission is  well also says  still i  i thought paying in words hes taking position  understanding even though hurt hed compensated time  wages would received working but witness didnt testify knew policy isnt difference but fraud issue colloquy i talking federal consideration lack consideration well arent questions one fraud lack consideration no consideration

state without consent this court upheld unconsented waivers state sovereign immunity two discrete circumstances first either united states another state sue state suits court declared essential plan convention and second congress statute abrogate state sovereign immunity long clear textual statement congress really intended the effort show suits states indian tribes either essential plan convention approved clear textual statement congress withstand scrutiny with respect essential plan convention quite unlike united states states neither foreign governments indian tribes figured various compromises arrangements convention consisted the major players conventions plan course states it surrender sovereign prerogatives brought existence new constitution new republic united states all sides agree stated well opponents shred evidence ability indian tribes sue states even remotely view time constitutional convention no justice oconnor thank asking question we giving point a tactical judgment made along line address we would welcome victory either ground on merits agree completely judge kozinski say substantial federal question the point disagree judge kozinski is easier ground we think and reason injunctive relief happened would happen future that course governed 1985 statute passed alaska legislature i cant see possible way anyone take position federal law fourteenth amendment otherwise prohibits state lengthening list possible recipients now i realize that also goes question youre asking substantial federal question the reason feel easier cleaner better ground reversal ninth circuits judgment sovereign immunity rather substantial federal question course jurisdictional twofold the first respective burdens imposed two doctrines on one hand hagans v lavine bell v hood others burden us stage game show federal question attenuated obviously frivolous whereas court made quite clear id like explain moment burden establishing sovereign immunity exist course respondents similarly heavy one the second reason pertains really courts considerations well case decided hagans v lavine grounds becomes rather inconsequential footnote hagans v lavine makes difference anyone courtroom whereas sovereign immunity issue involves conflict circuits its one affects clients deeply it two circuits involved two major indian population circuits need resolved so victory either ground would unwelcome would urge court concentrate courts ninth circuits sovereign immunity error that correct coming back concession i really regard concession respondents constitution makers simply indian tribes view acknowledged fact supports petitioner respondents the issue whether sufficiently compelling case made overcome sovereign immunity bar burden i mentioned moment ago respondents petitioners both that correct that correct probably best statement incidentally appears brief academy state local governments really sovereign immunity united states states preexist eleventh amendment i would ask respect consider anomaly would result ninth circuits judgment remains law would mean indian tribes participants either convention eleventh amendment proceedings would able sue states states participants ceded powers made convention possible could sue tribes and surely one say straight face that kind result part plan convention oh much higher insofar plan convention concerned yes yes but thats anomaly thats anomaly yes mr chief justice that correct and respect something give something get compromise states could sue but points unevenhandedness no one disputes state alaska cannot sue tribe probably principal argument what that correct the argument probably principal argument ninth circuit relies indeed whole opinion rests foundation naked indian commerce clause absence affirmative congressional enactment somehow waives state sovereign immunity that argument proves much along two separate dimensions first unexercised congressional power regulate commerce foreign nations various states several states among indian tribes waives state sovereign immunity suits brought indian tribes also suits brought plaintiffs two constitutionally recognized commercial categories namely exactly exactly and monaco v mississippi also state commercial plaintiffs interstate commercial plaintiffs similarly bare existence congressional lawmaking power waives immunity also waiver suits brought states plaintiffs bankruptcy cases patent cases admiralty cases second even important well established congress assumed waived sovereign immunity waived states sovereign immunity unless clear textual statement effect surely law cannot otherwise congress simply authority act done it makes sense say something less clear congressional textual statement suffice statement and brings us argument congress enacting 28 usc section 1362 satisfied clear statement rule not even ninth circuit agrees proposition even casual examination statute reveals section 1362 statute deals way sovereign immunity it solely jurisdictional statute it even mention states it even mention sovereign immunity there statement clear textual the respondents appear recognize much strongest argument respect 1362 clear statement rule apply statute adopted 1964 pardon came mid1980s court series cases probably pennhurst clearly atascadero welch dellmuth laid clear statement rule aside inherent illogic i submit inherently illogical argument would necessarily apply statute adopted 1973 date enactment section 504 rehabilitation act issue atascadero 1975 date education handicapped act statute involved dellmuth indeed argument respondents make respect ought one constitutional rule applicable one 20year period another one else history expressly made addressed rejected courts recent pronouncement area dellmuth v muth after first observing unlikelihood congress really education handicapped act trying draw coy little hints thats courts language meaning eleventh amendment court goes say the salient point view cannot said perfect confidence congress fact intended 1975 abrogate sovereign immunity imperfect confidence suffice given special constitutional concerns area that statement correct statement law applies much 1966 statute 1973 statute respondents argument comes 2 years late were told however indian tribes able sue states united states could bring suit the right united states bring suits indians behalf cuts solidly favor sovereign immunity one firmest pillars eleventh amendment generally sovereign immunity jurisprudence constitutional right lightly abrogated but federal government right abrogate it either two ways first congress abrogate long passes statute clearly says right text congress intended and way federal government abrogate executive branch bringing suit what plaintiffs really asking rule would set aside sovereign immunity cases federal government made united states made necessary judgment call suit state warranted given intrusion one sovereign prerogatives another suits necessarily now thats one i hadnt thought i remember nevada hall well course i dont see yeah i remember it citizen california brought suit nevada brought suit state court well found sovereign immunity hall certainly indian tribe as im might might im asking rehearing nevada v hall laughter i one state worry another but see nevada v hall long antedated i think fairness regard rule began emerge within last 6 7 years the clear statement rule yes there congressional statement whatsoever i think brought state court state court california i remember yes i dont think one really really affects really affects analysis similarly unpersuasive contention reasons alluded moment ago chief justice sovereign immunity applies suits individuals governments assuming moment respondents qualify governments and course squarely rejected holding monaco v mississippi respondents concede but explanation monaco v mississippi subterfuge involved case the assignment confederate state bonds individual holders government the individuals couldnt bring suit assigned government government could there two problems with argument first court simply didnt rely argument and second proves much identical circumstance assignment confederate state bonds individual holders state precisely issue leading case standing proposition state sue another state namely south dakota v north carolina and indeed south dakota v north carolina argument made rejected the real difference i submit whether individual government the difference really matters plan convention the states federal government participants convention suits either essential conventions plan now court agrees position concerning sovereign immunity need never reach question i get i see complex difficult would farranging consequences and assume entity indian related sue state determine indianrelated entities the one thing clear ninth circuits rule issue cannot law court done take two statutes whose coverage definition include far tribes whose purposes nothing either sovereign immunity section 1362 declare group natives covered either indian reorganization act alaska native claims settlement act automatically state sovereign immunity defenses waived favor suit bring state it would mean example nativeowned fishermens cooperatives purely commercial ventures i would assume residential neighborhood watch associations composed native members could sue state the reason indian reorganization act one incorporation reference statutes ninth circuit used extends tribes also im quoting groups groups common bond occupation association residence youre led conclusion judge kozinskis footnote issue probably right extends group natives kind native american membership common bond association eleventh amendment sovereign immunity waived suits brought finally perhaps worst ninth circuits rule would make shambles existing sovereign immunity principles reason you start proposition even ninth circuit agrees section 1362 waive sovereign immunity yet end rule rule group plaintiffs far broader far broader identified 1362 sovereign immunity waived mr chief justice unless court questions ill save rest time ill use one two brief points mr chief justice i find nothing less extraordinary proposition suits tribes states built conventions plan all agree one thinking particular issue time convention isnt enough courts wellestablished jurisprudence say core governmental right set aside case cant shown someone convention didnt stand say look affirmatively going say tribes cant sue that way burden works thats point number one point number two opponents effectively conceded oral argument thing effectively conceded briefs 1362 cant pass muster clear statement rule but neither mr aschenbrenner anybody else able come answer obvious point new rule law one constitutional standard one 20year period constitutional standard period would equally precluded result atascadero dellmuth thank it would make completely comparable nevada v hall i give answer though i say i uncertain my reaction would probably california law the honorable court adjourned tomorrow 10 oclock,167.0,250,13,well hear argument next no 891782 david hoffman v native village noatak circle village you may proceed mr lee the spectators admonished court remains session there talking mr lee addressing course sovereign immunity point when petition certiorari filed included third question asking whether federal question jurisdiction whether exists point addressed judge kozinski dissent now brief merits i see that isnt even addressed are giving point is injunctive relief sought and even right eleventh amendment point something left but isnt true isnt certainly true didnt give much emphasis point and i really wonder mr lee i ask question it goes is sovereign immunity bar rely one predated eleventh amendment eleventh amendment because latter course the constitutional convention business would irrelevant yeah the states least high degree dignity speak indian tribes well show yes of course states sue of course one specifically referred constitution the fact states sue monaco mississippi wrongly mr lee think argument entirely consistent holding nevada hall the citizen it seemed arguments would required different result case yeah you mean clear statement rule because congressional statement whatsoever thats right where suit brought federal state court state court state court very well mr lee mr aschenbrenner well hear may i ask one question mr lee since youve got couple minutes left supposing tribe tried sue state alaska state california say able get jurisdiction happened correct and state alaska pleaded sovereign immunity what law would govern plea would california law alaska law federal law right thank mr lee the case submitted,1402.0,1828,12,may please court mr chief justice may please court alaska amicus states tell us tribes permitted sue states directly upset constitutional plan endanger states treasuries violate fundamental principle sovereign states cant sued without consent the states imply may many cases pending court open floodgates direct tribal suits the facts otherwise it 14 years since court decided moe v salish kootenai lower courts immediately construed abrogate states sovereign immunity suit tribes grand total nine tribalstate suits filed and none nine apparently damaging state treasuries single state bothered go back congress seek reversal nor accurately stated permitting direct tribal suits would upset constitutional balance its states came historic sovereign immunity fully intact to contrary already surrendered immunity consented sued united states every indian claim government chooses bring yes your honor yes your honor in short though respect indian claims federal courthouse doors already wide open thus question court whether permitting tribes bring identical suits states already consented sued would upset constitutional balance and submit answer that correct it would upset constitutional balance following reasons first states consented sued direct tribal claims inherently constitutional plan in us v texas south dakota v north carolina court held federal forum peaceful resolution federalstate statestate suits essential peace permanence nation at time constitution adopted threat indian wars far eminent critical wars states recall articles confederation numerous wars occurred federalist papers tell us and numerous lives slaughtered madison tells us recall eve convention georgia invaded creek territory attempted set counties north carolina intruded cherokees choctaws hostile and new york intruded iroquois hostile the historians tell us reason georgia rapidly ratified constitution get federal defense case creeks attacked and thats way constitution adopted if therefore federal forum essential keep peace nation case us state statestate suits far forum necessary keep peace tribalstate disputes i think your honor reason i cite justice stevens dissent oneida v oneida quoted george washingtons speech senecas and george washington recall president constitutional convention lead framer and 1790 1 year constitution adopted gave speech corn planter chief senecas said rights violated indian nonintercourse act either individuals states said federal courts open  but even assuming moment marshall right framers didnt tribes view drafted article iii jurisdictional provision begs question the question court many many questions framers didnt contemplate court nonetheless compelled answer and question framers actually mind whether federal court forum resolve kind controversies essential plan convention so that true your honor following reasoning one could say state versus state federal jurisdiction state versus states disputes essential constitutional plan either took 1892 100 years later first decided one this year laughter the precise question court whether federal court jurisdiction direct tribal suits likewise essential constitutional plan suits united states indian claims and i submit depends whether tribalstate controversies would subject resolution government could bring claims court answered in moe v salish kootenai arizona v san carlos apache court found government infrequently conflict interest precludes suing behalf states otherwise unwilling sue indeed court said one primary purposes adopting 1362 yes yes sir as court said poafpybitty v skelly quote indians right sue depend good judgment zeal government attorney  accordingly tribalstate controversies could resolved unless indians could sue government couldnt wouldnt sue federal jurisdiction direct tribal disputes inherent plan convention this courts case arizona v california supports conclusion federal court jurisdiction strictly limited indian claims brought united states recall case court allowed five indian tribes intervene case government filed objections states eleventh amendment objections states even though indian claims far expansive federal claims now federal court jurisdiction strictly limited party based united states never permitted intervene but justice white court said nonetheless tribes entitled take place independent qualified members body politic accordingly participation litigation critical welfare discouraged admitted all right well get point right your honor thank its true let start preface saying true consents reciprocal the states consented sued tribes submit tribes didnt consent sued state no result history constitution constructed well first place course consented sued united states indian claims benefit ran tribes even though didnt pardon how i submit way consented sued states united states it inherent constitutional plan necessary keep peace but im trying answer answers question im trying get answer states cant sue tribes the tribes states well tribes sue states states consented constitutional plan on hand tribes participants constitutional plan therefore cannot said consented anything further sovereign immunity states tribes developed along different lines the sovereign immunity states justified almost solely ground protecting state treasury sovereign immunity tribes hand based also federal policy embodied numerous laws tribal selfgovernment protect economic selfsufficiency tribes thus congress codified tribes sovereign immunity therefore congress abrogate this courts rationale leading tribal sovereignty case us v fidelity tells us indeed united states holds tribes sovereign immunity trust tribes like holds property trust therefore states cannot sue tribes would suing united states tribes trustee yes sir this statement i relying frequently quoted says quote though immunity tribes sovereigns passed united states benefit tribal properties  thats explanation tribes sue states congress one abrogate tribes immunity put states plan tribes the constitutional plan tribes consented suit states gave congress power rectify imbalance thus far congress realized sovereign immunity important tribes important furthers strong federal policies supporting tribal selfgovernment economic selfsufficiency to extent tribes go bankrupt greater burden placed federal government therefore congress one abrogate tribal sovereign immunity pardon yes well one could one wanted assume resolution tribalstate conflicts time convention dealing time convention wasnt equally important peace nation statestate federalstate controversies it seems history history dictates one answer and indeed states must agreed partially consent suits united states behalf tribal claims in words imbalance states tribes beginning the balance struck way constitution adopted now states also argue government trust responsibility sue behalf tribal claims states entitled rely good judgment government deciding bring tribal claims well i tell first place governments trust responsibility protection tribes states therefore governments entitled rely governments discretion government exercising trust responsibility in states courts i havent thought directly necessary argument say yes your honor i think talking federal courts federal constitutional plan pardon because relying federal structure constitutional plan framers believe yes i think probably could but havent right its inherent constitutional plan well well i havent really addressed mind your honor i shouldnt committed im going go back moment states argument allowed able rely good judgment government determining tribal claims brought the unstated premise argument i submit federal government would less zealous pursuing tribal claims tribes would behalf therefore would greater potential liability state treasury but suggest court construe constitutional scope federal jurisdiction assumption federal government would fully faithfully zealously carry sacred trust responsibility tribes and operating assumption could mean difference states whether sued united states tribes save except limited cases government conflict otherwise unable act well court said i think i think trust responsibility court said arose power dependence tribes from power delegated federal government conjunction dependent status tribes arose duty protect tribes oh far land your honor even case moe v salish kootenai refer i cant quote exactly said something effect duty protect tribal selfgovernment and even cherokee nation case annihilation cherokee government no hands georgia oh certainly your honor no there breach clear breach federal law certainly your honor no i agree no question in short saying direct tribal suits would upset federal constitutional balance states would subjected single indian claim could otherwise claim immunity now states also ask indian commerce clause selfexecuting abrogate sovereign immunity interstate commerce clause isnt its indian commerce clause wipes states immunity suit tribes its structure constitution inherent constitutional plan thats im addressing your honor yes yes thats part thats thing thats inherent in federal constitutional structure thats thing court said us v texas south dakota v north carolina consented sued federal government sister states keep peace therefore inherent constitutional plan all saying tribes situation im sure answer question your honor to finish automatic selfexecuting claim alaska makes argument wed say hand isnt anything constitutional structure dictates private suits states necessary keep peace therefore congress pass law abrogating states sovereign immunity now monaco the state says monaco v mississippi bars tribal suits courts rationale barring suits foreign countries simply doesnt apply governments within constitutional structure suits foreign nations court said could involve international law questions foreign relations whereas tribalstate suits statestate suits could involve international relations states tribes divested foreign relations authority states delegating united states tribes result dependent status in fact hans v louisiana court held federal court jurisdiction statestate disputes quote necessary extinguishment diplomatic relations states the precise rationale applies tribalstate disputes diplomatic relations extinguished constitution they certainly under articles attempted number times succeeded constantly undercut federal government and course even articles yes new york entered treaties with iroquois im sure i cant quote cite all right move onto next point 1362 argument we say even direct tribalstate suits inherent constitutional plan congress abrogated 1362 and 1362 must read construed moe construed construed moe satisfies clear statement rule dellmuth now youll recall moe held tribe could sue state override antiinjunction act held 1362 intended put tribes place government now true moe involved antiinjunction act eleventh amendment by name your honor yes sir its true moe involved antiinjunction act rather eleventh amendment broad jurisdictional barriers purposes identical protect state treasury indeed court called taxing power lifeblood government nonetheless overrode antiinjunction act permitted tribes sue said government could sue but even 1362 construed moe satisfy clear statement rule submit rule simply inapplicable 1362 reason this case distinguishable every clear statement case none court previously construed statute question permit suits states the purpose clear statement rule determine congressional intent court already moe to reinterpret 1362 applying clear statement rule reach different result would anomalous to construe statute one way one defense raised antiinjunction act construe identical statute different way different defense raised eleventh amendment would put meaning act hands defendant rather congress moreover reinterpretation 1362 particularly unjustified congress 14 years reverse courts construction moe hasnt seen fit finally contemporary legal context doctrine court engage presumption congress knows law familiar courts precedents draft legislation conform rules construction court laid in 1966 1362 passed rule construction abrogating tribal sovereign immunity court pardon and rule pardon state statute face broad enough include states states included sovereign immunity waived in short rule pardon almost directly opposite clear statement rule under pardon state must expressly excluded avoid liability whereas clear statement rule states must expressly included held liable in pardon court refused follow justice whites fourjustice dissent demanding clear statement rule and thats way 2 years later 1362 adopted this court hadnt even given yes i your honor i doubled checked this court discussed contemporary legal context doctrine dellmuth implicitly approved rejecting statute question dellmuth passed 1975 whereas 2 years earlier had come employees v public health department foreshadowed clear statement rule therefore justice kennedy court said clear statement rule applied congress aware way in case however rule pardon and court i mean congress couldnt dreamed clear statement rule required court expressly rejected for reason clear statement rule applicable 1362 construed court construed moe finally oh pardon me,337.0,510,30,or claim united states chooses bring it isnt peculiar indian claims you say makes difference plaintiff suits whether united states group indians i dont think really expected creeks choctaws hire lawyer pardon if federal forum essential plan convention didnt prove essential first 200 years i take since really first cases brought court isnt maybe recognize one set 100 years you mean suing behalf indians dont mr aschenbrenner twoway street youre urging i guess tribes sovereign immunity either right thats extraordinary i thought states control come short end stick the tribes sovereign immunity states dont they must stupid people back i dont know happened how states consent sued indian tribes yes the united states yes that doesnt answer question i asked i said doesnt answer question i asked i asked states consented sued indian tribes yes go ahead i thought fidelity fidelity counterclaim case wasnt and also extended tribal sovereign immunity counterclaims is also leading reasoning immunity tribes thats explanation whole thing well congress congress abrogate states eleventh amendment sovereign immunity well cant so leave hands congress either way i suppose do think indian tribe may sue state court states courts states without states consent well federal court different why federal court different i would think would answered least ill ask another question do think congress could constitutionally say state sovereign immunity good suit indian tribe states courts but havent but think without saying word state the states sovereign immunity without congress saying word states sovereign immunity federal courts mr aschenbrenner im surprised answer i thought one three different theories sovereign immunity one state control judicial system cases entertain i would assume state could sovereign immunity cases within state system and i dont know power congress would tell state must entertain actions indian tribes states court system i dont understand basis answer justice white its quite different different sovereign suing federal system arguable nevada hall rationale dont sovereign immunity i dont know say congress abrogate states sovereign immunity governing court system maybe dont dont argue case you think concept united states trustee indian tribes clear constitution something developed practice statute constitution but well fact think well isnt isnt general duty protect tribes its duty to deal faithfully land held tribe well that hands government united states well could indian tribe sue united states say respect land respect anything united states saying youre enough us in order well would federal breach federal law tribe somewhere say alaska said poor losing culture really need lots money restore would cause action united states it something good deal tangible doesnt that argument goes federal courts apparently well i know earlier argument said states waived sovereign immunity just federal courts can united states sue state state court indian claim despite states sovereign immunity did states diplomatic relations tribes constitution you i mean diplomatic relations ordinary sense word occasional other states was moe moe suit state the state montana mr aschenbrenner fingertips

full considered impartial review justification less thorough curtailing part appellants appellate rights court appeals abrogate part appellate responsibility simply law involved state law rather

deference called traditional rule deference this rule circuit applied important rule its important applied diversity cases make 20 25 percent docket federal district courts 15 percent docket court appeals but applies cases well it applies whole variety cases state law serves rule decision one reason another its also important to extent would apply bankruptcy case theres question property rights thats determined state law it would apply wide variety contexts i dont recall seeing particular case relates bankruptcy judges of course one could make argument well i think could make could probably analogize bankruptcy court somewhat administrative agency which least theoretically special expertise narrow area thats true talking state law general we believe rule deference important illconceived in fact really exception historic approach taken court questions law reviewed de novo questions fact reviewed clear error and questions are subject sound discretion district court reviewed abuse discretion i would agree justice oconnor true majority courts appeals applied rule deference however theyve done rule deference started shortly erie case decided 1938 i think first announced eighth circuit theres never court appeals given considered analysis rule deference applied rather citation authority court i would suggest inappropriate since court court limited jurisdiction designed handle cases i think thats correct i think thats rule based i would submit thats sound rationale while true district court judge may heightened familiarity aspects state law i would suggest state law today complex unreasonable assume district judge practitioner meaningful level expertise areas state law would outweigh tremendous advantages i suggest court appeals deciding questions law well course im suggesting deciding necessarily original matter what suggesting is would review decision district court not give particular deference certainly district courts decision ought considered we believe we believe ought no deference district courts decision well tie i would rule i believe question federal law well i suppose tie one one possibility would certify question highest court state could get definitive ruling state law yes the court appeals would defer district court judge sitting court appeals i agree that would make sense i would suggest most district judges of course necessarily practice law jurisdiction i mean district judges came ranks us attorneys most but question that also true furthermore question even practice law area i practiced law rhode island 15 years i feel i certain amount familiarity aspects state law but compared advantages court appeals respect multijudge panel reviewing case parties fully briefing issues district court luxury time extent im suggesting court appeals arent busy but compared district judge accomplish since district judges job primarily conducting trials receiving evidence deciding factual issues well point mentioned earlier certification judge selya explain going let issue go jury made long explanation going ask question certified would propose district judge interrupt trial certify question we ask district judge certify question time in fact question came end case i think would prudent context jury trial time however i think might prudent court appeals certified question rhode island district court i think issue come pretrial well could certified court appeals the way issue came neither parties raised issue substantial performance it came argument motion directed verdict court raised sui sponte suggesting trial judge state court judge period time stated felt intuitive feeling rhode island supreme court might handle issue decided time the parties really much chance research issue thoroughly heat trial frankly court didnt much chance consider issue thoroughly in contrast court appeals full briefing could luxury considering focused legal issue yes that correct and we present district court findings research effect could court anywhere country let alone rhode island applied commercial contract doctrine substantial performance academic relationship student college i dont think mr chief justice it seems take approach weve come full circle erie doctrine back swift v tyson were looking respondent states brief engaged fourthdimensional reasoning transcendent principles truth justice that sounds much like brooding omnipresence general law hanging united states i think essence erie doctrine law determinable state law determinable communicated lawyers judges federal judges less state judges appellate judges less district judges even though appellate judges state that true we rhode island judges appellate i believe connecticut no hes second circuit hes second circuit thats correct in comparison district court main job court appeals deciding law expertly leads conclusion mere fact district court judge may heightened familiarity general state law insignificant compared many institutional advantages court appeals the well im suggesting pay attention district courts opinion but i think difference between paying attention district courts view reviewing district court said theres difference giving deference i think youd give weight would appear deserve context particular case decide advance youre going give particular weight certainly i certainly i think know court commissioner v bosch case said ruling highest court state look wide variety materials you look decisions courts you look i would suggest give special particular weight that special insight that district court judge way state supreme court might rule district court judge put opinion reviewed argued facet case would district court judge special insight matter federal law the court appeals certainly agree well i dont think issue whether reasonable i think court appeals agrees district courts rationale course theyre going affirm well suggesting rule ought de novo review i that would appear case it appear least first circuit defer district court judge were suggesting court appeals review de novo we believe inappropriate well i would suggest justice marshall no i dont think ignore is correct word i think suggesting give special deference district court judge but extent district court judge comes forth rationale makes sense court appeals agrees certainly court appeals going affirm thats right yes and i thats suggesting reasoning thats important judges biography we think i wouldnt treat i would assume that probably i think dangerous practice courts appeals get essentially judge rate going defer judge x great deal experience area going defer judge y less experience maybe thats went bench well i would hope system justice would least strive certain degree intellectual honesty and i dont think rule deference fact used well i dont think thats necessarily giving deference thats sounds court appeals happens agreeing well opinion well thats court appeals engage type analysis well well i hope but i would agree could tell opinion all know opinion deferred district court but i think theres important thing opinion say they dont say judge lagueux judge selya handled case first circuit he handled case summary judgment level he handle trial it judge lagueux there many negative effects contend respect rule deference its vague uncertain it leads therefore uneven appellate review we also believe rule violates erie doctrine extent court appeals superior position accurately predict state law then clearly erie violated deferring district courts decision id like reserve remaining time rebuttal well i suppose that may true i know i know respondent suggests deference simply judicial shorthand court wish write opinion would respectfully suggest thats degree intellectual dishonesty if fact court appeals really reviewing matter de novo using rule deference way avoid writing opinions suggest thats thats proper proper rule yes mr chief justice may please court my brother suggested theres issue constitutional law case i respectfully differ extent erie state rule constitutional law i would suggest cases court interpreting erie fact mandate de novo review in wichita royalty case decided year erie court ruled court appeals substituted state supreme court must therefore interpret law way state supreme court would declared applied i would suggest that implies de novo review required furthermore palmer v hoffman court cases court ruled state law presumptions burdens proof control diversity case i suggest logical presumptions burdens proof apply trial level equally apply appellate level and hanna v plumer court ruled unfair erie character result materially differ suit brought federal court i would suggest rule deference least character result case differ case brought federal court unless court questions the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,500.0,853,40,well hear argument no 891629 salve regina college v sharon russell mr snow well court say view would absent deference did say werent werent giving deference heres think law means do think theres would making argument done thing do think court appeals bound independently interpret state statutes in diversity cases mr snow i think assume court familiar factual background case procedural background case does apply bankruptcy cases know is authority deference given bankruptcy judges practiced jurisdiction reported cases referring district judges i take principle would well practical matter dont think circuits years pretty much gone along interpretation state law given district judge often state perhaps familiar state law i think uhhuh well think common sense sort feeling district court judge may familiar state law circuit court judges generally may may come state well would suggest complexity state law today court appeals first circuit four states court appeals like ninth circuit maybe 10 11 states try decide original matter questions 11 12 states ought treated differently district courts decision point federal law no deference well tie well go do decide flip coin or get deferred district judge do certification procedure state rhode island mr snow i sat court appeals decade i remember court judge outside circuit sitting designation yet court appeals would defer matter state law place sitting designation it doesnt make sense no sitting designation trial judge state come i ask opponents thats theory soil gives expertise just spot laughter of course thats exactly typical case even most district judges residenced sit arent yeah well practiced law practiced law jurisdiction sit there judges illinois district courts didnt practice fact none didnt practice illinois indiana wisconsin i dont know circuit didnt practice district sat but number ninth circuit practice exclusively criminal area civil area isnt true if thought time think would prudent interrupt trial take time certify rhode island supreme court so district judge kind axed peril amounts i guess but raise day made ruling didnt he raised announced next day yes dont dont think reasonable mr snow for court appeals say judge sitting rhode island practiced rhode island may well feel rhode island supreme court would cant judges never practiced cant get reading decisions court even though appellate judges state question this true panel isnt judge timbers new york may i ask question do say court appeals give weight district judges absolutely de novo say totally unresolved question i one i circuit judge theres absolutely law point illinois supreme court decide should pay attention district courts view well obviously know well review you read much read everything find say well neither illinois supreme court appellate court illinois trial judge i find ruled precise issue law one way we must decide district judge said well i hunch i think probably theyd go way should i give weight i go ahead flip coin would give much deference would law general article written professor law school state studying thing 20 years well say say courts intermediate courts appeals state split subject matter its never gotten state supreme court law professors debate judge district judge decide decide supreme court state going should give weight but say read court appeals reads law professors articles read opinions the courts appeals split read district judge can say well position seems like reasonable one thats end cant say yeah dont agree well say agree enough say sounds reasonable hes saying sounds reasonable theres rule required district judge member state courts bar so district judge practicing lawyer state district judge next practiced law california would different rule well want should ignore man practiced law i use word ignore do buy do buy word to make sense big part i mean comparing law review article written somebody is know law review articles dont generally say i think law im i mean usually give reasons right evaluate author say basis reason gives the harvard law review doesnt say supreme court clearly erroneous accept judgment maybe laughter what would district judge practiced state conducted bar exam refresher course bar 20 years wouldnt assume knew little bit especially contracts but thats gone centuries you know in terms spoken opinions know talk court queens bench 19th century appeal judge keckquick theres still reasons reversal laughter so goes whether spoken i i interrupt what intellectually dishonest court appeals saying judge selya says hes looked substantial performance cases he thinks theyd apply area like others restatement applies thats weve got go well accept whats intellectually dishonest well thats happened im talking opinion judge selya said i looked ive looked substantial performance cases i find i found two they construction cases one construction case one something else ive read restatement i think hunch rhode island court would apply law now theres nothing intellectually dishonest if anything hes overtly candid they said view rule deference well well follow say they nothing apparently didnt call rhode island law attention didnt oh but didnt did mention fact might copout courts appeals its easy way defer we dont bother case get next one careful counsel cause several us done know laughter thank mr snow mr hogan well hear thank mr snow the case submitted,1219.0,1915,24,mr chief justice may please court in answer mr justice blackmun make clear respondent disassociates completely thought intellectual honesty among circuit court judges i contrary i think circuit court judges fact give de novo reviews every issue comes conscientiously exert entire intellectual process problems make resolution one way another circuit district judge either right wrong and hes right isnt point wasting time writing longwinded opinion simply gild lily if hes wrong golly well reverse thats and sometimes write longwinded opinion in many instances mr justice scalia they simply say affirm basis trial trial judges district judges determination opinion given in particular case trial judges determination bench decision heat trial didnt long exposition might take place day two consider would say bench but dealing kind constitutional issues were dealing appellate court reviews decisions cases precedential value case court this diversity case and diversity cases set precedent whatsoever next day state supreme court rule contrary matter erudite deep thought well thought circuit court opinion may the fact next day said judge brown fifth circuit back 1963 said last word speaking circuit court opinions diversity cases he says thats latest slug drops st louis linotype writing texas court may melt lead much drops such perils diversitys jurisdiction now thats exactly dealing only no totally different question that true extent federal issue course opportunity review overrule circuit court appeals decision involved federal question on hand deal diversity cases lower court make prediction hes dealing vacuum way theres determination state supreme court rule he therefore sort divine guess best supreme court would later date now prediction really nothing guess best estimate would happen there nothing says three circuit judges sitting quietude chambers make best better guesstimers not really district judge circuit court judges overruled next day state supreme court and circuits sit within number jurisdictions four circuit many eight ten circuits why federal court there several reasons first your honor met diversity citizenship test time fact matter trial calendar federal court providence rapidly reached trial state supreme court superior court superior court state court crowded calendar 4 5 years trial fortunately federal district judges providence able get cases within 12 18 months that one really compelling reasons brought case first instance it languished long time judge selya matter district judge reserved decision motion summary judgment took period time decision came come decision said would hold case try could get circuit court long enough hear district court level and year half went tried ultimately excuse and thats ultimately tried different judge so delay actual trial case one occurred federal judge trying accommodate calendar situation but cases set absolutely precedent seems turn around say judges circuit courts already overburdened trying find time write opinions cases set precedent agree district judge right interpretation guess state supreme court would require set write long opinions proving 2 2 4 reinventing wheel seems youre putting wholly burden wholly unnecessary burden upon courts well thats different problem if fact determine district judge wrong i havent yet seen circuit court say well think hes wrong going reverse dont want take time write opinion i seen many cases said would normally give great deference great weight expressions articulations deference rule but particular case firm conviction error things say proceed reverse district court im sure i understand your position i dont subscribe concept circuit court say tough case well duck thats youre saying words i think obligation upon circuit court review every case comes give every issue thats raised parties fair hearing now fair meaningful issue doesnt necessarily mean ipso facto give de novo opinion im certain privy happens circuit court judges chambers i suspicion circuit judges take cases advisement confer among they confer clerks et cetera arrive sort decision take account arguments presented they read cases read consider things come conclusion district judge thoroughly wrong so write opinion shows hes wrong well or could prove effect think district court right we dont go longwinded discussion we simply use judicial shorthand deference rule we dont think hes unreasonable we think interpretation fair one i method shorthand thats i called brief it way court frankly avoid waste time comes writing opinions nothing gild lily opinions mean nothing supreme court state thinks contrary within matter hours you mr justice kennedy and reason i think thats clearly that possible situation some law writers indicate true im aware that happen but hand i thats part growing aspect law i think call living tree law consequently yes could happen given vote jurisdiction district different determinations issue different judges and might deferred that happen i cant deny im trying say doesnt happen by circuit court precisely because well well i could conceive issue comes second time around lets say deferred district court judge first time around given fashion case lets say district judge correct then issue comes second time around conclude well golly maybe werent right first time then could sit write opinion say wrong theyve done there cases books say well second thought second reflection think contrary but instances happen rare indeed question exception trying prove rule i think fact virtually cases deal situation circuit courts fact perform duty thats encumbered upon circuit courts give parties fair meaningful review legal issues involved and im say circuit courts dont to contrary i believe and i dont think required order give litigant fair opportunity legal position heard required write long opinions every time issue comes you know well course let let let answer fashion mr justice white first i think amicus brief clear 1 2 percent cases heard first circuit deal diversity citizenship cases state rhode island you realize rhode island rather small territory no i dont i dont feel way and i dont feel lawyers rhode island feel way i think aware longstanding rule time ive ever practiced circuit courts would give substantial great weight deference articulations deference rule district court determination state law im process one heard next tuesday i hope succeed i dont know whether i well find i think boils really question issue de novo review required type case certainly required constitutional provision its even required statute rule court so becomes matter whether matter sound administration justice deferential rule makes sense particular cases the deferential rule well deference rule doesnt require absolute deference i i dont know case ive come upon says deferential rule i refer whats sir no sir no no isnt i think misunderstand position my position i court write opinion sake writing opinions my position simple when circuit court reviews fairly completely issue court concludes trial judge correct interpretation issue reasonable errorprone either either mr either i think appropriate i i believe i i arrive conclusion trial justice error position reasonable ever want say that prepared overturn reverse circumstances apply i call deferential rule and defer unless conclude thoroughly wrong error if find error hesitate write opinions ive brief cites numerous cases effect various circuits overturned district court decisions although giving voice deferential rule so isnt question deference therefore conclusively presumed not this question conclusive deference bound mr justice white ninth circuit came opinion matter mclinn back 1984 i think fair say every circuit court appeals throughout country position would said well think matter first impression us would rule differently district judge we dont think hes wrong we dont think unreasonable we substitute judgment we defer affirm well not quite area federal jurisdiction issues little bit different happen federal case little different happens diversity case state law issues involved i federal cases federal courts require degree expertise state courts obviously dont get contrary i think certain state courts acquire better expertise state law perhaps federal courts deal different issues when district court required find diversity case state law hes pretty much unless determination already ahead if hes bound but absence definitive ruling state supreme court divine thinks he overruled trial judge state court that isnt quite true federal court deciding regulatory agencies interpretations theres nobody overrule i mean except circuit court on diversity case yes ninth circuit came mclinn case back 1984 sharply divided court i think 6 5 held first time i could i case said flatly henceforth circuit issues state law decided de novo plenary basis court i first time i found case espouses rule flatly broadly its mc mclinn its 739 fed 2nd 1395 i tell i case really gives rise whole issue first time circuit courts decide circuit court decided state law issues would resolved de novo basis deference whatsoever district court judges ruling that threw whole ball wax grabs going right rule apply and i practically every circuit exception i think third conceivably might language sixth circuit would construed de novo type ruling cited amicus case im circuits however continued apply deferential rule there cases cited brief various circuits i think first second fifth sixth seventh eighth tenth postdate mclinn case apply deferential rule even face ninth circuits decision mclinn said everything de novo i certainly because hes hes good position frankly opinion make guess rhode island supreme court three judges circuit court boston one comes puerto rico one new hampshire one maine if five judges supreme court tomorrow say three wrong this totally different situation were dealing federal law theres hierarchy follow neatly way august bench we dealing situation anywhere along line whole thing shortcircuited state supreme court ruling even followed trial judges rhode island well wed wed still waiting trial so i really think boils question whether trial judge better position make determination circuit court and law writers say one telling points tried made circuit court ninth circuit mclinn case failing give type fullblown fullscale legal review unsettled law questions would advocation authority position unfair litigants judge schroeder dissent makes clear point refutation position one better comments ive read whole issue comes judge amentalot eighth circuit case arthur young reeves i think reversed court recently name reeves ernst young i do sir i dont think give deference you given deference i dont think youre required give deference you past said defer the case hori japanese emigrant case judge powell footnote decision referred fact court given deference different district court judges determinations state law issues in bernhardt i i answered question i think i i i say give deference well well wouldnt make happy particular case thats youre asking laughter i think power say legal right say would right depends say well applying case i problem ill accept first circuit rule happy litigator advocate result would please greatly simply say let diversity opinion circuits dont care let first circuit stand ill glad accept whether thats good example administration justice i leave your honors i wont dispute either if thats comfortable court dichotomy among circuits comfortable right position but matter administration i dont know whether thats good bad indifferent that would strike good whats sir yes well applied applied applied rule deference yes applied rule deference the second circuit still adheres rule deference id still well sat first circuit designation he wrote opinion and probably dissented just circuit court judge charged knowing within first circuit law rhode island hes maine if hes going sit circuit i i would think hed in event seems i said earlier i comes matter plain common sense judge arnold said he said know one look law books print still degree reliable judgment legal questions lawyer lived practiced years jurisdiction there thing dean pound called law action opposed law books each state distinct legal ethos informs qualifies lawyers judges understand written law books so defer opinions district courts law state shirking responsibilities we simply using common sense i think concludes arguments,423.0,697,47,and sometimes write longwinded opinion why cant thats theyre dont say affirm reasons stated district judge rather affirm district judge thinks thats right answer i mean know those two quite different formulations i suppose could say thing federal questions court appeals knows go labor next day supreme court united states may may make dead letter right well distinction its us versus texas supreme court i mean point it doesnt court appeals opinion forever theres somebody overturn i mean worth why bring case federal court well why 2 2 make 5 well dont make rule dont write opinion matters state law instead making rule dont consider i mean know if timesaving thing wouldnt wouldnt better rule make well point i assume appellate court supposed review the issues law are case youre saying one issue law timeconsuming dont review issue law they say well know district judge knows seems reasonable may wrong so youre youre advocating keep deference rule doesnt really mean anything what what rule one district single state california four different districts do give deference district judge even though district judges may come contrary conclusions state law so ninth circuit affirms one case case reverses case even though issue law identical district judge reached different conclusion by court court right both deferred court and yet say saving problem writing opinion even though come different ways cases i mean surely must something saving trouble writing opinion thoroughly adequately considered matter i mean cant ways either think theyre really examining matter word deference really doesnt mean anything think mean something case reach different results way i take state court appeals diversity cases must defer much district judges lawyers think theres use appealing district judges ruling i mean if there much deference district judge youd wasting money appealing legal question i take thats case circuit well i know but dont need look universal district whole circuit how lawyers practicing rhode island do feel useless appeal question law court appeals but think despite maybe weak weak strong presumption think could justify spending clients money appealing a question law circuit court exactly yes is appeal sense word use word appeal give absolute deference crowd well people say havent arguing youve standing havent arguing case means theres way win i thought thats saying you said write opinion i sure well which correct reasonable which two you reasonable wrong these justice marshalls questions i think well why dont return justice marshalls question well what what court appeals panel sits agree that if deciding first instance would think laws state statute construed manner construction district judge given also reasonable construction but would prefer others original matter think well think take view district judge now is proper court appeals so thats sort like deferring federal court deferring administrative agencys view statute well you say certain point the even court appeals thought better view statute district judges view within realm reasonableness would defer on diversity case now say certain point ninth circuit decided what citation ill look ill look brief let ask question i asked mr snow suppose every federal district judge rhode island disqualified wasnt graduated college something judge duffy southern district new york assigned sit trial judge do think court appeals first circuit defer interpretation rhode island law why well well one excuse three judges one southern district new york yes would nice state court got definitive ruling right away on hand answer good one calendars clogged do give deference trial court yes sir i said give deference trial court did say do do say would right say due deference trial court think wrong would good enough mr hogan there one rule among circuits rule circuit court shouldnt automatically rubber stamp district judge says why shouldnt one circuit able to give give normal deference would say and ninth circuit follow rule uh the first circuit the first circuit may know district judges the ninth circuit may know judges another circuit judge timbers first circuit so youd say that applies deference to first circuit he sat wrote opinion and ninth circuit would charged knowing law hawaii law huh would no is charged

maritime worker received lhwca longshore harbor workers compensation act benefits pursuant award administrative law judge thereafter seek seamans remedies whether person precluded the second issue whether injured maritime workers status seaman dependent upon job assignment time injured dependent upon prior work history employers employer the case could decided either one two questions favor could end case i think case yes reason significant clear split circuits issues i think would decision made issues i think it would eliminate problems raised brief duplicative litigation case issue would resolve split circuits issue the case could decided narrow grounds i dont think decided narrow grounds i well actually somewhat different fields i think people purely deep water seaman issues second issue would important to involved administration lhwca paying benefits lhwca first issue important i think theyre equally important different segments industry extent group overlaps i think important resolve issues the preclusion issue first issue involving benefits longshore harbor workers compensation act i wanted underscore difference case gizoni case argued strenuously side in gizoni case worker injured received sort compensation order whether administrative law judge section 8i settlement district director he simply receiving benefits essentially voluntarily time seeking seaman status the difference case one case compensation order triggers section 905a talks of longshore harbor workers compensation act talks employers liability exclusive act issue makes employer liable in case lhwca compensation order whether settlement administrative law judges case in case well employer would always get protection voluntarily paid thats true on hand employers point view they feel jones act suit inappropriate status needs determined would object worker seeking seaman status department labor forum point get adjudication status sooner later adjudication status it may employer yes the section refer yes talked case theres lhwca finding status jones act case reverse construe pursuant jones act state workers compensation as opposed to voluntary payment jones act settlement payments state workers compensation i think would strained reading take 903e doesnt say anything exclusive liability employer adjudicated to pay lhwca say 903e retracted immunity without statement 903e intending retract immunity without legislative history but saying well gizoni adjudication yet individuals status therefore section 905a never came play yes well really control injured worker because right decide forum almost he actually district court judge try status first went status well wasnt appeal the case concluded still 905b action it interlocutory decision the trial 905b action taken place take place alj made decision thats really entirely accurate either im sorry under longshore act claimant doesnt actually file something its employers obligation file injury reported case the employer voluntarily paying receiving longshore benefits pursued jones act litigation status finding first i dont mean quibble word invoked the employer obligation make payments without he chose status decided first district court jones act case actually yes yes yes he wanted seaman status determined district court im sorry i didnt hear no he could waited he could pursued appeal yes thats right yes as soon 905b trial could appealed findings trial status thats true could found he position seaman claims hes seaman that well employer ceased payments could said i entitled payments sought adjudication if employer controverts duty pay obligated yes pay pending adjudication there penalties wrong yes could period worker receiving longshore benefits fact seaman puts position seamen tort victims i believe would i think know question necessarily case i think matter logic would because interlocutory ruling first final ruling status one govern technically latter issue seaman longshore worker aljs time time say find longshore worker seaman where youre neither yes definitely well could inland somebody maritime worker theres long involved situs status determination right exactly those three categories there hundreds hundreds cases every year seamans status debated this isnt even outside record it quoted petition certiorari there many many cases status issue difficult issue litigated case allowed stand litigated twice correct and question im sure day court address namely court said repeatedly two acts mutually exclusive somebody gets award jones act instance first mutually exclusive longshore act in case case first action longshore act statute says employers liability exclusive law admiralty i dont know could mean theres jones act remedy allowed follow that may right right yes the that possibility two pending proceedings one tribunal would stay action pending resolution and states including california cases filed state court jones act cases rules say action gets precedence first the first filed action often gets precedence some states dont rule district court would make discretionary decision whether await aljs finding make finding case alj would bound at tribunals courts alj case hardship procedural tools make early status decision the claimant go whichever tribunal wants decide issue say hardship case i need quick decision that issue severed simply status question liability merits its often oneday proceeding get early status decision but course receiving case compensation benefits throughout district judge right actually amount would obtained the back second injury back injury final total permanent disability interim benefits his interim benefits would so receive benefits throughout its part package injured worker longshore harbor workers compensation act he oh yes go forward it went forward district court trial yes and trial issue right he negligence action pursued conclusion the id happy answer question all right issue if yes if longterm assignment yes seamans job yes fact something ships tied dock no really it really different job assignment different job assignment could assigned one time ship voyage its status individual first individual never precedent judged current assignment whether one vessels single employer reason would make every worker seaman past potentially seaman the court indeed indeed i the chandris case i think beautiful example illustrating seaman transferred office its hired union hiring hall makes difference that makes difference its work employers clearly job changed his job assignment changed changes employers works different vessels he new job because need status seaman seaman remedy im sure im following question yes the seamans remedies allowed people seaman status not would its relationship always considered determinative status given employee always considered current job assignment governs case because would seaman remedies cover seamen former seamen seamen seamen remedies limited people subject perils sea i dont think unless part continuing employment yes if if longterm employment look entirety longterm employment they pick workers hiring hall voyage basis specific timelimited basis it could 1 day could week particular tug yes although job may 1 day yes,1084.0,1374,58,well hear argument number 951621 harbor tug  barge company v john papai mr danoff mr danoff preliminary question court address second question conclude look prior relationship tug owner employers confine fleet principle owner vessels worked we reach first question would become advisory i mean would happen decide second issue favor and end case i mean business offering alternative holdings well theres split answering might make something advisory seems which two important issue field mr danoff would explain i know literal interpretation 905a standing back mentioned gizoni case that says employer pays voluntarily longshore act would amenable later jones act case on hand employer says penny drag forum go workers compensation longshore mold fastest case would say cant jones act case employer much solicitous employee could what sense would make yes know big problem i see provision title 33 section 903e now i guess thats longshoreman harbor workers act and says notwithstanding provision law amounts paid employee injury disability death benefits claimed chapter longshoreman workers case pursuant jones act seaman act case shall credited liability imposed chapter now court expressed reliance section gizoni presumably section give effect i dont know would apply proposed rule what would purpose section well i dont know reverse it says amounts paid employee injury uhhuh so would confine section voluntary payment benefits what courts reliance section gizoni well think whatever remedy first obtained final court judgment one governs is race courthouse judgment kind thing yes how say based here injured worker presumably went longshoreman harbor workers administrative judge asserted fact longshoreman harbor workers worker wanted benefits got order appealed it become final but interim injured worker also went court jones act said contrary claim longshoreman administrative proceeding fact seaman entitled recover is situation it appeal though but say workers choice worker chose jones act route district judge said im sorry dont fit jones act went workers compensation tribunal well claim file first did file first district court first longshore yes pursue pursue benefits order didnt first pursue jones act remedy and he invoke longshore harbor workers act district court ruled jones act case you said employees choice route wants go case employee chose jones act first and stuck wasnt final judgment he couldnt appeal asked adjudication longshore workers isnt history case and thats debatable first choice district court well could remained first choice couldnt why could remained first choice is compulsion come back harbor workers act ask adjudication he could pursued appeal without pressing harbor workers claim within power maintain first choice he couldnt appeal he tried get 1292b turned court appeals right so stuck long time he could ultimately appealed though decision adverse district court in meantime live yes could found position pending appeal jones act case employer ceased voluntary payments hedge reasonable hedge bringing harbor workers claim he but wouldnt gotten anything administrative adjudication final in words i assume theres provision mere filing claim harbor workers act obligates employer start making payments pending ultimate adjudication liability if gone way alj suppose alj said i find persons sailor would issue preclusive district court litigation even though scenario went district court first district court said youre sailor goes longshore route gets determination sailor doesnt contest comes back district court says see ive got final adjudication im entitled longshore benefits im sailor say district court despite district courts earlier ruling would would issue preclusive do administrative law judges routinely say sailor say are longshore worker well could instances could correct im wrong youre neither all right so what what i wasnt aware well like im neither one right i could bring lawsuit found neither one laughter it possible so mean somebody might state workers compensation i the big problem comes people may sailors may longshore workers how big problem i didnt sense but mr danoff i understood say moment ago exact issue administrative proceeding whether one longshore worker say know practical matter everybody agrees two choices adjudication frequently made form saying youre sailor issue technically arises act longshore worker longshore worker okay if thing court technically empowered decide issue statute preclusive effect court goes step says youre longshore worker way sailor why frolic preclusive well i guess court addressed question sense said acts intended one yes could yes means cant also consistent it could neither neither exactly usual rules preclusion i think operate respect necessary judgment first action determination seaman explained us necessary judgment first action therefore normal preclusion rules i suppose would raise estoppel well justice souter contiadicting hes saying youre never going assurance one determination either longshoreman act district court sure found first action either seaman longshore worker one precluded case first action found harbor worker seaman youre still going second action it doesnt affect case once youre found harbor worker but adjudication person fact yes longshoreman i understand if prevail adopt rule issue preclusion finding agency longshore status would district court jones act suit correct acting within discretion defer proceedings administrative hearings concluded the district court would say possibility issue resolved conclusively favor longshore status ill wait i believe said provisional remedies employee situation this employees dilemma i want jones act i think i prove negligence i want pain suffering i certainly want something employer cooperative what someone whos dilemma thinks hes got good jones act claim needs interim maintenance but problem thats essentially happened immediate appeal also claim employer shipowner only knee not injury right didnt and i guess theres even third cause action employee owner vessel thats affected discussion but agree go forward and going forward right may i ask i dont want i want ask question issue finished is good time if joe smith carpenter boat tied dock hurts hes 10 trips boat ship sailor hes sailor right he happened hammering nails forth hes worked however employer 10 trips 11th one i take wed call sailor cases even though thing changed happens hurt painting and fact situation except earlier trips different ships owned person same result what im really trying get ill frank fact person sailor worked 10 times different ships company sailing capacity make difference 10 previous trips different companies hired union hiring hall well i guess addressed closest case might chandris where court acknowledged respect employer fleet doctrine could applicable situation employees job changed in fact dealing employee hired seaman go voyages chief engineer communications expert something work capacity did court acknowledge assignment could change and assignment indeed changed worker going asked come board paint vessel tied dock repairs daily basis would change assignment even employer much less different one what im driving yes fact many variables hold constant hes seaman fleet doctrine suddenly make difference everything else isnt employers fleet union hiring hall thats im trying get does simple fact everything else would make seaman fact hes hired union hiring hall works ships different employers past thats difference make legal difference why make legal difference then speak terms status rather terms continuing employment relationship seaman given fleet employer why help talk status view status apparently something reference reference except respect relationship employer given employee given employer well thats right thats weve said but make sense talk terms status why make sense congress make sense us really concerned duration repetition relationship worker particular employer well hasnt court said determined basis status employee havent made rule statutes havent interpreted statutes making rule and someone hired temporarily go paint tug dock ever going seaman virtue employ matter many days goes paints but fact acting question whether given case acting seaman appropriate look prior kinds jobs look prior kinds jobs given employer rather prior kinds jobs like employers concern status rather details employment relationship given employer given employee but make difference status issue then look carry logic extreme ever look prior job assignment well i thought purposes determining substantiality satisfaction two criteria seamen status well i suppose did person hired generally like engineer whatever vessel sea employer one time vessel parked harbor employer said way go paint deck looked overall job employer i assume determine whether seaman whether moment is longterm employment setup the solicitor general said operation permanent crews like vessel goes crew longterm relationship tell fact is true tug permanent crew even sea pickup workers hiring hall so employees picked hiring hall perjob perjob basis thank mr danoff mr boyle well hear you,753.0,1018,11,mr chief justice may please court as stated previously court already held voluntary payment longshore benefits preclude jones act award neither neither formal award made case preclude jones act suit before i get though one thing i make clear scenario never occurs except one very specific instance thats employer owns ship the employer must ship problem and motion summary judgment made jones act complaint defendant also petitioner also made motion summary judgment plaintiff 905b action negligence judge decided jones act case judge also decided 905b case thereby deciding man longshoreman judge district judge decided man longshore act ever went alj well your honor district judge determined circumstance mans employment could proceed 905b action a partial partial denial motion summary judgment right no but your honor order even maintain 905b action one longshoreman one may seaman because longshore act provides lien 905b action already determined district court it determined alj the alj mistakenly redetermined the district judge already determined you mean arguably longshoreman well i think court case dismissable defendant petitioner argued man 905b action along jones act cause action judge decided view circumstances longshoreman within longshore act your honor determination finder fact 905b action whether worker longshoreman given longshoreman no finder fact decides longshore status 905b case yes your honor well like nature diversity action allege youre citizen state a allege defendant citizen state b yes defendant controvert case they said yes your honor and part 905b case went alj department labor get lien established thats went department labor get benefits get lien established it part 905b process it ticket punched 905b action because alj didnt recognize already precluded making another determination status virtue district judges decision undertook make new determination made new determination made yes mr chief justice the reason i got lot colloquy mr danoffs argument people seamen longshoreman neither thats reason i brought thats yes well well way works employer went front alj vigorously argued worker seaman regardless alj decided arguments conduct advanced litigant front alj principles equitable estoppel would prevent employer going front district judge taking opposite position well case cases never employee go vigorously argue theyre longshoreman well extent one guidelines astoria savings case versus solimino incentive vigorously aggressively pursue position now five things alj determination alj awards longshore benefits indicate entitled administrative collateral estoppel first mentioned mr danoffs argument statute longshore statute 903e talks credit jones act payments making longshore awards if goes direction one way go direction also the second one 913c well courts opinion gizoni 502 us page 91 court stated one reasons receipt longshore benefits preclude pursuit jones act benefits section 903e longshore act says payments reason payments made jones act would credit liability imposed upon employer longshore act footnote opinion mentioned detrimental reliance upon position employee takes employer gets credit paid moneys jones act that situation opposite also true true employer gets credit moneys paid longshore act pursuit jones act remedy its one parts statute indicates coexistence longshore act jones act one there four others the second one it could trying determine whether congress enacted various iterations longshore act meant alj award preclusive this one five circumstances act indicates didnt mean no its preclusive either one well longshore benefits paid voluntarily employers jones act benefits paid voluntarily employers you file suit jones act you take position youre jones act seaman if take position youre jones act seaman youre entitled trial jury present prima facie case youre jones act seaman i believe thats plaintiff judge got factual circumstances beyond prima facie case granted summary judgment thats right thats choice litigant takes definitely hes injured board vessel situs injury would entitle state comp circumstances i want get nothing maintenance cure nothing unseaworthy it yes yes long hes temporarily disabled as soon becomes permanently disabled gets nothing it nothing isnt 22 day because thats tort remedy thats part seamans tort unseaworthiness negligence you prove case unseaworthiness yes unseaworthiness absolute liability like products liability oh yes oh yes cause action unseaworthiness thats also proving case just lesser standard unless cant prove negligence chances somewhat unlikely well usually goes way around its easier prove unseaworthiness prove negligence negligence get causation matter slight prove negligence causal connection accident injury lot lot thinner negligence i think thats correct thats true absolutely thats correct well thats true gizoni anyway thats already established employer paying compensation cut jones act case what talking employer employee obtaining formal award whether formal award entitled administrative collateral estoppel yes the second one 913d longshore act statute limitations filing claim jones act tolled employee pursues jones act time hes found seaman court hes relegated longshore act but point statute limitations tolled the third one 922 longshore act formal award modified within year making makes different formal awards adjudications aljs third reason i believe i dont think ever happened theoretically yes because language statute says aspect order entered deputy commissioner modified 1 year means the fourth reason purpose longshore act if mentioned justice ginsburg mr danoffs argument make formal award preclusive remove incentive employer make voluntary payment court already ruled making voluntary payments preclusive if make formal award preclusive thats contrary purpose longshore act foster prompt payment compensation medical benefits injured workers well this isnt well problem back 1920 workers compensation laws back 1927 1920 jones act enacted designed give itinerant seamen cause action tried jury employer but congress decided seamen would covered state workers comp well federal workers compensation law 1920 i getting purpose jones act fifth reason afford seamen trial jury crew members really seamen trial jury issue negligence status and trial jury prima facie case established i believe case chandris v latsis worker contributed function mission vessel connection vessel substantial duration nature goes jury jury considers things like perils sea jury considers whether ate slept lived vessel a jury considers whether daybyday assignment but prima facie case made jury consider circumstances an alj equipped now theres four things particular alj determination makes nonpreclusive second one laches defendant petitioner believing sharp governed case believing would preclusive bring attention district judge waited got court appeals thats laches that prevents preclusion and fourth one court decides follow sharp change law back 197 1992,443.0,678,25,thats simply denial summary judgment thats determination fact district court what order district court enter denial motion summary judgment on 905b that simply means theres enough evidence go trial it doesnt mean district court making factual finding one way in fact district courts dont make factual findings summary judgment excuse would district judge find surely seaman probably valid cause action 905b determine least arguably seaman arguably cause action arguably longshoreman arguably he arguably 905 didnt say 905b arguably means hes arguably longshoreman is right what mean given who gives who gives and cant controverted mr boyle im following argument well never got 905b case district case first threw jones act case the district judge say youre sailor and said youre sailor thats although interlocutory case went 905b case then get adjudication benefits alj i dont follow are getting alternative basis affirmance ninth circuit the ninth circuit said question us whether plaintiffs receipt compensation benefits lhwca precludes also recovering seaman jones took given that happened dont go thing youre talking we ordinarily take ninth circuits findings receive can i ask main collateral estoppel issue something thats bothering i dont see answered maybe theres obvious answer but opinion injured employee goes longshoreman people first say youre longshoreman person able sue jones act say im seaman doesnt bind right okay what happens opinion first happens wants employer bound similarly bound similarly in words happens say first proceeding youre longshoreman youre seaman injured person goes court employer says oh youre seaman youre longshoreman man ends nothing because court says hes longshoreman alj said hes seaman penny so supposed work possible employer would bound employee wouldnt that doesnt seem fair how whole thing work well wouldnt equally bind employee will measure vigor argument determining collateral estoppel excuse i dont understand of course could opponent says that could handle situation jones act determination without collateral estoppel effect situation jones act damages partly different entirely different harbor worker damages your view preclusive employer wins preclusive employee wins so going deal worker preclusive either case you either one hand give system law worst would happen worker sometimes would get quite much money take system sometimes workers get credit sometimes theyll get nothing i admit that last possibility seems real one system something i find difficult square i think congress mind but isnt also true throw situations plaintiff recover neither scheme fact seaman cant recover longshoreman may able prove negligence event wont recover jones act either well hes neither maybe hes entitled state workers comp just one point if hes seaman theres negligence still gets something vessel unseaworthy or maintenance cure but get seaman thats 22 week what claim vessels unseaworthy and it nothing in words thats comprised within jones act claim negligence thats im asking why doesnt justice stevens put case isnt possible seaman theres negligence so i say dont still cause action unseaworthiness say nothing all right but doesnt mean gets nothing cause action unseaworthiness well cant prove either unseaworthiness negligence perhaps doesnt deserve get anything but thats nothing longshore workers compensation fault unseaworthiness still form liability you prove ship unseaworthy state its i injured knee i collect so usual tradeoff isnt show employer pays workers compensation risk tort suit and yet youre saying thats works the employer subject compensation award say flows doesnt follow that employer despite paid compensation still risk negligence action and said five reasons cannot and youve told us one im curious hear four can modified respect determination longshoreman status what makes believe never happened but wouldnt entirely accord whole purpose schemes longshore act also state workmans compensation schemes they intended give employee assurance promptness expense maybe waiving greater damages could gotten thats thats schemes set thats deal you get fast get sure exchange youre giving shot tort remedies might get lot bucks now fact happen minicontext procedural dilemma doesnt trouble much thats part big deal well well certainly lots workmans compensation laws 1920 state workers compensation well may one thing i thought said werent workmans compensation laws 1920 that simply factually inaccurate thank mr boyle mr frederick well hear you,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,341.0,528,23,thank mr chief justice may please court in gizoni court recognized unique interplay longshore act jones act in case court said longshore act clearly comprehend preclusive effect  specifically provides amounts paid employee injury jones act shall credited liability imposed  longshore act the hardship question the in longshore act proceeding finding would binding whether why jones act would binding longshore act different question no would yes justice breyer answer question governments position alj determination longshore award binding preclusive effect subsequent jones act suit brought employee there for whether if what the answer question congress intend administrative estoppel apply our position congress it thats correct now second part answer question would principles equitable estoppel apply thats different issue whether employer suffered detrimental reliance court said footnote 5 no theres difference collateral estoppel thank thank yes i the result let answer question hardship if alj decides worker member crew district court decides person member crew remedy 922 calls modification awards in instance person go back longshore proceeding say i unfairly rejected longshore benefits i would like he within year apply if within year files notice department labor says if oh yes justice i would like justice scalia answer file seek stay it would prolong period limitations yes thats correct okay but justice scalia justice scalia district court action proceeding file notice labor department say i action proceeding district court please dont make 1year period toll thats hes got to keep open modification award the district director thats correct thats correct courts decisions his rights file modification award thats clear and thats also clear justice scalia congress intend alj proceedings preclusive effect subsequent jones act suits its yes likely that case always reason would applying principles judicial collateral estoppel rather administrative collateral estoppel in likely scenario district court proceeding jones act preclusive effect principles judicial collateral estoppel apply thats correct thats correct justice ginsburg right there two principles two provisions would point crediting provision makes clear congress anticipated parallel proceedings would occur second i dont respectfully i think justice souter way credit provision worded saying liability imposed accepted petitioners position would point crediting provision first tribunal decide would preclusive effect there wouldnt nothing would nothing credit no justice scalia 903e crediting provision is simply says 905a means exclusivity means double recovery jones act suit with respect state tort remedies exclusivity as court pointed footnote 3 gizoni means person covered longshore act it doesnt say decides position district court jury jones act suit would opportunity decide whether worker member crew the question one yes yes answer yes detrimental reliance let maybe im concrete would helpful answer if brought district court worker said count 1 im jones act seaman count 2 im longshore worker wouldnt problem the jury could decide status thats correct and happened justice oconnor instead paying maintenance cure boatmans agreement deck hands case petitioner pay maintenance cure would traditional seamans remedy petitioners theory would leverage say im going pay voluntary benefits longshore act either question hardship really arise injured worker may i answer question mr chief justice our position congress intend injured maritime workers left without interim remedy pursued status justly awarded the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,296.0,461,17,so is view one thing bothering question i mean remember question no well question basically is rule governments rule says proceeding first proceeding bind employee also applicable employer yes there possibility 16 boxes matrix ive worked you kinds permutations combinations i confining question instance longshoreman proceeding comes first one side could win the jones act comes second i want certain position government first proceeding bind seaman thats youve argued brief employee right thats brief and i take it also position bind employer for either party you wont say either party im getting worried it intend either party thank and i dont know i thought collateral estoppel i didnt know difference if called issue preclusion wouldnt confusion right i took civil procedure years ago used say res judicata two parts i cant even remember well then im laughter all i know i employer i would want know im employee i called longshoreman i bring case employee er comes says hey guy called longshoreman thats end matter say isnt right now i want know opposite happens the person called seaman employer comes says hey understand opposite okay now i want know reaches exactly result after year can year i didnt ask whether within year i asked year if within year cannot is correct if hasnt filed something within year he must within year and filed paper within year thats i wanted know it took long time get though i must say its automatic has discretion it right so automatic so he get somebody graciously give extension lets precise rights does opposite hold true view jones act suit decided first it preclusive effects longshoreman act case are saying simply administrative adjudications heavy issuepreclusive effect judicial proceedings and thats hornbook law well what invokes intent congress thats i take thats general principle procedure you said arguing congress specific intent well maybe congress anticipated normal rules civil procedure in one direction wouldnt preclusion that would make sense congressional credit scheme youre saying 905e affected explain isnt case interpretation 905e effectively repeals 905a the crediting provision right but thats says says liability harbor workers act exclusive cant get recovery im still confused i know youre end time ive opportunity ask clarify please point tried address previously justice breyer apparently think employer could equitably estopped asserting contrary positions one forum fora employee never would equitably estopped take inconsistent positions is i mean cant answered yes well doesnt give opposite answer i i mean i interested practicalities i wanted sure parallel treatment going real parallel treatment isnt im trying think general terms case but real live case employee says district court i seaman i injured and employer says werent you anything longshoreman well voluntary the employer pay longshoreman harbor workers act predetermination benefits thank mr frederick the case submitted,33,29,0.0,641.0

Jama,Immigration and Customs Enforcement,5.0,4.0,0,1157.0,1405,17,mr chief justice may please court the eighth circuits decision petitioner citizen national somalia deported somalia reversed the applicable removal statute requires acceptance country alien subject national citizen that statute 8 usc 1231 b2d david referred step two the eighth circuit acknowledged acceptance required removal the parties agree somalia functioning government give acceptance case term used statute that correct your honor the circuit court ruled however petitioner could deported somalia statute provides alien removed country citizenship removed list additional countries next step statute 1231b2e including country birth the circuit court erred ruling following reasons your honor the statute structured sets forth congress set forth order respect deportation process set forth example order countries chosen identity countries chosen the statute get order deportation process alien removed situation government receive alien alien simply expelled united states risk arises alien bounce back united states simply international traffic country receive alien theres nothing statute would indicate interest congress ordering removal process limited simply limited simply concern sovereignty nations country mr chief justice the contending the statute invests right individual what contending statute expressed statute acceptance requirement would apply removal process your honor i would i would suggest yes yes i would i would suggest to give reading one limit view first six clauses however i would suggest that would would take subparagraph e out context several important theres important your honor i would i would suggest that thats case following reasons first way e begins says alien removed country previous subparagraphs the first priority is country subject nationality citizenship acceptance requirement in moving e your honor the e doesnt change removal process it adds for executive branch adds additional countries countries remove your honor your honor the says alien removed country previous subparagraphs that moving give attorney general additional countries remove it doesnt change process look example i think get guidance point looking clause vii obviously part of subparagraph e ends words another country whose government accept alien country another country whose government accept alien country what gives us references back first six clauses reflects fact acceptance requirement always present it it depend upon emphasis give i would suggest going going read e mean congress intended youre going acceptance requirement removal d step two subject nation citizenship country going move e going give list countries presumably less less closer connection alien d and respect countries ones clauses vi going acceptance requirement but going put back in clause vii go country get acceptance i would suggest that a sensible reading i i didnt it didnt find anything explained i would i would suggest reinforces point thats that correct your honor that correct the we one amicus briefs gives legislative history reference major report judiciary committee connection 96 legislation says whole section the ina is restating the previous law so thats thats two reasons your honor first language d it says remove subject national citizenship country unless government country affirmatively inform acceptance or and i would i would suggest the consequence unless language unless happens dont but would my suggested reading language but second reason going structure statute i think reinforces and important it congress intent government couldnt remove country citizenship couldnt get acceptance could move step e remove anyway overcome acceptance congress would gone writing statute way the way wrote statute provided e countries the attorney attorney general could remove every one countries different country country citizenship definition it would would strange way the congress given attorney general discretion remove anyway make contingent upon one countries clauses vi happen country country subject nationality citizenship the i think the best way approach statute i think it shed light on question start premise removal is transfer alien government united states government country removal and removal so start premise makes absolute sense wouldnt place the statute identifies a country statute would say make specific reference acceptance requirement my point reading statute way terms general condition explains throughout statute would the reference acceptance context appears wouldnt repeat every place where referenced country removal it would in removal process require acceptance country removal now the reason it would fit with statute congress statute expressed interest orderly process deportation if lets take two examples your honor if the country removal refuses want will take alien back government refuse the reason makes sense acceptance requirement deportations make less likely deportee going bounced around international traffic come back united states the i i a wholly unreasonable claim government acceptance i think alien the government take position lets say in in case government agrees admits acceptance but lets say government took position say we call anything acceptance we ship united states wholly unreasonable definition acceptance then alien circumstance able access courts able challenge that decision well you know the acceptance willing receipt the alien country removal the instances know come from tom man case decided second circuit 1958 and case government wanted take alien border communist china see whether could get across border and and construing this provision language in 1952 judge learned hand for court said that acceptance required step three subparts that would violate statute we know instances your honor answer question terms procedures in 1950s 60s government would would take remove alien hong kong situations hong kong authorities may may send alien to china but there always every opinion from time statute went effect 1952 eighth circuits decision jama said statute means steps acceptance required we dont dont know and government has cited we say cant no your honor the reason statute deals removal aliens removal proceedings in situation presumably would happen those aliens would excluded they would subject probably expedited removal different statute were dealing aliens admitted united states it yes the statute it starts in 2 1231b2b aliens 1 arriving aliens removal proceedings yes it and given fact statute originally passed 1952 1952 know legislative history enormous concern fact the communist countries would receive back citizens so concern communist agents aliens united states couldnt deport what congress statute 1952 it didnt change acceptance requirement it expanded list countries government could deport those countries yes there yes it mean separate reason under e petitioner cannot removed somalia country properly defined statute and let give i think good history the board immigration appeals in 1985 linnas case specifically addressing e term country said country statute two things territory functioning government exercised sovereignty people well i i i dont i dont know if i point pointed in briefs whole series cases i i mentioned bia decision theres whole series cases in 1950s 1960s said country functioning government ill ill give one one good example ying case where court circuit court said dealing whether hong kong could a country and said hong kong following characteristics it legislative body it characteristics political organization your honor it this new claim new issue it argument issue presented whether petitioner removed country birth e functioning government either object accept and since country cant well your honor i would i would quote the governments phrasing question in your honor it doesnt specifically say it i would say go government country acceptance so must refer back i would also cite fact your honor issue specifically addressed by parties district court it dissenting opinion eighth circuit the dissent specifically raised as matter terms it addressed majority opinion your honor i would i would questions time id like save rest time rebuttal i would like respond pointing the point justice souter raised respect language statute prior 1996 my brother counsel quote important part statute effect time its set forth on 6a brief petitioner and critical part says thereupon deportation alien shall directed country alien subject national citizen country willing accept territory that language appear statute prior 1996 that language statute 1952 first passed found page 1a 1b of brief i would also like point terms of interpreting statute also helpful look statutes passed 1996 specifically alien terrorist statute government gets remove someone whos classified alien alien terrorist that statute 8 usc 1537b starting page 8a brief says specifically alien terrorist shall removed country whose government willing accept alien i would submit fact congress going going removal requirement applies clearly alien terrorists certainly demonstrates this requirement always part statute and 1996 congress consistent interpretations congress also 1996 fact tens thousands aliens could deported years countries would accept and 1996 restated statute facts also consistent judicial history interpreted statute always require acceptance as result could apply principle watchdog barking night thank the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,649.0,864,23,well hear argument next no 03674 keyse jama v ins mr keyes mr keyes talking removability i mean sense dispute whether could removed its question removed may i ask preliminarily mr keyes the government takes position statute whatever means intended with nation abroad view idea insult our neighbors world community recognize prerogative say yes somebody sent removed statute intended confer benefit removable alien but need dont are saying theres interest indication congress concerned subject talking but need something affirmative say statute confirms right private individual well possible read statute particularly part e first series subsections eighth circuit that possible reading statute find indeed acceptance requirement many little subsections or i say clauses perhaps yes well i im sure thats right when i read statute whole went possibilities got e read though end day congress want provide place removal people absence acceptance right well obviously congress prefers country act acceptance that thats understandable e appeared least things exhausted going still allow removal little subclause ii iii iv vi well doesnt begin way it doesnt begin alien cannot removed country previous subparagraphs it says alien removed country previous subparagraphs and whether is subject discretion attorney general none sentences paragraphs requires removal countries so says the attorney general additional options i mean youd stronger argument it read cannot removed doesnt of course well i mean clause could could read either way another country whose government accept alien one way read another way read another country whose government accept alien and thats thats thats ambiguity do know did come across anything explained change language clause vii 1952 version present one the 52 one said country willing accept alien territory vii said another country whose government accept alien do know anything is accident drafting simply drafting style something yes it helps quite lot says government doesnt time doesnt it doesnt help respect whether vii applies first six it help respect win point thats theres government otherwise could argue one one argument least view would certainly help reading e interpretation put d and and justice scalia i i think two different interpretations d requires youre saying that d fact require a the country if attorney general designates the country citizenship requirement d the country accept whereas earlier question that spoke of issue e whether alien is removed opposed cannot removed his earlier question indicates the possible reading acceptance requirement d and i understand governments argument it d requires attorney general turn country of citizenship country citizenship accept respond the consequence attorney general cannot deport country simply longer required act discretion what answer argument absolute acceptance requirement merely acceptance requirement maintain attorney generals obligation return country well says attorney general shall remove unless and argument if dont get condition satisfied ie acceptance theres longer mandate ie shall it simply leaves open matter discretion what i think strange is read back clauses vi phrase whose government accept alien i mean if acceptance condition preceding things goodness thats certainly way make clear tag onto vi instead putting introduction clause comes vii goes margin you want us read back vi whose government accept alien so read read statute united states never send somebody back country doesnt want is why would would congress ever want impose categorical requirement can alien challenge decision attorney general yes certain country accepted so alien litigate issue it seems rather strange if take airport either gets plane doesnt i dont see litigate you know whether theyll accept you deliver what happened china i mean comes 52 act big issue didnt recognize communist china would take people border how work were instances 52 act would take somebody macau something push across border what happened how work now instances deported people places said wont take anyway okay then another and say cant law so state opens prisons puts criminals boat sends united states happened past interpretation statute congress forbidden president shipping criminals back came long country expelled doesnt want criminals back is what saying is statute limited the united states turned boats back the notorious case world war world war ii entered world war ii but whats bothering partly case argued ground like country says dont want in fact country hasnt said dont want its country hasnt said anything its country perhaps and thats really issue whether place without government place send and maybe evidentiary changed word add word government word country throughout simply assuming place organized government is is anything want say all right now word country probably appears immigration statute context deportation since first statute provided so done work i i hate sort look first time the work report respect word country there never easiest thing would if word country never statute used word country deportation place organized government if could affirm thats would strong but maybe isnt i thought government said you didnt raise question didnt argue somalia wasnt country well doesnt seem question actually presented petition certiorari well youre youre bound question presented whether attorney general remove alien one countries designated statute without obtaining countrys acceptance alien prior removal now doesnt say anything absence government it doesnt say specifically generally was addressed majority opinion very well mr keyes mr stewart well hear thank mr keyes the case submitted,943.0,1526,34,mr chief justice may please court the plain language 8 usc 1231b2eiv authorizes removal alien country birth undisputed petitioner born somalia by terms statutory authorization conditioned acceptance receiving countrys government i mean we narrowed way feel thats question squarely court that court well weve also indicated the logical thrust arguments effect individual could removed otherwise permissible country notwithstanding lack acceptance functioning central government somalia one well obviously we opposed certiorari petition so contending practical importance question would necessarily justify courts expenditure resources there square circuit conflict well i think reason one reasons framed question petitioners last argument brief read effect whatever text statute might say established understanding decades removal permitted absence acceptance receiving countrys government and part point wanted make dont think understanding sort could trump test text but even court decided established understanding pervasive extratextual limitation removal authority read understanding could thought exist cases functioning central government resisted aliens return without although i i think left one word is crucial position necessarily turns proposition get acceptance simply country government country i mean would submit well first would would submit question presented presupposes somalia country but leaving question aside i think lot good reasons even court felt issue properly it hold somalia country if go department state web site somalia listed independent state it continues member state united nations notwithstanding absence functioning central government if somalia regarded country state reason absence government presumably people formerly somali nationals would rendered stateless thats result international law generally were saying saying first antarctica somalia countries its exceedingly its extremely unlikely that the text statute could ever satisfied permitted removal countries countries country exactly so event we think somalia country it continues regarded notwithstanding current lack existence functioning central government there portion somaliland somalia known somaliland set government characterizes separate country united states government recognized claim country so somalia purposes remains intact id like focus text relevant statutory provisions i dont know ultimately happened alien as case described amicus brief alien flown ethiopia he refused border flown back and i think would consistent representation historically attempted repatriate aliens objection functioning central government that i think measure inconvenience hes flown back would say even court held statute requires acceptance receiving countrys government would necessary us obtain prior assurance acceptance rather would still permissible option us fly alien border people told let would say falls im im sorry fly port entry would presented the immigration customs officials relevant foreign country acceded entry apprised would say constitutes acceptance receiving countrys government right i mean here barrier sense barrier much acceptance that practical matter order accomplish removal alien somalia going put plane he going flown airport somalia people airport guns presumably exercise de facto control gets allowed deplane and people willing let mr jama country hell flown back wont able accomplish repatriation the barrier potential barrier wont acceptance there wont acceptance wont acceptance people would regard government somalia and i think significant point terms foreign relations united states that reconciliation process goes hope conditions somalia become stable the people purport exercise governmental authority gain control the territory consent population certain point state department make decision things progressed far enough characterize government somalia and determination shouldnt skewed judicial ruling state department makes determination repatriation aliens country prohibited if i could turn the text statute provision rely course is subsection eiv thats page 4 governments brief headed additional removal countries it says alien removed country previous subparagraphs paragraph attorney general secretary homeland security shall remove alien following countries and roman iv country alien born by terms gives unqualified approval removal country birth neither introductory language subsection clause iv conditions authorization acceptance receiving countrys government and also well let let turn court first page 3 governments brief text current subsection d i think maybe help explain best way would formulate interpretation subsection d slightly different way that characterized earlier subsection d says alien removed country designated subparagraph ai attorney general shall remove alien country alien subject national citizen unless government country fails give consent and interpretation purpose subsection d expresses strong preference removal country nationality assuming designation made but congress recognized make absolute requirement even circumstances acceptance would embroil executive branch foreign policy confrontations essentially even executive branch officials believed would unwarranted affront foreign states try remove face foreign resistance statute without exception would telling attorney general and congress understandably enacted an exception requirement says acceptance attorney general doesnt remove now would would we would say discretion but i i agree that generally international practice now i would i would categorically promise i think practical matter context would impossible but take another hypothetical situation well says shall unless right unless theres acceptance thats correct that thats that thats correct i dont remember well first well first two court appeals decisions weve pointed attempt remove alien actually thwarted basis acceptance receiving countrys government second learned hand unquestionably distinguished judge infallible presumably would court laughter and i think i think and i think i think exactly exactly exactly exactly the point court treat lower court opinion authoritative statement law means meant would inversion judicial no our point statute would raised concern exception that statute said terms removal country designated attorney general shall remove alien country citizenship nationality didnt include exception attorney general would placed situation least potentially forced felt forced law attempt repatriation even though knew government country didnt accept aliens return and prevent sort foreign policy confrontation exception written the exception terms exception mandate it intended its exception subparagraph iv subparagraph no im reading language subsection d im im e im subsection d okay were saying subsection eiv mandate attorney general secretary must remove it says shall remove one following countries clearly intended mandate introductory introductory doesnt choose one introductory language roman vii says impracticable inadvisable impossible remove alien dot dot dot so specifically contemplates possibility situations may arise practicable possible advisable remove alien foregoing countries and certainly one i think i mean to give slight variance hypothetical justice scalia posed future i think would always impossible if instance future president mexico embarked aggressive program encouraging aliens encouraging mexican nationals leave country illegally mexican government refused take back i think would least possible it would option president would want consider repatriate people objection mexican government and president attempting negotiate satisfactory resolution hypothetical crisis wouldnt want hamstrung statutory barrier so makes perfect sense say one hand acceptance receiving countrys government secretary never required remove country would enmesh executive branch international confrontation its inconsistent say nevertheless secretary believes repatriation without acceptance done consistent foreign relations objectives the united states government statutory option as practical matter i guess wed two responses the first would agree view predecessor language would forbid removal country nationality absent acceptance statute said government relevant foreign country doesnt accept doesnt advise attorney general stance five six lines page 2a says deportation shall directed attorney general within discretion without necessarily giving priority preference order herein set forth either theres series countries one country alien born thats correct i guess point would make yes we would would disagree statement yes we would disagree that appropriate result prior statute the thing would say point otherwise correct subsection eiv general matter subsection eiv says alien may removed country birth whether acceptance would make sense say cant also country current nationality citizenship removal country current country current nationality citizenship preferred country removal thats the statutory scheme also country international law obligation well i think petitioners reliance subsection d effect however would otherwise read subsection e subsection d deals specifically removal country nationality citizenship dont meet prerequisites removal country d cant end run resorting e and im saying works could work e invoked authorize removal country current nationality citizenship it d couldnt negative implications attempting remove somebody somalia born even though currently national citizen different country they dont include practical matter i think state nationality is always virtually always going covered include country birth country alien departed enter united states country previously resided country thats sovereignty exercises sovereignty country born one reason possible reason parsing way congress e sometimes reason foreign government doesnt give acceptance may foreign government disputes contention individual national country order avoid recapitulation dispute subsection e stage congress might least though e going turn objective factors factors unlikely subject dispute potentially contested question country the aliens current country nationality the thing id like say the two policy justifications petitioner given the one reading statute necessary order prevent government entangled foreign confrontations and view executive branch well equipped prevent happening that long statute doesnt require us attempt repatriation objection another foreign government executive branch exercise discretion attempt course action believe consonant foreign policy goals the united states the policy objection reading petitioner advances places without functioning central governments likely dangerous congress would wanted prohibit removal country alien would face hardships and dont attempt minimize potential hardship alien removed somalia network federal statutory provisions specifically address question resistance removal based potential harm receiving country and petitioner cant qualify unlikely congress would intended absence functioning central government serve sort prophylactic surrogate dangerous dangerousness and worth noting respect secretary homeland security currently administers temporary protected status program covers somalia it contains broad protections removal aliens petitioner ineligible relief provision criminal conviction thank your honor,709.0,1065,18,why narrow question presented brief youre willing take that much categorical position much important position government when the question presented describe brief whether immigration officials may remove petitioner country birth country lacks functioning central government able either accept object petitioners thats much narrower question than one presented petitioner thats want us decide well i i dont think logical thrust necessarily we way question presented suggests deciding case people going deported somalia areas world functioning government thats i wouldnt voted take case so much narrower yes odd petitioners question broader turned whether acceptance as i i understand following bit justice scalia question presented whether remove alien one countries designated without obtaining countrys acceptance okay now one possible prior alien prior removal thats im reading cert petition but cert petition says without obtaining countrys acceptance alien now i grant sort hidden argument mentioned whatever is one reason answer question is country functioning government country within meaning country used statute now thats thats answer question presented narrow reason get us involved anything somalia is i mean maybe shouldnt reach it wasnt argued much seemed another argument advanced favor position so youre saying dump people antarctica possibly send moon antarctica country so could take people send antarctica theyll live penguins is if born raised penguins send laughter before could tell outcome southern district texas case relied decision eighth circuits decision send someone ethiopia without consent is anything practical objection get person country wont accept sent left unless dump sea you dont fly border you fly airport usually isnt border but win one doesnt say anything prior vii whether whether government people guns right mr stewart may i interrupt oh im may i interrupt ask ask question youre right textually theres theres nothing iv that condition of prior approval the argument one argument made substantial overlap of subsections e country of nationality citizenship d recognize a requirement acceptance e categories basically youre going end run around d the governments answer argument i understand as i tried to put question your friend absolute requirement acceptance d there simply a attorney generals mandate send person a country citizenship is subject but country accept attorney general still discretion send country there one answer that brother get i i want raise as i understand house report 96 act current statute anyway the house report indicated intent change substance provisions dealt prior statute and prior statute set on page 1a petitioners brief seems clear absolute requirement acceptance attorney general act predecessor language subsection d if look within the three lines from bottom of page 1a refers there seems clear condition country willing accept territory now im reading old law right house report reflect taken us interpretation reflect intent congress dont say attorney generals authority merely mandate authority d requires acceptance and therefore take view would effect allow end run around condition indeed attorney general could simply say okay im going go little iv e im going find country birth i dont get acceptance it happens country citizenship but goes least border goes whats answer argument so if acceptance remove if acceptance discretion that doesnt make i interrupt i want ask question i started that doesnt make sense if read mandatory requirement attorney general shall assume existing government narrowed question so im talking question if theres existing government cannot command government accept alien the general practice among nations would nation obligation accept people back but wont cant force take person back how could say send person back great britain say going take how what could attorney general possibly so word shall cannot mean shall he cannot every case unless theres acceptance i guess could say shall everything possibly mandate evaporates theres acceptance wait minute were put two questions were going far it doesnt say refuse accept if dont respond within 30 days so may well that proceed e respect a country simply responded it inefficient ministry state and guy arrives they say oh were delighted fellow back our response got lost mail something theres no reason cant proceed e existence d but putting three questions together seemed youre saying possible read statute way youre saying it also possible read statute opposite and brief i found helpful this ali ali brief everything set really quite parallel you get every version statute right front and i read look 52 version i think clearer point insofar clearer but addition four circuit courts appeals including decision learned hand say justice souters suggestion statute means theres nothing contrary and congress reenacts statutes little bits i think unclarifying changes language write report dont mean substantive change i think house wrote report right was senate report did president know it house report some people actually read reports feel clue congress trying get and clue clue says substantive change provision unanimously interpreted four circuits including learned hand side so im interested that amazing non sequitur good point good point laughter if believe mr stewart you mean court would infallible laughter okay lets lets erase learned hand let let get answer question in your reading statute mandatory imposes mandatory duty attorney general may able perform may able repatriate alien unless country accept well exception subparagraph iv so reading language subparagraph vii exception subparagraph iv im e and im saying read e way subsection iv mandatory command attorney general may able carry unless comply subsection vii it says shall remove he choose one right and wouldnt always impossible if the country accept alien id rather answer question may may i go back lets say the nub narrow nub of earlier question the predecessor language subsection d i read clearly required approval country removal country repatriation country the house report says dont intend make change substantive law if accept house report weve going say proper reading d reading reading says attorney general cannot act d unless fact an acceptance country and true reading roman iv e allows make end run around condition would good reason interpreting e require agreement acceptance country what response narrow argument so youre saying predecessor language read way say d read okay then you think judge reavley sitting ninth circuit time dissented ali ali case dead wrong said prior statute condition willing acceptance countries aliens could deported he thinks dissent turns difference current statute prior statute i havent followed would say make argument thats thats one choices e it doesnt vii dont include state nationality thank mr stewart mr keyes 3 minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,5,-17,214.0,-60.0

says ought answering kinds questions court unanimously held gaudin respectfully eleventh circuit squarely wrong say right jury trial first codified law nation isnt substantial right im argue thin case i responding justice ginsburgs case question im argue right jury trial citizens country historically place jurisprudence court reinforced time time eleventh circuit wrong government wrong they say weve waived right forfeited objecting this in two respects justice breyer one case court misinstruct element it totally omitted element well well i could go back earlier question answer first sir second thing different case misinstruction element addition totally omitting eleventh circuit pattern jury instruction number 43 taken cases thats found joint appendix your honor page 67 instruction taken precedent old fifth circuit prior congress creating eleventh circuit carrying precedent fifth eleventh provided jury indeed instructed materiality matter involved alleged false testimony matter concerned rather question court decide and went instructed questions asked defendant alleged constituted material matters grand jury proceedings referred indictment respectfully justice breyer partial directed verdict criminal case its misdescription element and way cases tried voir dire opening statement closing argument instructions within structural framework elements thats way lawyers well absolutely and even trial trial counsel filing motions limine trial counsel lawyers try cases believe precedent believe youre face longstanding precedent principled lawyering waste time making frivolous objections i dont think face 50 years precedent circuit that would appropriate way handle you cant invite no maam i believe solicitor general indicated doesnt urge position i still even i dont think invited error invited without waiver stipulation wasnt there motions limine prior trial case seeking limit evidence going jury grounds would relevant materiality government allowed violation rule 403 put evidence relevant nothing prejudicial well know reading cases justice kennedy thats good question i think theyre tried differently three four different protocols depending upon circuit youre but respectfully i trial counsel seeking exclude evidence could relevant materiality going jury trial counsel was face massive precedent thats dictated not element going going jury i also affirmatively going direct verdict favor government i find well respectfully well respectfully wrong entity judging defendant guilty the trial judge took away jury 25 percent jury trial she got would like going fourdog dog fight get three going take one away respectfully wrong entity judging defendant guilty respectfully i believe error goes next line circuit court appeals theyd say three us going substitute 12 citizen jurors opinion evidence might there nothing harmless error analysis attach there jury verdict there object upon well valid jury verdict threequarters constitution history country says us well i dont think directed verdict case partial directed verdict not taken away jury judge told dont bothered dont concern i find both defense government that instruction place fifth circuit eleventh circuit pattern jury instructions since 1985 district judges association promulgated instructions interesting circuits know tenth circuit ninth circuit en banc ruling harmful error per se reversal take different approaches types cases fall two distinct categories some circuits pattern jury instructions say dont concern materiality i would want rephrase say theres three distinct some say dont concern materiality some pattern jury instructions used say nothing jury they instruct jury three elements perjury oath false statement knowing say nothing false statements in eleventh circuit submit adds double injury plaintiff defendant case judge says dont concerned materiality i find egregious instructions i respectfully submit two different theories require reversal theyre violations fifth theyre violation fifth sixth amendment im familiar old chief because youre wrong entity making decision in addition prior occurring trial trial i wont say prior i dont frankly recall record clear counsel made rule 29 motion judgment acquittal directed 29 motion materiality materiality hotly litigated throughout course case returning earlier point motions limine objections motion judgment acquittal done mind set knowing judge going instructed jury thats structural defect proceedings render absolutely meaningless there meaningful jury verdict there case i submit anybody cite says homicide case court take away one elements that isnt way work we whole idea jurys conscience the conscience citizens greater judges thats early colonial times country right jury trial hammered its right ive located federal constitution explicitly pointed three different places if ask 100 lawyers get right jury trial tell sixth amendment knowing yes sir well order rule government youd go along eleventh circuit say going grant relief counsel didnt object if wed made frivolous objection isnt legal irony well constitutional right jury trial embodies profound judgment way law enforced justice administered it structural guarantee well certainly thats system laughter and happens theres doubt happens but ask 100 laymen went fourdog fight got three dogs fight government remember part value jury trial protect citizens government perjury government its one specific crimes government probably well knowing different materiality they different elements totally i respectfully submit order follow reasoning eleventh circuit youve got call right jury trial nonsubstantial right substantial right respectfully i dont think but i think directed verdict opaque its clear so twostep analysis twostep deprivation omission knowing im going tell ladies gentlemen jury knew i think total denial right jury trial and i appreciate correction your honor laughter well i agree i believe taking away affirmative statement coupled entire framework case traveled longstanding precedent i respectfully submit fundamental structure trial wrong counsel relied longstanding precedent overruled griffith ruling gaudin retroactive proceedings i think elements must found jury i think thats gaudin stands sullivan i think case stronger simply affirmative direction verdict partial verdict but returning justice breyers question court ticked rights structural rights per se reversible i think time court put teeth language cases go back 1945 screws go back if id opportunity argue jury one say i could prevailed ms johnson could i would well i think draw line i think thats way cases post gaudin cases going come system number 1 i think theres omission directed verdict sure defendant prevails if merely omission im sure i know extreme given trial case totally based precedent longstanding affected entire performance strategy thinking handling case handling witnesses handling jury instructions i clairvoyant known going gaudin think i would asked jury instruction number 43 only i totally ineffective without petitioner right entity making decision caused conviction ill reserve time thank mr chief justice i think language bollenbach v united states cabana v bullock i may refresh court words question whether guilt may spelled record whether guilt found jury according procedures standards appropriate criminal trials that bollenbach in cabana language findings made judge cannot cure deficiencies jurys findings guilt innocence defendant resulting courts failure instruct find element crime the entire rationale plain error rule prevent lawyers sandbagging is sandbagging follow halfacentury precedent certainly to follow governments argument going cause lawyers experienced lawyers object everything solicitor say lot precedent going country trial flat wrong if read ninth circuit opinion gaudin find thats 1001 case this court characterized ninth circuit maverick circuit issue finally regard ninth circuit case 1001 case this 1623 case time trial precedent ninth circuit materiality perjury case different 1001 argument helps court well i would respectfully submit least two circuits theyve got stay orders en banc cases awaiting decision case i dont know lawyer knows circuits yet i think important case signal trial bar as structural matter i would ask court harken language duncan v louisiana case applied sixth amendment right jury trial states fourteenth amendment it structural guarantee reflects fundamental decision exercise official power reluctance entrust plenary powers life liberty citizen one judge group judges apply 52b 52a indeed you pulling rug sixth amendment contrary history i think history tried set forth history and i cannot good conscience answer question directly i know i respectfully submit many cases structural cases objections didnt i say rule requiring contemporaneous objection yes sir thank the honorable court adjourned tommorow ten oclock,596.0,867,23,well hear argument number 96203 joyce johnson v the united states mr sheppard mr sheppard element still case it believed materiality judge didnt prove materiality difference proof said shaped trial attorneys strategy the element proved what different proof presented materiality would trier jury rather judge well example could show us trial counsel might made materiality statements matter tried jury well eleventh circuit certainly didnt doesnt agree precedent said reviewing record case find overwhelming evidence materiality johnsons statement no reasonable juror could conclude johnsons false statements source money material theyre may said may i simply reading said evidence materiality talking you say determined jury thats different thing saying thin case materiality no every day week common thing judge misinstruct jury element defense in case jury considered whether person did commit element that happens every day week common now case different no one thinks deprives person doesnt object right jury trial case how case differ well thats true difference sometimes would fair sometimes less fair misinstruction your case one wasnt unfair in cases misinstructions disastrous draw line well also true counsel isnt true trial government tried put evidence materiality jury court petitioners trial lawyer wouldnt allow grounds judge who said absolutely keep evidence well could invited error case defeat petitioners subsequent claim petitioner said may consider materiality i would thought invited error could defeat claim now eleventh circuit didnt decide issue i guess but judge make materiality determination relevant judges determination you dont exclude jury judge hears materiality evidence maybe im wrong i dont think well frank i guess whats troubling us really strong materiality case evidence would come would argued either judge jury absent jury present instruction jury really concern its little hard us grasp plain error aspect reversible error aspect case didnt think materiality question either judge jury even wall precedent is position simply couldnt harmless error analysis situation well jury verdict finding person guilty well valid jury verdict elements could possible could weve said earlier cases jury found elements 1 2 3 would necessarily found element 4 if established would problem would wouldnt establish harmless error i mean jury never given instruction know beyond reasonable doubt one earlier cases involved jury said nothing but jury said three things its conceivable three things could automatically implicitly include fourth isnt who asked instruction mr sheppard sometimes evidence particular element strong defendant would rather jury confront element case term so told element least eleventh circuit thought proof overwhelming trial record defense counsel saying please judge dont say word materiality jury know case isnt i dont think anyone disputes importance jury trial im difficulty handful things court said structural right handful and i dont find anywhere handful case law though i grant somewhat open though i think roy removed habeas context made clear wasnt structural context structural fact judge decided matter jury decided i grant thats wrong thing equivalent using know beyond reasonable doubt failing i mean one handful things thats critical importance in case doesnt seem wrong what im looking actually miscarriage justice kind standard thats im focusing yes mr sheppard know kinds things go wrong jury trials judges give opaque charges could look jury dont know heck judge talking accept mr sheppard let test whether think thing structural narrow sense opinions used lets assume prosecution burglary evidence introduced window broken know entry the defendant counter argument his defense introduced people somewhere else he alibi defense the judge forgets tell jury order convict must find defendant knowingly broke entered house now heres broken window guy walked somebody walked know dark carefully took things house its possible i suppose well possible its simply possible jury found breaking entering fellow would also found knowingly on evidence one finding implicitly includes now would say that conviction reversed judge tell jury find knowingly done well structural if say structural error yes client but mr sheppard supposing justice scalias example judge said dont worry knowing im going tell evidence strong enough establish point well answer justice scalia one i think no trouble answering i like man accepts help offered laughter well i dont the trouble answering way client fact better happened justice scalias hypothetical case rather would case hypothetical actual finding made materiality whereas hypothetical whether knowing simply ignored your client better well yes youre saying better ignore element completely finding element finding nonjury finding then shouldnt answer different knowing example knowing example jury never made finding knowingly never thought but see problem im actually suppose told jury jury know materiality means it means well sort likely maybe make difference then wouldnt well fit is structural error he really says materiality jury materiality means well something little bit im trying focus whats bothering one would draw distinction though cases one would draw distinction misinstructions really stupid instructions offthewall instructions instructions seems like bog and accept view right middle thats very well mr sheppard mr dreeben mr sheppard say governments argument circuits adopted rule dont raise objection come within provisions even objection would futile hasnt produced apparently circuits flood futile objections contend occur mr sheppard isnt cases complaints sixth amendment violation women werent put juries defendants got benefit rule ones made contemporaneous objection im thinking particularly doran v missouri thank mr sheppard the case submitted,1271.0,1918,17,mr chief justice may please court id first like address plain error rule applies case turn question petitioner entitled relief plain error rule now federal rules criminal procedure impose contemporaneous objection requirement party wishes assign error either trial court appeal provisions set forth brief appendix page 3a the first rule federal rule criminal procedure 30 states party may assign error portion charge omission unless party objects thereto jury retires consider verdict rule 51 amplifies requirement stating exceptions necessary sufficient party time ruling order court made makes known court action party party desires court take petitioner comply two provisions she object courts instruction materiality indeed sought make argument widely made defendants around country time trial materiality decided jury rather judge result failing comply contemporaneous objection requirement two rules source reviewing claim error wishes make rule 52b federal rules criminal procedure justice ginsburg i think ninth circuit keys decision stating principle articulated actually simply say allow people raise claims preserved error even objection actually defense counsel instructed dont object but one takes ninth circuits rule instruction defense counsel object need object i think ninth circuit simply violated federal rules criminal procedure 30 51 the ninth circuit cannot announce supervisory rule procedure direct conflict federal rules criminal procedure actually i think makes difference whatsoever justice kennedy the reason if one looks way judicial system works appellate perspective court rarely ever entertain claim raised preserved trial court court appeals even onpoint authority potential petitioner time the court expects parties comply relevant contemporaneous objection rules even objection time might deemed futile governing authority good reasons the first shows party really cares issue in case petitioner really wanted jury resolve materiality issue petitioner would manifested acquiescing instruction requesting instruction taking materiality away jury everything petitioner could make point wanted jury decide material well i dont think trial judge would amazed request time trial took place 1995 talking hypothetical plenty examples petitioners preserved claims trial court brought court overruling supreme court precedent no the trial judge would barred circuit law granting request correct well i think strange shows justice scalia one important petitioner value second reason prompt petitioner make offer proof whatever supplementation record petitioner feels appropriate show petitioner would done differently law favor facilitates subsequent review court appeals court whether error occurred you would necessarily differently chief justice rehnquist would show theory petitioner wanted present jury case demonstration petitioner would done differently weve heard today course trial would differently well i think justice oconnor government made preserved claim invited error might well correct way case resolved cases johnson v the united states 318 us we argue invited error court appeals in district court everybody operated assumption materiality would decided judge when gaudin decided petitioner first time raised claim materiality decided judge correct petitioner entitled say based courts intervening precedent error occurred question becomes analyze consequences submission text federal rules criminal procedure require analyzed plain error unless had available us invited error argument made petitioners argument disregard text federal rules criminal procedure either objection would deemed futile error characterized structural somehow structural errors exempt contemporaneous objection requirements neither submissions correct in view textual exception federal rules criminal procedure objections later deemed futile court indeed considering analogous issue habeas context held futility ground excusing procedural default failing raise claim relevant tribunal state system in engle v isaac court squarely held even claim perceived correctly litigant futile cause failing raise well yes justice stevens cases collateral review i think point court thought benefits requiring party object relevant tribunal power decide even onpoint governing law time adverse carve even exercise discretionary authority exception procedural default rule claims would perceived futile i think case follows fortiori express provisions federal rules criminal procedure contain futility exception would even step court carve express text rule exception something even recognized discretionary capacity habeas review well justice kennedy concerned attorneys would want try preserve every conceivable claim chance day court might reverse what dealing i know would justice oconnor i think probably would matter court told point class claims likely result reversal existing precedent time trial appeal petitioner similarly situated petitioner might say law changed i didnt object claim would futile now i good claim hands that class large claim large class claims astute defense counsel care issue watch defense counsel raising materiality objection court excepted gaudin country even en banc ninth circuit decision came certainly decision came raised widely this case tried 6 months ninth circuits en banc ruling gaudin 6 months courts ruling affirming ruling gaudin petitioner clearly notice claim excepted federal court appeals several state courts clearly issue play no justice scalia well i think two separate points one is within rule 52 52b plain error object right to knowledge every circuit tenth circuit ninth circuit accepted view in words circuits addressed issue except en banc tenth circuit en banc ninth circuit held object trial even objection futile within plain error provisions rule 52 claim must evaluated plain error reversed unless plain error two circuits said plain error balance thats position i say squarely incorrect now turning question rule 52b applied treated plain error case two arguments error trial reversed plain error rule the first plain error rule read require error plain time trial time appeal simply time appeal now claim justice scalia i acknowledge courts appeals gone route the dc circuit read rule 52 way required parties raise said claim clear time appeal must also clear time trial order come within rule 52 dc circuit agrees us point dc circuit improvised calls supervening decision doctrine allows review claims new law comes along time appeal i dont think justice scalia i think purpose plain error rule described court united states v frady permit court appeals remedy error gross egregious trial judge derelict noticing even though defense counsel prosecutor brought attention and case like trial court certainly derelict duties sending materiality no it depends chief justice rehnquist clarity law time trial if law time trial clear trial judge notice im supposed send materiality jury defendant prosecutor fail bring trial courts attention trial court nonetheless obligation comply governing law and court described frady situation court appeals may notice plain error trial judge figured even though parties i think justice breyer cases court perhaps one exception involve errors clear trial judge time i first reason i think language rule 52b contemplates brought attention trial judge thing recognized appeal namely obvious error hard say obvious error trial judge miss claim like thats correct well well first response clarify i think language rule say plain time appeal it describes character error called judges attention raised appeal plain error view requires error obvious stages now may forums defendant raise claim horrible miscarriage justice occurred question whether rule vehicle submission well i think court going ultimately ask question comprehended fourth prong olano considering circumstances infringement fairness integrity public reputation judicial proceedings affirm conviction long inquiry part mix end day i think government could live formulation your honor describing the point obviousness time trial dealing rule text various situations arise rule error clear time trial clear time well i dont think court general authority essentially take kind case rule that point description rules 30 51 she object therefore preserve error therefore rule 52b essential source reviewing claim i think court already crossed bridge justice kennedy the court held discrimination selection grand jury structural error thats vasquez v hillery court twice held shotwell case davis case party fails make contemporaneous objection racial composition jury party may well forfeit opportunity get relief claim i accept hypothesis structural right thats claimed i dont agree structural ill take second right thats established didnt become known world court ruled gaudin hypothesis court invent constitutional right that constitutional right one possessed time trial actively asserted litigants around country wanted ruling applied cases well court reach question plain error thats question us today the rules however provide room court say simply going enforce contemporaneous objection requirement justice scalia youre reading rule 52b no i referring contemporaneous objection requirement oh im sorry im i discussing justice kennedy question whether court treat plain error case i see whether analyze error preserved it plain error case right no we proceed second argument error case entitle petitioner relief plain error rule the fourth final prong olano requires court examine whether correcting error serves fairness integrity public reputation judicial proceedings more precisely court said error shall corrected unless seriously affects fairness integrity public reputation judicial proceedings it view case like one would serve fairness integrity public reputation judicial proceedings reverse petitioner never articulated theory properly instructed jury might returned determination statements material until reply brief court never even articulated anything would say issue in trial objected evidence materiality put i think fair reading record defense materiality case the evidence earl fields drugdealing investigated grand jury deemed petitioner prejudicial interests wanted possible jury hear think her defense statements true she opportunity argue trial judge statements immaterial her sole argument consisted onesentence remark i think statements immaterial the trial judge heard evidence examined record concluded statements material the court appeals agreed i think bedrock principle case like one reasonable probability retrial would produce different outcome plain error rule dictates affirmance reversal correct justice ginsburg i think right balance interests court doesnt accept argument obviousness time trial one looking overall weighing process final step olano question foremost courts mind is reasonable probability constitutional error made difference outcome trial if reasonable probability i dont mean likely jury might acquitted court confident fair verdict court affirm if court believes evidence jury might come way petitioner plausible theory trial judge didnt agree maybe jury would interests justice probably counsel favor giving petitioner new trial courts except ninth tenth circuits approached issue the ninth tenth circuits concluded instructional error like structural error we dont think we think structural error kind error affects entire integrity proceedings susceptible harmless error analysis errors relate one jury instruction trial species this court held recently california v roy premise error structural view incorrect so whatever rule court might think would appropriate cases true structural error emerged time appeal case case when turn question whether serves interests justice give petitioner new trial courts appeals except ninth tenth circuits concluded doesnt really case made issue materiality jury that frequently case issue materiality often proved court well knows testimony grand jury foreman says looking drugdealing moneylaundering person therefore asked questions find answers things testimony given jury going decide whether testimony true false materiality centerpiece cases occasionally case materiality hotly contested court appeals might feel cases theres hot contest case might come differently new trial order i honestly think clear justice kennedy trial judge thought standard applied the eleventh circuit never expressly spoken question before courts decision gaudin courts appeals except ninth circuit said materiality legal question some courts nonetheless said well appropriate thing decide question law other courts yes treated question got decided beyond reasonable doubt what clear trial judges findings reviewed record understood focus grand jury investigation understood relevant grand jury know source funds house petitioner purchased potentially laundered drug money boyfriend said record articulated standard i think correct legal standard materiality he said may within purview grand jury investigating i think loose fashion per se this reasonably calculated affect decision grand jury petitioner course never objected trial court said oh youre applying wrong standard materiality nor petitioner ever say havent found requisite degree proof i dont think theres real question trial judge firmly convinced false testimony material court appeals so final submission court case like appropriate response apply plain error rule objection preserved trial treat error nonstructural character examine actual impact thank you,431.0,667,16,mr dreeben i take ninth circuit maybe circuit also court appeals rule dont make rule 30 instruction would futile youve got clear circuit precedent point going way what would approach case case tried ninth circuit came decision cert applied lets assume circuits view materiality question judge i thought thats answer would well least regime hypothesizing theres i think trial judge would quite amazed request well im talking hypothetical would trial judge able grant request so youre saying must make request knows cannot granted a strange position well seems bit odd mr dreeben i take proof materiality would either crossexamining government witnesses im sure youd greatly differently jury would judge how doctrine invited error fit whole picture did government point raise question and case became final but didnt cases turn heavily fact collateral review youre direct review i hard time imagining understanding rule would play maybe would practical consequence on hand might asking us practice every attorney list says your honor i make following list futile objections laughter mr dreeben was case tried ninth circuit decision mr dreeben circuit accepted interpretation rule 52 absolutely refused consider claim raised even circuit law clear because anybody i guess could tell experience circuit whether horrors anticipate occur rule enforced 52 enforced way written it seems sort counterintuitive say clear time trial youre saying youre going forgive counsel raising objection clearly raised hell able get later if know clear time failure raise going conclusive isnt opposite youd expect so youre saying depends kind frame mind judge trial judge whether error plain what would worry sounds history plain error rule meant codify cases court described kind grab bag clear definition designed permit court appeals correct really serious problem serious described one case matter fairness integrity public confidence proceeding you know general shares common something really important went wrong yes could terribly bad i mean depends i couldnt say advance could never terrific miscarriage justice circumstance trial judge knew going i mean restrict way no basic point i take look language rule error plain time appeal judge isnt foreclosed dealing moreover says appellate court realized structural error there element crime jury never considered everyone would say judge said im going submit whole case jury thats pretty big problem its element its element therefore hold matter integrity proceeding say automatically reversible now response first requirement mentioned second response isnt difficulty plain error analysis though mr dreeben plain error rule i think would agree simply devised address situation new rule therefore either take tack youre going apply new rule situation either take tack says plain time trial case newrule case automatically going decided governments favor like sort teague bar case objection going say well going cut like well say sufficient plain time appeal real issue going decided fourth olano prong and would make sense say isnt truly plain error case simply rule new rule cases go right something like fourth olano prong something like harmless error standard structural oh i quite agree i think point im trying make maybe simply cannot sensibly make situation covered rule maybe weve got devise something well structural errors discussed fulminante find that structural error might well something thats different plain error justice souter suggested well course right known established what talking hypothesis dont know well hold way hypothesis structural right established well matter art wrote gaudin seemed would rather difficult say plain error why why i youve said several times i dont see says rule read errors plain defects affecting substantial rights i would understand argument doesnt say it says plain errors may noticed i think thats susceptible interpretation errors time evaluate plain yes thats youre referring all right if plain error case assume sake argument i think plain error like grabbag including errors plain court appeals now assumption assumption lose mr dreeben saying casebycase determination court appeals would look record see much evidence materiality materiality evidence controversial send back new trial was indication record trial judge might applied beyondareasonabledoubt standard materiality thank mr dreeben mr sheppard 4 minutes

valid requiring express consent point proceedings confirm earlier conduct something that would protect voluntariness concerns congress dont believe required in terms authority authority comes voluntary agreement thats evidenced parties proceeded certainly court wished avoid gaming concerns fifth circuit expressed type post judgment consent rule seventh eleventh circuits adopted adopting

written needed express the words expressly consents provision certainly neither word express word oral written exist 636c1 yes we would read statute differently justice stevens fact says upon consent

the local rules provide communication clerk rule 73 provides as matter practice however 1990 congress relaxed consent provisions permit discussions district judge magistrate judge consent could remind parties could consent magistrate judge that topic could discussed in courtroom provided coercion consent if in 1990 congress amended subsection c2 loosen consent requirements certainly still

reverse judgment fifth circuit,593.0,849,35,well hear argument first morning number 0269 joseph roell petra garibay james reagan versus john michael withrow ms eskow how rule 73b do agree consent precede action magistrate so consent took magistrate took action case so hour trial somebody hands counsel note says your honor weve made mistake office said cant consent trial magistrate say late youve appeared youve deemed given consent so like double jeopardy first witness sworn something like so first dispositive motion rules well need whole jurisprudence parallel simple rules didnt follow we need whole jurisprudence thats parallel simple rule the object rule structural sense it bring home parties choice make consider choice make sure choice way forced suggested seems rule defeats was represented trial withrow so rule pro se defendant tell state texas comply federal rules but well can local rules one district produce different result another district didnt local review respect sort consent this local rule require express required consent writing the proceeding didnt do know came magistrate certainly aware and asked state consent whoever representing state said well i authority today and one defendants put form ms eskow statute 636c2 deals clerk court shall notify parties availability magistrate goes say decision parties shall communicated clerk court does use communicated clerk suggest express what requirement how enter and satisfied requirement yes yes and complied fully think subsection 2 may i ask technical question local rule i i recall wherever referred referred rule order does everybody case agree whatever order status local rule purposes case i take argument morning would say defendants suppose lost suppose plaintiff they could say magistrate never authority give advance written permission proceed they could would bound is view but im asking question hypothetically im asking case but defendants lost instead prevailed said aha get never formalized consent you saying could facts case could bowed lost ms eskow i take courts appeals addressed question found express consent required you suggested earlier second sentence of c c1 contains written writing request whereas first second sentence doesnt but writing request second sentence request the magistrate participate rather consent it says upon consent parties pursuant specific written request theres requirement writing respect request first sentence doesnt necessarily disavow need writing evidence consent thats right doesnt written request respect first sentence there one reads the way opponent writing evidencing consent yes thats expressed im saying thats expressed im saying its two writing requirement referred second sentence exact parallel contend the writing requirement first sentence well course thats issue yes thats issue the obvious reading statute like i would think tell im right means consent form judicial conference local rules provide i mean congress perfectly aware procedural statutes judges rulemaking authority elaborate statute rule well also aware theyre writing statute judiciary thats implemented rule term like implemented rule everybody would think would implemented rule word consent statute means consent form rules provide does congress add every time i mean isnt obvious or perhaps isnt isnt so whats wrong i mean local rule okay whats wrong i mean thats rule authorities want no matter law its matter law very often congress legislates use words like consent forth implemented i dont want repeat point i want i want see assume lose sake argument then i guess question whether cure violation objecting appeal and answer because no im saying suppose consent suppose i believe word consent statute picks method rule least rules implied consent suppose i held point still youd say win anyway waive requirement objecting appeal when side appeals say dont care appeal side says dont care we consent what happens now but argument course cant cure basic jurisdictional problem you parties could go street pick third person see say decide case appeal decision somebody says whos person say waive claims isnt judge so say basically isnt jurisdictional strict sense word do think like personal jurisdiction like personal jurisdiction subject matter because say personal side rule general appearance general a rule waives deficiencies my question argument like person street magistrate article iii judge going preside jury trial result trial trappings and dignity enforcement power judgment court united states way could possibly occur parties consent particularly since jury trial dont consent really like person street importance parties giving order obtain judgment rather article iii judge all right thats sides argument now i want know respond one one insulating features suggested form rules civil procedure makes express consent form communicated judge magistrate order protect attorneys dont consent magistrate judge doesnt know party doesnt consent rule completely destroys well you presume regime magistrate said im ready proceed somebody stands says well i dont consent i mean thats thats regime want us adopt that destroys confidentiality where congress you say congress may i make one ask one clarifying question is position it necessary either consent advance consent writing but wasnt finding that occur case the statutory provision that cited provides subsequent discussions predicated fact consent first communicated clerk court so congress basically talked discussion process backdrop consent form already communicated clerk but thats statute says do want reserve remainder time ms eskow ms frost well hear thank ms eskow the case submitted,825.0,1340,21,mr chief justice may please court all parties must expressly consent magistrate may exercise jurisdiction section 636c first foremost text magistrates act rule 73b require express consent in addition id like the word express your honor it rule 73b addition id like point your honor your honor provisions 636c strongly indicate consent must expressed 73b refers use word express your honor neither use term express rule 73b refers the parties shall execute file consent form that written form consent obviously must express it couldnt wouldnt possible file writing consent without express it position written consent required i used word express court need go far case petitioners failed file consent writing 73 requires also failed articulate consent and need reach the question whether consent must writing i i respectfully disagree your honor for example i think everything petitioners consistent intent withhold consent give consent id like show example motion summary judgment filed case petitioners pointed evidence clear consent its captioned to honorable judge district court submitted clerk in addition magistrate may review motion summary judgment 636b without parties consent nothing petitioners submitting motion indicated their intent consent proceedings yes certainly your honor yes yes your honor petitioners argument reason i think argument cannot accord language magistrates act first consent used consistently throughout act mean express statement for example 636h retired magistrate may come retirement serve upon consent the chief judge district court i dont think even petitioners would argue that consent could implied sense chief judge never said wrote retired judge well i respectfully disagree your honor provisions 636h 636c1 use term upon consent i think congress used term throughout statute interpreted meaning thats provision i rely theres fact congress thought consent would communicated parties theres fact congress said upon consent meaning consent must come first it makes sense say consent must come first congress meant simply showing magistrate starts exercising authority going consider consented justice ginsburg answer question federal rules civil procedure rule 12 says showing waiving right statute requires consent important look congress wanted congress clearly concerned consent voluntary willing knowing petitioners agree question best way protect express consent protects consent ensures voluntary i think your honor reasons first nothing would stopped parties from arguing fact hadnt intended consent theres evidence result fact counsel failed specifically consent the argument would make i think state attorney general would say i realized i realized i checked clients i state attorney general took case he could say i realized clients already agreed right article iii judge well i think your honor thats true your honor questions go question whether congress intended different consent standards different parties also question whether congress would want kind satellite litigation question consent i think telling petitioners case asked whether consented said could never consented documents submitted district court captioned district court indicate intended go magistrate would congress wanted courts to deal satellite litigation parties arguing whether didnt consent yes justice ginsburg true case rule explicit consent rather inferred consent established rule far fewer occasions mistakes made yes well i respectfully disagree your honor i think throughout magistrates act legislative history congress referred section 636c expansion magistrates jurisdiction act jurisdiction invoked upon consent parties yes i respectfully disagree justice souter heres its question consenting subject matter jurisdiction question congress say limits magistrates i would put quite terms terms less significant i think congress establish thresholds magistrates exercise jurisdiction separate apart saying federal question case of course agree this case properly federal court the question two prerequisites magistrates exercise authority met one designation district court consent first notice thats i think question thats arguable i would think argument would client point bound attorneys representation clients bound attorneys representations many situations i i think arguable answer i think many important decisions counsel theyre supposed consult client indeed would violation rules professional responsibility didnt instance question consent reason counsel made error frequently litigants mercy counsel yes well justice breyer first response de facto officer doctrine that supposed apply minor errors and i going say important considering fact expressly consented fact trial course cannot court relies justice breyer answer question first congress created jurisdictional threshold second congress aware constitutional issues arise delegate article iii powers nonarticle iii actors reason congress repeatedly stated wanted consent voluntary knowing willing it concerned lessadvantaged litigants might coerced might realize right article iii judge for reason congress uhhuh i think would sufficient your honor would change language statute addition would question would arise would happen attorney general came end process said i didnt consent i think would strong basis record attorney general proceed argument successfully the rule fifth circuit attorney general supposed familiar parties must submit written consent trial fact didnt would strong evidence intended consent then fact pleadings captioned district court fact switching counsel clear whether individuals individual defendants ever consulted ever opportunity object i know customary way pleadings captioned i know looking record case later pleadings issue come magistrate never explicit consent trial later pleadings caption taken i guess point nothing there in summary judgment motion i appealed caps line says honorable judge district court later pleadings line simply removed there nothing but point your honor yes may form caption i dont dispute my point nothing submitting motion summary judgment indicates consent this courts decision caterpillar case held long long diversity met time entry judgment acceptable isnt hypothetical the district court lower courts judgment yes yes your honor no there two answers justice souter the first structural protections personal protections consent requirement as court said cftc v schor congress requires consent consent required serves break delegation article iii authority preserves separation powers required constitution yes because client never consented happened attorney general failing consent i slightly different point im trying make justice souter laughter which end proceeding attorney generals office said oh made didnt mean consent filing written consent form cant consent would new trial course going lost trial i said client didnt consent point client didnt consent go proceeding adversary opportunity decide end case whether i disagree your honor heres magistrates act establishes consent one vital thresholds parties magistrates exercise authority i believe provision youre reading would apply situation congress said magistrate take article iii authority must designation consent i think if district court designated magistrate also error could overlooked yes i agree let answer youre right justice souter let answer question i think posing could harmless error standard applied in words true right clients oh i saw related i i understood question correctly i thought asking i agree yes i i i agree your honor i turning question laughter laughter well respectfully your honor i think related i trying say i agree say people go forward trial theyre stuck question client get raw deal everyones bound would bound lost i going next argument harmless error whether would legitimately something court could apply situation court said magistrate judge jurisprudence also article iii jurisprudence yes i think exactly yes your honor laughter that argument justice stevens statute says upon consent consent must come first therefore simply laughter i agree consent could inferred point i would disagree strongly congress intended inaction equal consent yes exactly i agreed consent could inferred parties conduct meet requirement statute i agree your honor question well congress intend different standard consent applied different cases the congress yes i agree justice kennedy would another reason say yes congress concerns actually apply state attorney generals case i think whats relevant well fact congress clearly couldnt clear use word jurisdiction statute fact legislative history congress expressed concerns voluntariness consent must expressed the counsel petitioners arguing repeatedly referred fact local rules rule 73b protect voluntariness concerns they serve purpose point that congress said consent congress said consent cannot something simply implied go along consent must something communicate clerk it must something clear eight courts appeals respectfully submit already reached conclusion must express consent theyve reached conclusion without court jurisdiction and decisions came amendments magistrates act 1990 96 if congress issue consent requirement read express consent courts concluding jurisdiction without congress could take action taken action didnt i believe that sign congress meant said magistrates act,782.0,1123,28,oh text require express consent i beg differ it i think thats want us interpret i dont think word what part 73b uses word express so neither statute rule use term express suggested earlier well could implied thats question whether consent required appears could implied ever case implying consent case but wasnt trial they participate trial so even filing motion give implied consent perhaps could argued simply participating trial gave but used little bit different sense it requires basically permission chief judge know i think youre quite right saying that would satisfied simply nothing in case youre talking agreement i i think law different in respects why if justice kennedy brought analogy personal jurisdiction if one makes general appearance showing court question whether court would otherwise jurisdiction gone jurisdiction personal jurisdiction consent making general appearance isnt showing magistrates courtroom going trial without objecting isnt equivalent general appearance i could understand abstract in concrete applied case plaintiff pro se plaintiff didnt consent lost i could see argument state attorney general show go trial seems reasonable imply consented well how could made argument case say well forgot rule didnt know i i cant imagine state attorney general would say participated trial say well know i really didnt consent well i mean who attorney generals client except state officials but ms frost well youre asking engage much satellite litigation consent the result position whole new trial going engage court much making determination whether fact state officials consented appearing magistrate but it local rule and dealing consequences i could see big question subject matter jurisdiction youd say parties cant waive kind rule much lower level no youre saying that jurisdiction level i think level subject matter jurisdiction seems youve proved much congress assuming level congress wouldnt done first place you cant consent subject matter jurisdiction cant consent filing written forms trial weve got make assumption justice ginsburg question dealing interest congress viewed lower level no i mean ill ill grant i mean i read statute rule way of course congress mind consent beforehand i think youre right consent in written form the question if consent given whole trial held congress regard subject consent level subject matter jurisdiction could possibly either satisfied by an inferred consent corrected afterwards level subject matter jurisdiction couldnt consent first place weve got assume congress regarded interest something less significant say subject matter jurisdiction 630 636c point talks consent parties now supposing attorney party comes signs consent form loses case can client later come say i never authorized attorney sign consent form but arent bound attorneys representations criminal cases i mean the client must make decision you dont think one i i thought going ask i agree peretz point issue consent the doctrine called de facto officer doctrine means fairly unimportant error waived for example judge sat wrong district judge designated sit judge sick judge died wasnt sick i mean errors court said well go jurisdiction theyre waivable now isnt case like least assume real consent given implied it violates statute right real harm done want waive thats right theyll say sort minor because important given fact gave consent anyway at least showed trial no im asking really answer isnt trivial why important why isnt small enough could waived why grand enough implicates call jurisdictional error parties cant cure cant waive but jurisdictional say doesnt 1653 control title 28 1653 reads defective allegations jurisdiction may amended upon terms trial appellate court a provision like would take care pro se person court could say terms fair hold person pro se litigant consent that person didnt give perfectly appropriate hold state attorney general even grant jurisdiction doesnt 60 1653 take care saying defective allegations jurisdiction may amended even appellate court is customary way southern district texas caption pleading before magistrate judge magistrate judge presiding what later pleadings what happens suppose defective diversity suit get court appeals suddenly discover one defendants state many defendants party says oh dont worry well drop drop appellate stage does rescue whole case what happens i dont know entry judgment lower courts the district court youd say analogy win who suppose intended protected congressional requirements the point question wasnt point protect people didnt want tried magistrate judge answer someone position clients position position object your client gave consent okay if say rise level structural problems getting earlier saying well doesnt rise level personal jurisdiction say thats really involved merely personal protection i suppose personal protection purpose person give refuse consent long client said fine tried magistrate judge isnt end end well youre saying client never consented could get without giving written consent i mean seems turning whole premise head okay i let give answer okay but youre wrong that state attorney general could done petitioners counsel said would stuck they went trial its like making general appearance if youre wrong i gather would lose would defendants couldnt get end saying sorry never consented couldnt get i think must lose no i think youre answering different objection i said isnt consent sufficient give objection said answer i didnt consent trial sit back wait see happens say oh didnt consent rendering entire thing waste time justice ginsburg says yeah say dont right pull consent sat implicitly consented dont problem would end argument i dont think youve answered well thats another question your answer i consented far i concerned tried i didnt consent give option go entire trial pull rug didnt like result justice ginsburgs suggestion suggestion if find implicit consent part sufficient cant pull rug would end issue far self protection concerned i dont i dont see way around that going another subject no i id okay may i interrupt question if took justice ginsburgs suggestion participation trial enough establish consent would mean consent need given advance beginning proceeding and statutes rather clear come first isnt well dont give consent though magistrate judge sits says lets go and i realize consent failure object theres distinction party sits trial begins but may i ask even authority say lets go consent given no magistrate say words lets go i mean hes got first amendment right if magistrate say everybody sits smile face i would suppose that consent point i mean isnt couldnt infer consent point of course statute says consent communicated clerk theres one dysjunction stressed i think rightly congress it didnt want parties coerced getting magistrate instead article iii judge wanted assure voluntariness two concerns present case i mean nobody suggesting state attorney general coerced didnt voluntarily reasons provision dont exist dont match case well i think could take notice couldnt state attorney generals might want antagonize magistrates theyre going theyre institutional litigants appear time might might reluctant withhold consent unless could anonymous basis provided rules thank ms frost ms eskow 3 minutes

and case go back implied warranty component case defect dealing process followed exactly government commanded contract would create dioxin everyone concedes dioxin extremely hazardous substance dioxin united states used defoliate jungles vietnam expose thousands people injury we could ask yes well dont leverage point i mean ask indemnification say going put express indemnification provision yes course either face civil criminal penalties doesnt seem like good option and recall thompson facts i think compelling facts could possibly given producing kind herbicides they ordered produce mr thompson came defense department begged to told refused make proposal bid particular manufacture the government asks contractor provide cost information build set price youll notice price the united states sets price they set i think would still specifications argument would still superior knowledge argument i agree underlying compulsion forces us table first instance provides strongest argument mind respect implied indemnification no fact in fact justice oconnor court doesnt adopt theory extends beyond combination compulsion compelled specifications superior knowledge combination because three uniquely fit facts particular case under section 707 no well number cases lower courts fact held manner on hand particular case went way its far clear well see theory boyle i mean government argues boyle rendered superfluous provision contract remedy i think thats wrong two counts first i think consistent way court analyzed relationship tort claims contract claims hatzlachh hatzlachh recall case implied bailment agreement also tort claims immunity also right go individual officers order recover court said availability remedy way undermined ability get contract remedy therefore facts case availability remedy boyle shouldnt way deprive us otherwise would valid contract remedy i think logic hatzlachh applies directly i also think importance boyle require right entitled indemnified circumstances means governments exposure liability significantly reduced we win cases government act responsibly recognize role putative indemnitor come defense situations issues arise absolutely justice scalia thats nature unless united states exercises role indemnitor takes defense claim case doesnt lose anything consequence were attempting get government pay us attorneys fees particular litigation were talking attorneys fees damages arising third party litigation kind damages quite common im sorry but point i think reason different government unique relationship contractors they enter special relationship true theres general maxim law deal straight corners contract government theres also rule law says government enters contract private individuals tends assume obligations private individuals we put dont put costs we submit think costs government sets price government free exclude legitimate cost chooses we dont leverage justice ginsburg dealing price term that term set government every term contract set no way term used context existing contract the difference implied law contract subject tucker act one like baltimore ohio railroad case government cites provide benefit government without agreement seek reimbursed quantum meruit theory this court federal circuit consistently held thats implied law contract tucker act sort excuse waiver with respect situation existing agreement imply terms agreement based relationship parties i oh right argument ordinary contract principles involving indemnification underlying assumption is party control indemnify party innocent exposed particular injury well i seen government persuasive argument anything nature relationship united states petitioners cause court deviate ordinary rules contract interpretation would and three arguments government put forward interfere tort claims remedies court specifically rejected hatzlachh saying look contract contract issue look torts tort issue contract situation if thats youre looking look ordinary principles federal common law contract law principles seems say compulsion specifications superior knowledge ought indemnification and defect remember compelled make product inherently dangerous thats defect that creates warranty creates another contract right not extraordinary amount experience your honor im sorry right justice breyer i think comes straight indemnification law the rules indemnification say protected if questions id there allegation taking thompson complaint compensated contract theories wouldnt basis saying received compensation yet takings issue underlies thank mr chief justice let begin judge plagers dissenting opinion court law affords substantially justice majority conceded the united states podium today defend court appeals decision causation essentially defend court appeals interpretation defense production act on basis alone ought vacate send back allow us opportunity demonstrate precise contours nature relationship indemnification breach warranty claims think court already acknowledged recognized readily implied ordinary contracts ought applied justice ginsburg i would answer reference justice breyers question said people deal government contracts im one look things like spearin claims helene curtis claims claims truth court ought hold context case hercules thompson claim compulsion specifications superior knowledge combined one it perfectly fair imply within contours contract indemnification i think though court could hold facts ive described assume summary judgment i understand rule law ought one opportunity recover remedy government offers us government contract defense sole opportunity protect revealed plainly case revealed inadequate there gaps it doesnt cover everything situation innocent party controlling party indemnification arrangement government contract contract appropriate course find innocent party indemnified hold government liable under theory law i think applies id ask court reverse send back proceedings thank your honors the honorable court adjurned tomorrow ten oclock,715.0,981,31,well hear argument number 94 818 hercules incorporated v united states mr phillips who cant recover united states i mean i really find simple fairness argument little hard take field i mean theres anybody whos done simple fairness soldiers injured thing cant sue havent abandoned simple fairness field should outraged companies cannot pass liability injured parties cant recover sure companies golden parachutes something else thats different question whether get moneys well established long time mr phillips deals government must turn square corners that matter equity something like matter waiver sovereign immunity always strictly construed mr phillips respect suppose case developed judge pratts acceptance governments contractor defense stuck change district judges entered judgment appeal taken companies concerned court appeals would resolve government contractor defense settle precisely terms us they settle want reimbursed government cost settlement would claim but loss ive described decision uncertainty whether victory district court prevail thats dont want take chance losing appeal theyve district court yet say government would responsible contract but law government contractor complete defense tort action thats law manufacturers say yes urge that law accepted court that law know courts appeals reliable going settle rather risk reversal did allege compelled within meaning section 101 compelled produce stuff why get indemnification defense 707 virtue compulsion i mean leaving aside whatever circumstances might might implied doesnt allegation accepted entitle defense therefore get implying indemnification dont need should excused litigating position in words i dont know ultimately play seems strong argument should excuse carrying issue far go convenience implying indemnification dont bother litigate 707 position well regardless whether call convenience extent going implying find implication find implication allegations defense 707 secondly shouldnt litigate point it may reasonable choose allowing blink expense indemnification fact may necessary may proven necessary even theory pursued defense prefer government well difficulty argument seems proving i accept defense 707 question effect relieved establishing well token i dont know answer request government take part settlement did request government take position well i assume follows position would government would contribute settlement would also logically claim government didnt settle ultimately youd claim government attorneys fees i suppose well goodness i mean even people prosecuted criminally government expend know hundreds thousands dollars defend ultimately found innocent claim indemnification government yes whether reasonable imply term contract government surely colored fact government doesnt even pay prosecuted wrongfully expend hundreds thousands dollars defend would government doesnt pay situation likely entered implied contract pay seems much less heinous situation youre complaining this different government youre talking seems but party government the average party party sovereign immunity terms implied contract government surely ought colored fact government usually doesnt pay people litigating between parties got case spearin line parties immediate contract involved spearin successfully invoked recover money paid third party tort claimants were third party tort claimants well i dont read spearin say law implied warranties indemnity going incorporated bag baggage every deal united states spearin fairly limited case facts mr phillips defense production act work suppose ordered produce could say well well negotiate contract now want indemnity clause contract did option choice and government give i mean work if theyre making something well force proceed anyway just following justice kennedy happens fix price suppose company says dont want produce thing they say how decide price who sets price government did allege excuse would petitioners option enter agreement certainly court would adopt theory would extend beyond compulsion combination right is case sort sport instances lower courts going find companies full defense well under law allows contractors defense third party claims boyle but kind sport regard i mean i would think instances boyle rule would protect contractor circumstances except always pay attorneys fees thats case way present fluke even client wins ought lower courts client claim united states whatever cost defend suits successfully unsuccessfully its fluke this come time whenever suit brought money expended ultimately taken united states pocket thats another result know say quite different ordinarily sort litigation recover attorneys fees government express statutory provision yes look whole picture seems justice scalia says look whole picture youre saying government doesnt indemnify people wrongly prosecuted criminal law you may different theory distinguished fits oddly way government treats lot people could built setting price contract question justice oconnor justice breyer asking youre compelled make contract government could put cost cost insuring potential tort liability in view does argue the theory somehow implied fact concede get want basis upon get going totally divorced concept implied fact well certainly based upon theory assumes fact implicit agreement actually made but general rule taking face plausible case arguing acting compulsion the whatever plausibility may whatever justifiability may general rule i suppose premised assumption two parties capable deciding whether capable deciding whether deal yet premise argument claim option hence raises question plausible implications circumstances imported one is general principle underlies lot experience government contracts certain then maybe cant answer im looking seems things theres superior knowledge claim theres spearman claim that theres case claim theres case claim really example general principle somehow thousands thousands government contracts sometimes silences millions different government contracts arise millions different circumstances courts imply terms dont appear writing theyll take account kinds things including fact government issue what im looking general principle seems thats youre looking you unique circumstances want kind term implied get reimbursement im looking place written case written general principles might lead someone imply term government doesnt cooperate you know things say theres promise pay i one question did ever allege point taking think doesnt arise thank mr phillips mr dumont well hear mr phillips argument court error correction court appeals errors might sympathetic argument terms question granted certiorari law making peculiar case class cases i take it isnt youre asking youd like us hold i take technically youd say question whether fed circuit opportunity ask district court find facts one decide whether but i dont know all right thank mr phillips the case submitted,1135.0,1954,31,thank mr chief justice may please court in view three related reasons petitioners implied warranty claim case fail let touch briefly i think court already touched first judicial implication amounts open ended indemnity third party product liability claims brought years performance completed contract would unreasonable matter straightforward contract interpretation second would unnecessary even petitioners view facts existence government contractor defense tort liability unfairness kind situation third would unwise would permit exactly kind cost shifting government court held would impermissibly undermine governments retention immunity suit exercise discretionary functions now start saying know theres nothing written contracts warranty indemnity running government suppliers in fact thing youll find look contracts warranty running supplier government product would free defects manufacture design leaving aside recognize even petitioners recognize establish contract implied fact contract term implied fact yet weve heard court pointed argument contract implied law argument unfair done argument government compelled certain things i mean push argument extreme eliminate contract entirely argument i wouldnt want comment validity claim they could assert i think claim i two answers 1 i think would much better claim claim raised 2 the context course requiring citizens things time war help government prosecuting war effort now government required lot people go vietnam use agent orange well know only that might prove valid claim it valid resistant valid answer governments ability compel military service forced involuntary servitude it necessarily taking property government contract commercially reasonable terms produce product normal price now remember excuse remember products companies produced commercial market agent orange magical thing thompson regard different different hercules thats true quite sir well extent i understand well im sure i sort let try direct answer one notion wouldnt reasonable interpret contract light surrounding circumstances well i think answer course one interprets contract light surrounding circumstances a contract implied fact one taken courts views right believes parties might reasonably either agree course contract words might reasonably agreed theres obviously gray area there cases one contemplation particular situation now get government contract whatever rule would case ordinary contract private parties get government contract particular reasons believing government would agreed thing kind indemnity petitioners seeking first theres anti deficiency act congress made clear 180 years want government officials government officers entering obligations behalf congress open ended liability go beyond current appropriations stick united states huge uncertain bills there definitely gray area it could well issue raised spearin if court would like revisit spearin basis i think might good idea answer lower courts tried say look theres difference breach contract officer authority enter contract talking breach damages relatively reasonably bounded original contract original appropriation theres difference open ended sort indemnity provision thats line federal circuit drawn course court primarily charged claims court courts primarily charged making sense area now thing i would point government congress decides wants give indemnities specifically great care 50 us code section 1431 provides indemnities exactly kind situations talking defense contracts gives secretary defense president broad authority enter contracts without regard normal terms like anti deficiency act requires procedures now petitioners never asked those procedures werent complied they dont even allege indemnity provision well wasnt thats 50 us code section 1431 thank and discussed length brief page 40 footnote 23 there another provision i could go theres another provision one cited brief 10 us code section 2354 happens to military rd contracts if look one youll see kind careful structure it looks like indemnity talks like indemnity congress put specifically now government impliedly agree indemnify people open ended liabilities now another reason i think goes back point interpreting contract government think government might mind case government would mind immune tort liability injuries allegedly arise exercise discretionary functions now court made clear boyle discretionary function exemption tort law covers design decisions military equipment now saying hatzlachh that precludes court reading contract include indemnity warranty provision strongly suggests us government would wanted enter sub silentio warranty provision would completely vitiated important immunity no dont now i want clear i dont believe weve conceded either points that mentioned i mean position although argument 707 raised shield would certainly vastly stronger argument one theyve raised rejected three courts considered consider right answer i understand thats theyre trying now i must say i agree implication question i believe justice souter anything existence shield provision defense production act shows congress thought issue resolved giving contractors shield whatever scope turns therefore even less reason think authorized contracting officers enter broad indemnities would simply get rid reason shield provision first place why bother invoke theyve got indemnity government now point petitioners counsel keeps talking law indemnity though perfectly clear contract private parties indemnity would implied im sure that correct established but event look circumstances government provides warranties theres executive order 50 us code 1431 i mentioned goes great detail indemnities thats one place find look like indemnity clause sophisticated private contract that give give explicit indemnity give indemnitor sorts rights participate defense control defense now course wasnt anything like now say asked us participate settlement thats fine asked us liability that position beginning liable effectively stood apart rest litigation settled we participate settlement thought liability i find unremarkable i dont know implied inferred that made sort contractual commitment pay whatever decided settle i would thought rather reverse if thought hook wed ever thought hook course would involved settlement i think i understand argument i believe argument put argument unfairness i believe argument cognizable no absolutely question got court participated boyle an indemnitor normally knows hook therefore takes defense thats remarkable but question indemnitor the question indemnitor petitioners sometimes seem lose sight submission look way government contracts always interpreted way government indemnities always given congress considered find basis infer government would agreed term now i think also look want get back authorities look spearin look cases preceded spearin well another brooklyn navy yard case that navy yard caused lot problems there excavation case borings misrepresented governments specifications theres dam case going construct dam government specifications said backed soft material turned boulders rocks theres stagecoach case mail delivery new york thats supreme court case im talking supreme court cases cases court dealt fact case justice brandeis cited said okay apply term spearin contract case called kellogg implied warranty case bridge builder built foundations bridge turned new contractor well turned foundations werent correctly done court said well fine matter standard contract law infer built foundations turned purpose building bridge top warranting correctly made well theres nothing remarkable just filed brief saying government contractor defense recognized i assume could i assume could we involved case course sued us tried implead us indemnity contribution course aspect case well im sure aside volunteering cover losses i dont know else i think would without special without special appropriation thats correct i dont know would happened tried invoke executive order provides indemnities kinds circumstances i dont know whether would granted far i know never asked well im saying time contract come said going wed like contract course first went hercules said wed like bids bid competitively get contracts dont forget but thompsons case went said wed like make they said really dont want we said well really want going invoke authority now negotiate price term they came back us said cant make money price said willing pay us adjusted if come back us said concerned cant get insurance weve gone market whatever might said need indemnity california courts strange things tort law dont know whats going happen products liability i dont know government would said far i know never made request thats right its completely clear costplus contracts government recognize prices in fixed cost contracts im intimately familiar prices fixed understanding thats legitimate item overhead your normal products liability insurance litigation expenses insurance part price if say well charge price market stuff need get insurance think costs going i dont see reason wouldnt taken account now possible possible i suppose government could adopted entirely unreasonable position said want make stuff us 5 barrel costs 50 i dont know answer would facts except government starts ordering things very far away contracts begin implied facts contracts if government perfidious last thing going start impliedly warranting going hold harmless liability now court might choose try impose sort liability would i think quite clearly policy decision impose liability circumstances i believe position authority compel performance theres series safeguards i believe regulations youre supposed go people make normally cant find go somebody else kind thing ultimately bottom line yes authority to now weve talked unreasonable regular contract matter imply youve talked little bit colloquys colleague developed little bit unnecessary there government contractor defense fact provide contractor in petitioners situation petitioners allege defense tort liability fact left holding bag court concerned overall fairness legal framework i think real warrant concern precisely defense thats right our position thats position weve taken it certainly provides may penumbral scope i think fundamental position look carefully congress mind theres indication mind giving complete hold harmless well certainly hold harmless complete shield kind liability might come after well i dont want pretermit inquiry scope section 707 shield provision general position our general position 707 well certainly falls passers prevented government government contractor defense turns specific thing way told make and and criteria met insulated liability insulated liability cant sued first place thats ground tort liability comes within discretionary function exemption now i think points im sorry well i think points fundamental difference government contractor defense petitioners theory sensible way resolving problem government contractor defense circumstances prevents liability part manufacturer really something governments responsibility also saves government immunity suit neither party liable loss lies falls result tort immunity now petitioners theory contrary get direct pass the passer recover manufacturer manufacturer recovers government government manufacturer protected public policy underpinnings government contractor defense vitiated government ends paying substantive liability justice scalia pointed circumstances attorneys fees defense tort action i think thats probably right we ave not terms our position theyre simply separate inquiries 707 provides shield scope actions taken compulsion dpa now we think thats right there need provision difference fact i think probably right say thats right the absence gap filler would reason inferring indemnity part government contract there may the government contractor defense would presumably cover things it may thats correct thats correct right well i think weve really covered basic heads its important understand sequence judge pratt rendered summary judgment he withheld final judgment order give defendants benefit certifying class entered as turned relinquished control case judge weinstein took simply revoked prior summary judgment now far i understand question availability defense questioned whether could established without trial revoked summary judgment now eventually parties settled that case went away now judge weinstein time understand revoked summary judgment granted government grounds feres discretionary function exception bringing everyone back saying im going send trial going find happened well sort legal issues trial now settlement litigation effectively opt litigation people opted class brought proceedings continuing proceedings behest manufacturers including thompson hercules judge weinstein also went back ruling third party liability claim certain people servicemen relatives servicemen so context filed motion saying listen talking group plaintiffs youre telling us government immune matter tort law theres reason government contractor defense youve kicked props government contractor defense rests and youre going to us seems like shouldnt government contractor defense thats section 1 submission now section 2 submission several reasons joint appendix i commend several reasons might factual issues applicability government contractor defense court action either judge pratt judge weinstein second circuit ever suggested doubt availability government contractor defense established factual prerequisites application i think thats quite important just sum think unreasonable matter contract law think government would agreed kind indemnity it unnecessary feres justification required existence government contractor defense perhaps section 707 would quite unwise would gut governments immunities way court specifically rejected interpreting government contractor defense thank you,594.0,847,25,let ask suppose win thompson assert valid takings claim the company compelled objection produce substance government it choice well logical reason occur wouldnt prevail claim i dont see whether valid takings claim i mean government compelled they lost company everything yes and thompson given production they producing they compelled produce government order are finished okay if city council passed regulation made house owner put kind paint something garage said i dont want i dont want it everybody sues house owner wouldnt court sort strain interpretation said oh house owner pay whole thing city councils free things it incurred tremendous liability theyll take house away wouldnt least look see statute couldnt interpreted differently the answers yes right okay then question i mean sort set laughter the question wouldnt federal circuit court claims everybody else involved interpreting contracts also try interpret contract way suggests government try stick person unfair result and thats way i dont know whether falls spearman category ex cello category category least wouldnt interpret government contract normally open suggest way reading contract stop people go takings clause order prevent kind tremendously unfair result even unique therefore thats shouldnt send back see thing see facts warrant it seems issue took basically conceded error i mean questions but stop isnt argument implied terms government contracts its gray area i mean argument proves much much it means cannot implied terms what provision youre relying mr dumont but i take basic point lower courts yes yes thats quite right see trying look implied term reimburse us implied fact argue government superior knowledge danger we look indemnity contracts tell indemnitors normally liable wont take lawsuit force person go litigate though could come run way think run look policy look policy 707 put things together see theres kind implied term im looking favorably i dont see lower courts court like fed circuit ever passed i dont see facts record would permit pass thats im back thinking indeed fed circuit said footnote 8 hinted footnote footnote 8 thing 707 discussion seemed turn errors law seem ready admit errors law that problem causation problem 707 limited prioritization contract im positive admit see im trying get dont send whole thing back think errors law all right i dont mean shield theyre looking policy order decide whether among reasons implied fact the reason would obviously think tremendously good defense called government contractor defense instead helping make theyre defendants hundreds companies whole companies stake 40 billion instead saying judge judge think theyre right instead i guess silent maybe said judge i think theyre wrong i dont know exactly happened think thats unfair context whole contract put understand argument well government ordinarily come contractor raising government contractor defense every court might raise say support defense an indemnitor but indemnitors normally theyre given opportunity its normal thing isnt and youve left case fact product caused explosion is position i take governments position high official government say attorney general looked litigation said terribly unfair thompson hercules go help would really would told attorney general look discretion authority would discretion alleviate hercules concern hercules plight that would far could go opinion right but view could done supported government contractor defense would authority well position thing could done didnt file helpful brief and i i take candidly answered question could manufacturers negotiated provision said defendant indemnify answer says yes could asked wouldnt given and the question time contract but government could said wont give term still contract law says compel what said okay going put price cost us insure potential tort liability you concede i take court wrong limiting governments authority compel 101 merely compel priority performance opposed performance period yes what interpretation im sorry 707 you agree first 2071a says government say mr smith mr smith must produce agent orange right and says person shall held liable damages resulting indirectly compliance directly indirectly meant insulate contractor damages flow agent orange unreasonably dangerous something like in words position means immunity gives immunity person different contract producer saying shouldnt bumped governments contract ahead mine nothing so fact government ordered person produce something explosive blew factory hurt passers government would would liable government wouldnt liable is view but youre saying government contractor defense makes unnecessary basically all right government contractor defense view theres explosion government specifications means contractor cannot recover government passers injured yes yes superior knowledge yes i guess i wasnt paying attention moment ago youre saying defense 707 narrower scope compulsion 101 slack made difference made government contractor defense combine 707 government contractor defense complete defense whatever compelled 101 position no position would explain i guess im but everything compelled subject shield okay now difference there need sense tough world thats way goes okay but least partial gapfiller right thats government contractor defense but may complete gapfiller and one reason is conditions applying 707 conditions government contractor defense you might okay now well never mind about government contractor defense would please remind played judge pratt said i accept defense proceedings judge weinstein i understand government didnt simply stand aside argued affirmatively government contractor defense thank mr dumont mr phillips 3 minutes

case involves two questions taking order ninth circuit addressed look first whether complaint contained sufficient facts support cause action nonsignatory international union engages companywide strike violates nostrike clause contract local employer this strike higher wages better benefits strike amendment contract would provide immunity international locals regard past wrongdoing the it tort action structured inducement interference it grounded contract specifically would look for jurisdiction your honor 301a provides jurisdiction theres suit breach  theres suit violation contract nonparty party contract union employer mr chief justice concept advancing plain language statute violation contract right heart suit you 150 years jurisprudence enforcing contracts central mission statute i cant imagine would you might different kind tort thats  thats cognizable thats certainly what looking minor adjustment would otherwise straightforward contract action situation international displaced local contract entered took control control manifested several specific points within complaint and another way  effectively agency relationship  point international local agency relationship control effect breach we originally look agency claim the problem agency claim time contract formed clear local operating behalf international it the question decide whether theres cause action your honor argument really isnt new with regard it briefs it directly briefs with regard footnote actually say we take position contract within protection contract in words party position control one signatories contract cause signatory breach contract  every regard equivalent violation contract they responsible party they  your honor your honor essence section 301 deal midterm contract strikes your honor described terms impact labor relations exactly focused this party this international effectively displaces takes control tells employer independent ability resolve dispute we originally made argument  moving party undisclosed principal actually caused contract come existence we cant factually support they upset decision enter contract we abandoned regard formation we absolutely abandon argument thereafter breach thereafter happened international taking control local causing local breach contract and differentiates many many circumstances third parties this court would your honor due respect i think cause action would clearly preempted allischalmers subsequent decisions in allischalmers court address preemption doctrine indicated would extend torts no your honor i think youre correct thats correct your honor your honor taken strong position preempted 301 it involve interpretation contract application contract to view otherwise preempted would start attacking 301 terms uniform national system administering contracts federal labor law the issue would whether action engaging strike violates nostrike clause collective bargaining agreement i think dispute i think theres dispute underlying existence contract  nostrike clause complex thats correct your honor yes that order appealed ninth circuit ninth circuit affirmed from perspective final determination july 2nd starting date contract however still formation issue we thats position we succeeded issue ninth circuit we agree that would go arbitration scheduled go arbitration local company the second question brought play particular case whether formation question goes arbitrator goes your honor your honor critical issue isnt nlrb ruling although thats going to drawn upon there denial contract formed july 2nd continues today and question where get decided does get decided court unanimous jury verdict or get vacated sent arbitrator agreement youre  justice ginsburg right center analysis contend company formation july 2nd the side contends something happened august 22nd would constitute formation event there  contract its critical importance contract formed theres quid pro quo labor law thats critical agree arbitration exchange nostrike clause that happened 2nd if had formation july 2nd first formation 22nd august would denied benefit contract we never would made deal mr chief justice theres critical issue labor relations clearly ratified brings effect nostrike clause thats embedded the well would  would completely imprudent us say may nostrike clause effect it wasnt parties still labor dispute negotiating july 2nd thats nostrike clause came effect your honor whats really central fact signed december signed agreement july 2nd that critical if ratification july 2nd would contract and union signed take position signed contract ratified august 22nd those radically different events  real issue determine core initial issue yes justice breyer second contract contract proposed side never would clause much money would absorb strike we signed contract assumption contract entered july 2nd thats correct justice alito thats exactly right we agree it wasnt i mean crystalclear understanding parties time ratification time nostrike clause came effect ratification july 2nd wouldnt signed contract wage levels described december when signed signed assumption contract formed july 2nd and issue formation never given arbitration the arbitration clause particular case arises contract its much narrower clause court seen cases submitted justice sotomayor take position much like youve indicated hypothetical actual description nlrb decision definitive but body entity actually adjudicates whether preclusive question does go court already unanimous jury verdict finding ratified go arbitrator looks nlrb decision says i guess i bound we never agreed submit formation question arbitration there clear unmistakable agreement consequently forum issue thats decided we couldnt agree futile act in words contract final starts july 2nd go right issue whether theres breach contract but theres interim step dont yet agreement side that issue moot resolved there would justice ginsburg theres question parties could agree formation arbitrated clear unmistakable way the problem  agree  clause  clause included formation issue would go arbitrator but issue becomes contract and thats threshold issue bring life agreement get subject matter jurisdiction if your honor lets say 4 years later entered new contract willingly getting exchange nostrike clause arbitration new contract said going deal past disputes including prior contracts fine when executed contract december executed contract believed formed july there meeting minds in words unions execution contract say formed 22nd there major major issue july 2nd made concessions wages working conditions rest explicit understanding would ratified time stipulated fact number 16 i think joint appendix 377 qualification if wasnt ratified july 2nd happened withdrawn exploded nothing nothing signed december we signed agreed july 2nd maintained position believe got benefit protection nostrike clause way time period and critical distinction and i couldnt agree court academic exercise go either arbitrator court whether effect july 2nd we believe nlrb decision preclusive regard but underneath forum there somebody say if arbitrator got case looked said well im sure i really agree nlrb i think im going decide differently went review court arbitrator made mistake law mistake fact completely clear would able come back court get effectively changed we saying issue formation submitted court litigated and i would like much chief justice reserve rest time rebuttal categorically your honor nlrb jurisdiction case in footnote 18 reply brief recount history that paperworkers case referenced international signatory it exclusive bargaining representative therefore status section 8b3 its footnote 18 reply brief recount history litigated ninth circuit beyond there remedy nlrb justice breyer fundamental aspect thats right conduct involved causing violation contract the international took control local forced breach this  conduct would never sanctioned jurisdiction nlrb access  wisely i think structure national labor relations board  8b3 remedy exclusive agent they bargaining agent international bargaining agent and consequently accepted position international would create nomans zone would apply throughout country whereby collective bargaining agreements entered locals could destroyed violated international would choose impose local cause happen most internationals responsible your  your honor i think wellestablished unfair labor practice dont jurisdiction section 8b3 what suggested maybe nomans zone congress go regulate back 1947 passage section 301 inconceivable passing statute congress intended leave international unions anybody controlled party completely free reach law well exclusive representative in words 8b3 contemplates bargaining obligation part exclusive representative international capacity they control arent designated manner theres one nlrb case history agency deviates would immediately and isnt so looking options state court appeared clearly preempted allis  chalmers row cases so meant federal law section 301 suggested lincoln mills would absorb please recognize seeking  labels tort contract create i think false distinction we effectively bringing contract action violation contract the linkage strictly add international acting party,824.0,1195,50,well hear argument next morning case 081214 granite rock company v international brotherhood teamsters mr mathiason its tort action right i suppose  grounded contract i suppose existence contract evidentiary matter establish cause action still tort course 301a limited violations contracts i dont see somebody party contract violate contract they liable sorts things i dont see liable violating contract i suppose tortious interference contract can without  establishing existence contract yes i suppose thats tortious interference  ability enter contract i think recognized jurisdictions well could sued agency claim couldnt well i mean  youre coming saying well principalagent i could understand thats i didnt think question decide on  tortious interference whether thats 301 sure agentprincipal i understand but  thats new argument far im concerned is briefs is part question well  basic question  chief justice began  isnt  isnt tort action you say well grounded contract i  i really problem word grounded if say necessarily implicates entangled i could understand but grounded contract  ask source original obligation and parties  international part  part  part contract so suddenly lot things would preempted go board for example labor dispute construction business one unions telling keep going and group comes says dont let and another says you dont contract and 19 unions fighting  everybody going end suing federal court i thought purpose lmra stop the purpose labor act wagner act stop they didnt want federal courts state courts interfering kind thing so read exception it would reproduce situation led congresses presidents 1930s stop yes thats right said heres well deal well deal giving employer union right go court enforce contract get damages violation that figure furthers labor relations but pretty hard see could labor relations letting third party sun come say everything went labor dispute  tort respect contract might even signed yet you arguing us creating federal common law tortious interference you saying theyre actual party contract so theory  arguing so youve given agency argument well seems strongest argument tortious interference preempted state law so  vacuum dont accept  accept view let ask my understanding  correct i wrong please  court said  state law cause action interference contract relations preempted this court said am i correct the circuits said havent said am i right no im talking  im talking specifically  interference advantageous business relations interfering existing contract  addressed court but   include interference  contractual relation we specific holding  tell im wrong i look allischalmers allischalmers involved two parties contract tort claim one party contract party contract right and involves tort claim one party contract third party it seems quite  quite different allischalmers it  would seem one strongest points pre empted state law if  thats true would deciding case based premise  unclear well  contractual issue what issue interpreting contract case presents let 301 case go forward is dispute how issue still alive wasnt nlrb order may 06 said  directed contract become effective july 2nd did anybody appeal order challenge so   lost appeal ninth circuit contract effective july 2nd issue remains anybody decide respect contract formation because final adjudication question effective date contract so question appears extant mind whether breach nostrike clause so isnt subject arbitration terms arbitration clause yes  doubt formation justice sotomayor said there contract contract signed december 17th it formed you dont doubt formed they dont doubt formed and contract arbitration agreement and one questions arbitrated i take whether december 17th contract retroactivity provisions provides damages happened july and part require arbitrator interpret december 17th contract decide whether cover event july 2nd now got  i mean i would thought  thati mean argument but  anything question formation given contract the contract retroactive may contract retroactive may certainly contract formed issue  academic but matter why matter contract a contract formed everybody agrees and everybody agrees effective date may so isnt i suppose question friends side whether think ratification contract entered december thats effective may  makes liable violating nostrike clause right so happens ratified retroactively is nostrike clause effect you want say yes right i think people communicating imagine december 17th i enter contract written red right and one red sentences says i pay 32 extra hour moment blue contract went effect see now whether  moment blue contract went effect question isnt would turn arbitrator person arbitrating meaning application red contract thats simply question fact contractual meaning like now i said thats wrong why difficult issue i easily modify hypothetical the red contract says joe smith paid 32 extra hour moment red contract takes effect okay and issue everybodys agreed well send meaning contract arbitration well send application contract  arbitration one questions when purposes 32 contract admittedly signed take effect why isnt question arbitrator is authority anywhere says isnt  i cant  i cant even know authoritywhat reasoning would am i correct neither neither granite rock local thinks december collective bargaining agreement really fully retroactive they dont think it meant nostrike clause effect day old collective bargaining agreement expired dont think new arbitration clause effect day old collective bargaining agreement expired i understand positions but i keep going back that issue decided it decided nlrb affirmed court law  ninth circuit i dont understand extant issue the   whats left applying arbitration question effectiveness nostrike clause but nothing whether issue ratification decided if contract read simply claims arising contract addition said including formation breach thereof   arbitration clause included formation would argument it would go arbitrator i thought another way putting i hard time you i could couldnt we could try enter contract may 1 knows happens disagree happened way arbitration clause now whether  since disagree would go judge whether formed contract arbitration clause everythings air a year later enter another contract contract says going arbitrate every dispute us including old dispute whether old contract okay and could would  would certainly arbitrate issue contract formation even old one said would right okay so isnt december 17th contract second contract respect july 2nd thank counsel mr bonsall im sorry where footnote 18 well may might  youd remedy state court i think argument  anyway i argument 301 doesnt preempt anything contract claim now go bring claim state court you might good claim state court isnt preempted suppose one employees hit somebody head youd great claim isnt going preempted now might set tort actions state court labor acts preempt particular involve conduct arguably protected arguably forbidden labor acts so fall outside category preempted and fall inside category preempted 301 labor law gave kind decision labor board make what  argument sensible is right what think do seriously think becomes problem nlrb wont declare unfair labor practice dont wont go congress say there nomans land give remedy like 301 youre  youre begging justice breyers question if law preempts claim unjustly make determination should state court federal court first instance nlrb says isnt unfair labor practice rules law doesnt cover authorized issue why  isnt 8b3 how 8b3 read what 8b3 would exclude labor boards thank counsel the case submitted,1213.0,1673,26,mr chief justice may please court id like turn questions raised this question whether contract dated july 2nd question whether contract dated august 22nd those issues contract ratification there one collective bargaining agreement that collective bargaining agreement attached exhibit employers first amended complaint the trial court recognized fact joint appendix page 231 the contract attached  complaint lodging breach contract labor organization there doubt that collective bargaining agreement says first page last page effective date may 1st 2004 expiration date april 30th 2008 the issue your  mr chief justice would whether parties entered agreement made entire agreement retroactive may 1st 2004 whether parties intended retroactivity clause would apply purposes disputes arising parties for example well we contend would heres reason if well i think important two reasons first factually court places position parties july 1st point time things clear the union members strike approximately 3 weeks engaged tough negotiations bargaining table trying reach new contract old contract expired almost 2 months ago and parties reach tentative agreement wages hours terms conditions employment but parties also incorporate retroactivity clause make sure rights benefits would inure union members beginning may 1 day last contract expired the court ask  union members engaging lawful protected concerted activity strike july 1 intend convert lawful economic activity breach contract excuse your honor no i think on july 2nd counsel indicated real dispute continuing dispute parties whether contract ratified july 2nd we think  one contract your honor that contract executed december 14th managements representative december 17th unions representative thats labor agreement now well fact counsel reiterated question contract formation  fact formation issue court asked decide whether arbitral issue the court needs look collective bargaining agreement contract effect time party  union  made demand arbitration clearly indicated contract place contained   excuse  extremely broad arbitration provision requires disputes  disputes arising collective bargaining agreement would subject grievance arbitration provision that correct your honor on july 26th 2004 union confronting boys markets injunction sought employer the issue trial court whether union enjoined strike enjoined and counsel union took clear position contract place time july 26th even injunction issue courts decision buffalo forge the matter continuing issue conflict arise collective bargaining agreement involved labor organizations essentially backtowork agreement so july 26th union take position contract reason injunction appropriate buffalo forge i dont know addresses no there question arbitrating anything the employer didnt ask arbitration july 26th hearing the question point time whether ratification the employer insisted unions representative made communication employers representative contract ratified having witnesses labor management courtroom judge ware said well ill take evidence regarding whether communication occurred did george netto represent bruce woolpert fact contract ratified that narrow issue decided we think theres still issue sent arbitrator breach contract damages precursor contend issue never litigated trial court whether formation question formation time it question contract ratification issue falls within scope broad arbitration provision collective bargaining agreement when go back correct yes uhhuh absolutely correct your honor the employer alleging breach nostrike clause the union alleging defense allegation asserting meritsbased issue regarding whether certain narrow gap period falling effective date contract thats thats exactly correct your honor and yes he thats correct your honor we expect arbitrator take look facts existed july 2nd make determination whether fact point time union meritorious claim contract ratified therefore nostrike clause absolutely both parties openly negotiated hammered representatives sign collective bargaining agreement the employer entirely free inclined suggest would sign agreement unless union consented no the arbitrator would deciding contract formation the arbitrator would deciding within scope collective bargaining agreement whether nostrike clause effective bind employer  excuse  bind union short period time july 2nd august 22nd that would real claim union actually  theres question  strike this dispute what trial court case usurp function arbitrator the parties selected one arbitrator yes yes i  i think court addressed issue justice ginsburg drake bakeries an employer confronted strike the employer immediately went federal court filed breach contract action labor organization insisted two contract provisions right  nostrike clause grievance procedure inextricably tied and court pointed circumstances exact counterweights when signed agreement your honor absolutely get benefit there strike august 22nd violation collective bargaining agreement absolutely if subsequent strike time there your honor after  im sure i understand question the  i think arbitrator there absolutely strike it began early weeks june and continued actually september 22nd 2004 that duration union strike yes thats correct our defense allegation nostrike clause arbitrator would time parties ratified agreement ratification occur august 22nd also appears concession employer paragraph 27 third amended complaint they also say contract ratified august 22nd or august 22nd yes your honor then i think thats correct your honor if i may finish in substance contract formation place back time july 2nd august 22nd it moot entirely academic parties ratify agreement point time sign contract december there question contract formation case theres question contract ratification narrow period under drake bakeries believe severing we think employer brings breach contract claim federal court collective bargaining agreement contains broad arbitration clause remedy seek breach contract damage claim arbitrator thank thank mr chief justice may please court there three basic points i would like discuss court morning regard section 301 issue the first view issue whether tort claim brought 301 begins ends clear language section 301 talks suits violation contract the second point id like make allowing tort action granite rock urging would work big change structure congress established decided major issues labor law weapons  economic weapons parties use decided congress statute national labor relations board application statute thats course issue case never attempted the law circuits case involves interpretation contract preempted im sure court yes no i believe happened no i believe let first clarify something preemption state torts dependent section 301 state torts interference contract would preempted prior garmon machinists preemption two doctrines would interfere conduct arguably prohibited arguably protected area unregulated congress but doesnt leave employer remediless situation like far this employer breach contract action contract pursuing not international thats correct no i disagree there avenue granite rock could pursued pursue filed charge international national labor relations board body making precise decision whether action international economic weapon permissible outlawed national labor relations act granite rock chose file unfair labor practice could and cited  cited actually amicus brief aflcio paperworkers case demonstrates international union interferes bargaining local unions guilty unfair labor practice im  im sorry  im sure i understand question let  let try answer question im  im understanding first issue whether could bring 301 action  tort action 301 preempted 301 the question whether 301 allows type claim whether congress intended i think language statute violation contract indicates violation contract violate contract  bring action someone not federal court claim 301 a state claim state tort action 301 would preempted what happen  similar happened thein rawson case what happens state court tort brought it would preempted complete preemption involves contract interpretation contract that doesnt mean  gone what federal court look claim say pled complaint fall within parameters 301 and thats exactly court rawson it said state court tort action preempted now look see claim 301 yes wed exactly position yes would get you would get result process exactly it   tortious interference cannot  cannot bring claim i saying doesnt leave remediless even regard claim international charge could filed 8b3 board would decide  conduct context board always looking context something prohibited something protected something unregulated and board congress entrusted  job i  i think perhaps saying thing let try i think i understand i confused i think 301 tort action would preempted either doctrines garmon preemption machinists preemption in  state court no  well would  would preempted federal court also it would within primary jurisdiction national labor relations board thats  goes what i think happened justice breyer since enactment 301 particularly courts doctrine complete preemption removal purposes i know theres debate courts look state law torts tend look 301 rather going back garmon machinists preemption yes it would first ceaseanddesist order and makewhole remedy yes yes it would proof damages resulted unfair labor practice unfair conduct situation would interference bargaining process and nlrb would decide damages would international opposed local union im really sure certainly capacity nlra makewhole remedy because congress  congress 301 create limited jurisdiction one type claim one type claim violation contract breach contract action party obligations but doesnt mean isnt claim outside 301 third party in case third party international claim could made national labor relations act the paperworker case example the preemption  well case well end preempting state law tort in case no preempts exactly purpose issue decided regulatory agency congress entrusted making exactly decisions what economic weapons international union parent employer use labor dispute for courts getting involved would directly contrary congress since 1935 saying decisions economic weapons decided courts applying common law tort principles we tried didnt like its  well claim brought federal court preempted it claim you looked claim you read complaint said dont claim 301 one violation contract goodbye end the question justice kennedy  addressing does leave without remedy and answer doesnt aside remedies local also potential remedy international national labor relations act and  basic point i making the paperworkers case cite  answer question im aware case the one cited international party case however clear fact party case determinative factor nlrb instruct international union strike pooled voting provision constitution so didnt say its good case party contract they said you cant situation that clearly showed  nlrb focusing broader type interference didnt party contract but even nlrb  i want stress  find wasnt remedy  facts particular case would simply mean protected conduct national labor relations act and nlrb made decision agency rather courts get involved area law making rules talk interference know tort isnt interference improper interference as associated general contractors indicates would call play courts looking various factors societal values thats exactly congress didnt intend thank you,700.0,971,43,so contract beginning may 22nd included nostrike clause so  dont think  i guess following justice alitos question you dont think included nostrike clause  would apply july 2nd well doesnt  im sorry interrupt but doesnt include nostrike clause question whether july 2nd one talk december agreement retroactive may really kind beside point and say say  say arbitration clause intended retroactive but say arbitration clause  later  agreement ratified december retroactive neither one retroactive no i understand ive difficulty  put december  view sides put december agreement aside it nothing argument thats us the argument us  whether ratification july 2nd well  im sorry thats central issue your friend says contract july 2nd thats court determine arbitrator question formation i thought unions initial position agreement refused arbitrate isnt  wasnt unions refusal arbitrate precipitated case i thought time union refused arbitrate but least nlrbs  nlrb weighed said contract july 2nd isnt conclusive i thought answered justice alito i thought question simple one youre taking position i think theres dispute  december contract formed it made retroactive date july it started may covers time frame the dispute parties retroactivity contract means provisions effect isnt argument  contract formation question  applicability individual provisions set facts so answer justice alito we arguing nostrike clause effect take position arbitration clause made retroactive and expect arbitrator the arbitrator  since agree theres contract effect arbitrator going decide whether contract and contract nostrike clause so expect arbitrator say get benefit contract lets decide something even though theres nostrike clause contract want arbitrator say nostrike clause operative july 2nd even though  im sorry interrupt but even though later agreement would retroactive so substance  think arbitrator would decide issue contract formation whether well i thought said arbitrator would decide whether agreement july 2nd well perhaps clarify one thing i thought two go together  two things go together one nostrike clause one arbitration clause and trying uncouple even though one quid pro quo would say union wants keep favors arbitration clause reject favors employer nostrike clause it seems one cant say oh yes arbitration clause dont nostrike clause well theyre circumstances respond opponents argument why world would signed  july 2nd didnt think going get benefit nostrike clause if benefit nostrike clause subsequent strike would violated contract well subsequent strike is issue arbitrator now know agreement july 2nd question whether strike continued arbitrator well say strike i  i thought side said right right position contract july 2nd included nostrike clause violated okay and answer one contract right but would issue  think that would issue arbitrator decide whether contract ratified july 2nd and arbitrator thought existence july 2nd would lose so thats issue contract formation in substance oh sure and  position depends upon answer justice ginsburgs question severing arbitration nostrike obligation thank counsel mr nussbaum do take position cause action interference contract preempted insofar state law concerned what position point do   client take position that law correct federal law preempted state law actions interference  contract relations all right so submitting court purpose national relation  labor relations act effect give immunity unions intentional interference contractual relations well isnt effect argument not international if true  true take purposes  current purpose international really induce local continue strike said theres action state court thats preempted unfair labor practice proceedings local  international so theres nothing it view  said well theres relief local theres remedy international even allegation true strike would never occurred hadnt pressure international counsel id like broader perspective representative international i think important issue labor policy if i think cause actions available 301a preemptive effect 301a ought coextensive  prefer broader 301a narrower preemption i think makes difference i think 301  i think whatever  i dont think nomans land bring action 301 preempted 301 in words  right cannot bring tortious interference action 301 i dont think preempted if wrong bring i understand preempted so preempted 301 cannot bring 301 right and granite rock brought claim state court would say preempted 301 and turned around brought federal court 301 would say cause action 301 okay so nomans land their claim tortious interference contract cant brought anywhere they could always go nlrb what remedies  im sorry what remedy just finish chief right  im quite clear preemption works i perhaps didnt right but imagine 301 never enacted i thought never enacted certain kinds state claims particularly tort claims interference labor contracts example might preempted anyway labor relations   lmra i thought basic preemptive job and preempted lmra 301 creates exception preemption isnt preempted suit now thinking probably outofdate wrong i would like explain works no i think response chief justices question i became uncertain lmra  lmra preempts tort actions state activities interfere labor relations might it rather section 301 preempts it odd preempts it says wont give  thats i became uncertain in state court federal court but bring federal court may i ask remedy unfair labor practice can get damage remedy right a makewhole remedy  okay what would makewhole  i gather ceaseanddesist wouldnt make sense would makewhole remedy entail so  saying theres cause action tort claim nonetheless say tort claim considered unfair labor practice labor board why make sense but outside 301 preemption come garmon if i could interrupt moment allischalmers 301 allischalmers says 301 covers contract therefore theres preemption so i take youre talking allischalmers preemption you talking garmon machinists something but say back started if 301 preempts within ambit 301s jurisdiction federal court well applies 301 theyre touching contract theyre touching parties contract this outside contract so preempted i understand has  board fact declared party party labor contract guilty unfair labor practice prior cases thank counsel mr mathiason 5

Corson, Deceased, et al.","Railroad Friction Products Corporation, et al.",6.0,3.0,0,761.0,1066,14,thank mr chief justice may please court congress enacted locomotive inspection act ensure safety locomotives use railroad lines regulate hazards mechanics conducting repairs locomotives the doctrine implied that actually i think pursuant safety appliance act justice sotomayor im  im mistaken and principle behind safety use regulation court construed napier ensure locomotives safe fit use line and consistent construction iccs statement made 1922 courts postnapier yes our position pursuant locomotive inspection act icc promulgated rule as court said numerous cases icc rules place respect different aspects train different points time locomotive inspection act designed address specific problem boilers exploding line train operation and consistent way icc subsequently federal railroad administration construed act im sorry well course ray addressed port tanker safety act well port waterway safety act in united states v locke case court subsequently looked ray terms design statute also specifically included word repair maintenance absent but court getting ray ensure states using law interfere design equipment of course no if i could make two points justice sotomayor thats actually correct the first anything court might think design impair failureto warrant claims entail challenge design locomotive instructions safe use but extent no my second argument design claim involves repair work problems uniquely include intrude fitness service standard court announced napier consistently applied the asbestos harms repair workers faced unique repair process scraping yes yes mr chief justice also says page 612 power delegated congress determine fitness service so words no doesnt but mr chief justice principle ensure locomotives outside repair yard locomotive  railroad line   safe operate that standard napier issue not broken but point broken and locomotive repair workers face unique hazards repairing locomotives whose safety standards ensure work properly rail roadway taken apart repaired that thats absolutely correct thats unique cancer faced repair workers if it would covered locomotive inspection act safety standard would covered federal law thats correct no well governed different statute found 49 usc 303 well i could finish answer previous question mr chief justice theres specific statute point predated locomotive inspection act provided crippled locomotive  railroad face liability civil penalties bring crippled locomotive back yard specifically said worker injured process railroad would face liability our point locomotive inspection acts field construed narrowly 1970 congress expressly comprehensively legislated federal rail safety act provided conflict preemption regime state rule place rule would permitted survive unless federal rail administration issued regulation and never regulation asbestos well first i would urge read napier like statute although justice brandeis obviously b addressing fitness service standards line the wisconsin georgia statutes issue purported regulate locomotive could operation line thats claims case yes first accept proposition warning claims valid negligence claims the warning claims  affect equipment made its simply use equipment safely secondly design claims go unique hazards faced repair workers you use asbestos theory case locomotive exactly way locomotive equipment manufacturers done long safer way take asbestos locomotive repair yard that distinct kind design claim doesnt go safe operation locomotive it goes hazards created repair worker maintenance work that would both the dust cloud something warned protected protective gear nothing design locomotive there evidence safer safer ways  i remind asbestos isnt used locomotives part historical debate  ways could removed would create cloud dust thats essence design defect claim and lia fra regulate repair shop so completely gap terms no absolutely  absolutely federal rail safety act empowers secretary it  well could fitness service standard but always  look regulations parts 229 230 49 cfr always issues regulations authorities frsa expanded it would bo railroad case early 1930s  another justice brandeis opinion  would make finding make regulation posit justice kagan necessary avoid unnecessary peril life limb in case court struck iccs attempt issue regulation particular type equipment icc could make demonstration so current world fra would regulate frsa would regulate lia courts jurisprudence harder standard meet implement regulatory standard thats point the regulatory field need read expansively side posits fra authority needs frsa chooses promulgate rules chosen promulgate rules the fra use conflict preemption displace state rule seeking take doctrine implied field preemption gain immunity state law liability subject federal rules and proposition extraordinary proposition implied field preemption weve found case court goes far if lose case justice ginsburg decedents family gets nothing takes nothing fela claim rendered summary judgment finding negligence railroad the claim decedents family third party claim manufacturer failing warn design defect basis state law well  ordinarily youd bring failure warn claim directly manufacturer putting manual stamping equipment providing instructions safe use its no its  manufacturers routinely held liable failing warn manuals instruction materials provide instructions safe use equipment if i could save balance time manufacturers clearly best information dangerous aspects products issue warnings instructions manuals provide kinds information persons working equipment going know special hazards it doesnt make sense inoculate manufacturers liability best information ensure repair workers going exposed risks with respect point line whole idea behind locomotive inspection act use justice kennedy also safe operate railroad line  under regulations well established yard limits drawn outside bowl switching operations repair operations occur everybody knows federal lia standard applies doesnt and reason lia kind history respect repair work goes history  behind courts recognition commerce power up new deal era well settled congress could legislate intrastate activities peculiar repair yards court decided shanks case mid 1910s held railroad worker could bring fela claim work interstate commerce intrastate commerce icc throughout entire period never devoted regulations repair yards courts commerce clause jurisprudence precluded federal regulatory activity so look case historical perspective justice kagan clear full parameters way court would explain napier would approach field preemption different new deal era new deal era also court looks regulatory implications common law claims problem allowing state law design defect claims respect planes cars motorboats trucks even though implications state law claim might find liability insufficiency design imposing unreasonable risk person exposed risk respect interstate modality there reason broad expansive view field congress subsequently enacted area give federal agency preemptive authority deems authority appropriate federal government says it though your honor 49 usc 20106 said unless federal government issues regulation particular field states allowed rule effect but thats justice ginsburg point broadly define scope field napier defined historical context dont live reason give manufacturers complete pass liability best information advise railroad  railroads railroad workers work equipment safe way without exposing workers unnecessary risks thank you,417.0,558,24,well hear argument next morning case 10879 kurns v railroad friction products corporation mr frederick so  make icc 1916 tiller case regulating lights railroads locomotives yard lights differ railroad use im sure i understand it prescribed different lights   locomotive yard that nothing safety use it safety repair distinguish reasoning ray case distinguish difference ray case navigation held agency ensuring safety navigation controlled design completely whether repair so  dont apply logic ray case thats argument regulate  design use asbestos youre interfering available components locomotives so youre giving claims well counsel looking napier power justice brandeis said conferred case specify sort equipment used locomotives right so equipment used locomotives yes thats  thats thing thing ill give fitness service it doesnt say something thats going cause harm actually used why depend you want know equipment safe operate right used whether  whether going used if boiler thats going used thats within power confirmed its merely inspect justice brandeis said i guess argument isnt limited taken apart your argument depend fact asbestos doesnt come use right yes accident something asbestos come use locomotive you  would say accident locomotive disabled longer use i suppose thats youd say its unrealistic thats youd say well thats old insurance cases weve know car know slams pole something used car anymore therefore insurance doesnt cover what im concerned i think thing chief justice mentioned particular language napier and whatever  however might come today napier decided come way and justice brandeis write law long time and argument made napier particular state regulation aimed preventing sickness disease making locomotives safe therefore preempted and answer sickness disease object statute the answer federal state statutes directed subject equipment locomotives therefore preemptive now could come favor without overturning seems key sentence napier that problem thats bothering okay thats  problem a followed followed followed followed really read worth forth so  one question extent i go back revise sentence thats a okay whats b not  way could win case  reasonably reasonable way farout way  win case affect manufacturers way dealing equipment what im sure i understand are talking wearing particular hazard suit are talking blowing air are talking changing design asbestos comes without dust cloud thats generally created could i make sure i understand if  secretary tomorrow decided issue regulation saying railroads longer use asbestoscontaining brakes hazards repair shop think secretary could statute but secretary cannot lia is idea okay im little bit lost if secretary issue regulation lia lia isnt scope regulation isnt also scope whats preempted mr frederick could  could clarify stake worker the railroad worker ordinarily fela claim fela claim case dismissed so tell us recourse  lose recovery plaintiff get and also explain fela claim  dismissed you  said i think certainly right bring claim dont say repair shop doesnt adequate warnings and  thats  railroads fault manufacturers owner repair shop everybody ever puts asbestos negligent putting adequate warnings whats wrong no what   getting away equipment saying failure fail put equipment fail put repair shop theres something im seeing thank mr frederick ms harrington and knows  knows napier whats going 85 years wants pull back preemptive effect provisions interpreted napier free that  safety act didnt amend locomotive act the locomotive act didnt put clause thank counsel the case submitted,599.0,1051,9,mr chief justice may please court the lia construed court napier particular passage quoted justice breyer delegates dot exclusive authority determine design materials locomotive equipment petitioners however argue states fact may dictate locomotive design materials long purpose safety use line but passage justice breyer pointed napier holds la  lia preemption purpose locomotive equipment regulation geographic location locomotive line regulation enforced justice sotomayor pointed earlier argument morning regulatory power broader purpose as napier says lia preemption locomotive equipment what napier referred physical elements locomotive frankly i would thought possible i would defer dots view it seems would within dots power lia say locomotive safe operate cant safely repaired because point locomotive ready go line  soon comes line theres problem thats going injure work but dont need assert position defend proposition because field  repair shop versus repair shop field physical elements locomotive what states cannot dot exclusive authority design materials construction locomotive i think your honor design doesnt change line repair shop and thats key if state comes says i understand but statute  reason statute gives power dot ensure locomotives safe use line but order accomplish objective power plenary design they  one entity gets decide design thats dot well i dont necessarily disagree we would necessarily accept proposition we saying dont go we dont disagree i would say  two points your honor first affect design way comply regulation use something asbestos to change design its state saying youre using design use lawfully state following two three things at common law design  failuretowarn claim type design defect claim it way saying cant use design lawfully unless following type warning if  cant assume away design aspect it still turns state conditioning design the lia flsa scaa osha together solved problem  fela solved problem saying repair shops responsibility ensure safety workers we absolutely clear  ms harrington incorrect said we dont believe repair shop states power impose workplace conditions protect employee safety protection repair shop they well could say generally applicable laws govern repair shop  states authority extent preempted osha states authority require workplace conditions require employers protect employees working but cant tell manufacturers heres conditions use design sell design distribute design materials lawfully within state well agree we also think applies respect manufacturers liability repair shop reason i said earlier the locomotive doesnt change so certified safe use line cant  locomotive manufacturer knows everything know looking dot regulations it cant come along say no cant use design use completely different design make safe repair shop well reason i said earlier your honor dont know advance if say theory state adopt warning requirement specific design otherwise approved dot dont know advance whether warning requirements  manufacturers able easily comply 50 different types warning requirements whether warning requirements  stringent easier simply adopt different design the point lia take kind decision making states hands put federal authority make relevant appropriate decisions designs unlawful thats correct the railroad required ensure safe protection employees work a workplace safety sign isnt really warning claim it osha held liable no that would failure because railroads duty fela ensure safe workplace environment thats clear and adequate incentives ensure employees safe work environment if  workers exposed asbestos well current regime fela would preempt claim railroad worker so wouldnt  isnt room state law could  could claim manufacturer independent contractor would claim manufacturer right the manufacturer could held liable state law that would condition design effort state prescribe condition type design if generally applicable law asbestos use yes i would say point law like thats directed particular type equipment becomes potentially conflict preemptive puts condition design particular equipment states free enforce generally applicable laws safe workplace environments asbestos handling we dont problem position we dont  dont  dont believe establish use repair shop establish preemption described justice brandeis napier controls preemption describing  regulatory authority equipment exact equipment a railroad  locomotive designed particular way doesnt change enters repair shop designed fit service well i mean say position doesnt change whether shop different lia preemption  lia regulation isnt repairing the dot may well authority  seem think  repairs lia lia design materials states cant say better preferable locomotive design reason the respondents brief reply brief page 5 makes interesting point they think proved case say lia doesnt example permit dot impose us steel requirement domestic content requirement locomotives the implication would course state could outside field petitioners define state could say locomotives used within state made us steel i dont think makes sense it cant possibly right reason right misunderstands preemption lia described napier of course within general authority dot determine locomotive made us steel authority abused it might arbitrary capricious permissible but content locomotives exclusively within jurisdiction dot states cant decide locomotive otherwise compliant federal regulations well thats part argument main claim first one prohibited state using asbestos it cant happen even though federal regulations said could thats main part claim they secondary claim failure warn submit essentially type design defect claim says youre going use asbestos warn and dont even know  miss harrington describing theres lot  would lot determined conflict preemption applies failure warn given case thats whole problem your honors lia saying dont want expose manufacturers potential future state court litigation i think presented i mean think completely caught design defect issue side  trying defend saying design defect claim also failure warn claim submit two bound together thats correct thats correct thats judge koscinski said law case judge winters said i  i think thats right yes i dont  two things i would say i dont know answer sure i think probably also repair shops  owned railroads thats part problem manufacturers dont know sell  locomotive railroad going servicing conditions yes yes specific equipment what would say state take locomotive equipment given it and locomotive equipment creates risks workers employer may things account risks equipment cant regulated state the equipment cant regulated state respect i think your honor of course i dont think matters napier relied upon 85 years but i think would good argument would decided way today ray case justice sotomayor mentioned similar kind delegation regulatory authority court held kind field preemption there differences one could discuss napier i say if the court questions ill cede balance time,485.0,680,22,well mr hacker could explain i wasnt sure reading brief whether agree disagree governments point agency cannot lia issue kind rule i suggested know saying asbestos containing brakes danger brakes pose repairmen well if right scope authority maybe right right scope authority doesnt follow claims would field preempted might conflict preempted would field preempted longer field but design materials constructions use if make concession aspects design materials construction pertain use and take position use includes use line use repaired repair shop i think youre trouble its designed use im talking word design im talking design use its clear railroad executive couldnt say i need use 10 locomotives division i using two every week repair shop repair right i dont know isnt use dont dont seem agree i know use line seems repair shop obvious extension line everybody knows going to spend one day month repair shop thats part  use why would law preempted law preempted state law says since railroad knows asbestos dangerous revealed since would revealed repair shop railroad provide repair shops appropriate worker safety equipment alternatively lesser railroad provide repair shops documents given workers explain risks overcome now respect ill lump various kinds failuretowarn claims act preempt it doesnt affect design railroad affect use neither i thought that nature notice claim the design whatever but manufacturer issue warnings worker protect hazard so i thought  defective design yes i understand argument you would one standard line another repair shop but telling change design respect it says asbestos you could take measures protect no no that argument would prevent states lawfully regulate repair shop because given repair many could say well wouldnt  could change locomotive design example it carries beds workers repairing get adequate sleep i mean isnt answer argument doesnt affect design say well could comply changing design i dont think what would apply repair shop would also apply locomotive use i suppose would little comfort manufacturer although engine manufactured certified safe use secretary liable unless warns engineer oh isnt safe use circumstances i give warning i mean i cannot imagine thats  thats statute means applied least use engine  tracks what youre saying open box something one line expose risks and saying therefore must post notice tells workers risks and indeed conflict conflict preemption take care but kind thing fall within scope field preemption even napier course referred equipment rule doesnt it refers sign youre going change equipment suppose allegation failure warn workers use special kind mask thats important youre working near asbestos thats claim want now saying manufacturer cannot required give warning are also saying railroad cannot forced give warning repair shop no can railroad held liable failing tell worker use mask can manufacturer liable failing tell railroad how railroad going know whether unsafe how railroad going know whether asbestos unless manufacturer least tells railroad even doesnt tell worker but could  could state law say need special kind mask what independent contractor covered fela  fela under state law hypothesis says need special kind mask its required illinois could railroad held liable failure kind mask state law fela worker let ask question is position engine much use shop running track is position well reason seems somewhat important i cant conceive 50 different state regulations kind gloves things engineer wear  running train track thats seems would help say shop seem say shop different well  saying manufacture certain way they saying manufacture manner consider unsafe warn people well reach failure warn problem case i  im understanding argument correctly youre saying napier controls design  locomotive part includes design defect thats encompassed state law whether design traditional sense failure warn thats basically court said just practical matter im assuming railroad repair yards owned railroad railroad repair people railroad employees correct are they considered railroad employees considered something else just  clear view lia could laws preempt prohibit states tell railroad yards put signs wear protective equipment whatever protect worker repair they cant tell include warning brake mr hacker think would decide napier way came us today thank counsel mr frederick 4 minutes,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,293.0,581,11,mr chief justice may please court i think helpful case try separate field preemption issues conflict preemption issues in governments view issue properly presented case whether petitioners tort claims fall within field preempted lia view they arise injuries occurred locomotive use now respondent would court expand field thats preempted lia include claim anything locomotive equipment regardless whether equipment locomotive use time injury occurred but doesnt make sense absolutely i completely agree youre saying and  im sorry missed  didnt state position clearly brief our view kinds requirements  requirements go design construction materials locomotive used requirements directed repair shop would conflict preempted but wouldnt fall within field thats governed lia lias substantive standard care applies locomotives use no im sorry let clarify i appreciate opportunity clarify in view conflict is conflict federal rule saying use piece equipment cant use piece equipment the conflict one purposes lia federal government regulator equipment used locomotive and means if federal government hasnt spoken whether piece equipment a used locomotive means manufacturers know okay and state rule would effect dictating equipment used locomotive would conflict single regulator objective lia well i think depends warning claim well  respondents  respondents view field thats preempted state could regulate disposal equipment thats removed locomotive repair process even though no but also also respondents view state could regulate workplace hazard requiring workers wear goggles masks yes youre no i think could  im sorry i think could imagine world state says locomotive comes repair shop railroad repair shop attach certain kind clamp wheel certain kind brake makes sure locomotive wont move repair shop and youre done repairing locomotive take locomotive well i think case claims say would conflict preempted within field claims  failure warn claims now manufacturer actually issues warning would required i think question could worked case proceeds well i think depends warning issued you could require manufacturer tell purchaser products pass warning along post warnings repair shop they could require contractual sale product i think sorts detailed issues would things would worked remand case again view question squarely presented case field preemption question and no the lia  standard care lia goes whether locomotive safe use also limit fras regulatory authority this court united states v bo addressed issue the icc time issued regulation requiring certain kind reverse gear instead different kind reverse gear because statute says safe use  safe use line  its safe use lines interstate commerce im aware weve taken broader view regulatory authority lia in napier whats important remember state statute issue applied locomotives use and i think hard take statements broad statements made napier read applying well lia applies locomotive so thing thats broken could fix use would make locomotive unsafe use would violation statute use the line use versus use and tends match well  fact broken makes locomotive unsafe use railroad cannot use cannot repair use thats right but injuries occur locomotive use repair shop and situations lias substantive heightened duty care doesnt even apply doesnt make sense think claims within field thats preempted lia theyre governed lia now claims might bump lia different way conflicting well agree might barred i think case comes court without real development plaintiffs claims all stated complaint their complaint incorporates master complaint applies sorts different kinds plaintiffs so i think really hard understand exactly claims effects claims would respect design defect claims and view would  design defect claims would preempted would effect dictating character equipment could locomotive use thank you,314.0,434,12,dont  dont think one purposes legislation everybody understood enable engine manufacturers able construct engines without worry variety different state requirements railroading national transportation industry whoever makes engine know i way going okay and youre saying wont okay although every state may  every states requirements may preempted  locomotive use 50 states different requirements respect design order make engine safe repaired i think truly frustrates purpose act so  im concerned conflict preemption im concerned state requirements conflict federal im talking 50 state requirements conflict manufacturer look 50 states instead looking secretary says engine safe and youre telling manufacturer longer assume well whats difference how do how  youre thinking manufacturers going to respect locomotive order comply state law warning going mean changes locomotive runs railroad well give example does anything case removal never  use bit locomotive no okay lets get case oh i didnt know anybody denied that state could regulate repair shop indeed require warnings wish indeed require equipment workers i thought talking rules state law would affect manufacturer put way design locomotive and thats im trouble im thinking one would affect repair shops repairs maybe kind equipment could stick front it hook something holds something goes back line take put locker and  know i thought along lines i thought im getting outer space this isnt reality so all right now theoretical value case if manufacturer really controlling repair shop value failure warn claim they cant control whether dont so question ms harrington im still confused scope regulatory authority whether think capacity issue rules meant protect repair workers railway equipment so issue rule lia says asbestoscontaining brakes afraid brakes injure guys roundhouse well  selfabnegation federal government safe use include safe use repaired but seem limiting construction napier seems broader construction i read history right youve taken broader understanding regulatory authority past so narrow view well youre talking  i bet lot things railroad cars fix shop fix way right we always talking brakes so lets suppose theres one things you get shop guy says boy got fix and said well trains leaving going go 10 hours and says okay i fix  use is covered so line youve talking repair shop locomotive tracks thats really line well whats answer question this something fix either place its covered  fix train way covered wait shop so whether use shop its whether something affects whether locomotive go whether do can im sorry go ahead can explain difference  make distinction field preemption conflict preemption does practical significance case i thought agreed design defect claim would barred thank counsel mr hacker,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,2,5,162.0,-68.0

number 1 because setting person made witness purposes fifth amendment proceeding persons guilt punishment adjudicated trial and second regardless whether possible types fifth amendment violations could ever occur trial court reject notion regard specific type fifth amendment violation alleged use statements violation garrity versus new jersey that selfincrimination clause violated proceeding person whose statements issue used adjudicate persons guilt punishment purposes criminal liability thats first reason i dont think thats  thats right justice ginsburg i think reason critical distinguish two issues the first issue privilege selfincrimination invoked second selfincrimination clause actually  actually violated so let give example under courts decision chavez chavez holds nothing else i understand chavez hold nothing happens inside police interrogation room constitute completed violation fifth amendment but say course officer interrogating i cannot say i decline answer questions grounds may incriminate so i think important distinguish question privilege asserted  i assert privilege civil case i assert privilege police interrogation room i assert privilege someone elses criminal trial nothing asking court inconsistent absolutely i  i understand  apparent anomaly justice ginsburg and i think reason though reason assert privilege selfincrimination probable cause hearing reason could assert police interrogation room it risk gives statement setting could later used trial guilt trial merits thats reason could assert privilege probable cause hearing anything happens probable cause hearing actually make witness can asserted absolutely justice breyer our  justice breyer understanding    so  well  well justice breyer i think come and i think points  right we  certainly understand grand  courts decision counselman say grand jury part criminal case purposes fifth amendment and think thats significant justice breyer i agree im aware case defendant tries stop information presented grand jury what i aware numerous statements court says defendant may attack indictment claiming grand jury considered statements obtained violation fifth amendment by count court said least three times we agree yes i understand looking simply language plausible interpretation i dont think thats  right but  i think would inconsistent number things court already said i think would inconsistent concessions i understand friend side made let give one  clear example i think gerstein hearing also pretty clearly part criminal case i understand red brief acknowledge rule theyre advocating doesnt apply gerstein hearing this court estelle  i think competency hearing clearly part criminal case court said estelle  sure well i guess two responses justice kagan i think everything said also would apply grand jury context court repeatedly said cant attack indictment so  we agree justice kagan i think anomaly actually goes deeper  two reasons one kansas law  kansas law probable cause hearing express statutory substitute proceeding grand jury and think would little bit strange say rights substitute proceeding virtue state law  well i  i agree procedures arent certainly justice sotomayor and i understand procedures different im sure though whether criminal case whether im made witness purposes selfincrimination clause but i think theres even bigger problem anomaly actually twopart anomaly threepart anomaly i read courts decisions hurtado gerstein state kansas could choose option number 3 option number 3 grand jury probable cause hearing prosecution goes forward based nothing prosecutors determination probable cause and suggestion would violate selfincrimination clause prosecutor sitting office consider statements so situation far federal constitution concerned kansas three choices grand jury probable cause hearing neither and appears clear option 1 option 3 right friends side asserting would apply and would seem anomalous youd rights option 2 dont option 1 option 3 but  even grand jury analogy isnt persuasive members court i think theres another analogy extremely damaging gerstein analogy i read courts decision gerstein legal question decided gerstein hearing whether probable cause believe accused committed crime legally indistinguishable question kansass probable cause hearing so im sure basis ground would saying right applies probable cause hearing doesnt apply gerstein hearing and i dont think plausible say applies gerstein hearing reasons kansas amicus brief gives simply going practically possible right gerstein hearing nonadversarial proceeding right counsel held within 48 hours arrest detention justice breyer  well  well justice breyer i think reasons court said cant collaterally attack indictment would also argue saying cant file 1983 action well  sure i justice breyer and   reasons court gave recent decision grand  collateral attack grand jury court said well right challenge evidence introduced   grand jury would right discovery you would right try find happening grand jury i   i understand mr smith might want but i  i guess  so  well  well justice breyer i  id say two things first foremost believed statements used way i think useful take step back realize nothing saying suggest mr smith justice breyers example would file  entitled file motion suppress every one statements criminal trial and motion prevailed would likely get dismissal charges actually true governments evidence almost derived compelled statements granting motion suppress trial would effectively end criminal proceeding favor so  thing true if officer vogt correct  statements used obtained used violation garrity  obtained violation garrity case gotten past probable cause hearing i assume expect officer vogts lawyer would filed motion suppress statements trial and garrity claim meritorious i think need assume that motion would granted and motion granted evidence fact  much evidence derived statements i assume criminal proceeding would ended favor so putting defendants position dont opportunity justice  justice i want careful justice sotomayor record i read mr vogts complaint allege ever filed objection that   thats i say based face and based review transcript i   its record i understand  understanding hearing file motion justice sotomayor i  i would certainly say court rule us i would urge make clear right requires timely objection  thats certainly generally true justice sotomayor yes the objection  i justice alito i  i would agree justice alito if questions id like reserve id like make three quick points rebuttal one response justice kagans point apparent oddity regard particular proceeding one suppression hearings one garrity so response justice kagans questions oddity particular type hearing i think beyond fact supreme court kansas held purpose hearing adjudicate guilt punishment i think even important indication kansas law nothing happened hearing could conclusively resolve officer vogts guilt innocence one way and way  reason know supreme court specifically held dismissal charges probable cause hearing preclusive without prejudice states ability reinitiate exact criminal prosecution which rule grand injures right the court said grand jury refuses return indictment mean prosecution cannot ask another grand jury return indictment and fact supreme court kansas reversed trial courts dismissed probable cause hearing theory government able carry proof beyond reasonable doubt burden trial theyve said thats purpose hearing this hearing adjudicate guilt innocence the point suppression hearings i think worth emphasizing response justice ginsburgs point talking possibility someone decide plead guilty without able challenge evidence one simple reason they file pretrial motion suppress many  true large majority prosecutions resolved via guilty plea but also true pleading guilty defendants often file pretrial motions suppress plead guilty denial motion suppress in federal system even sometimes permitted file conditional guilty plea preserve ability challenge admissibility evidence appeal so talking taking people  away peoples ability challenge and last least didnt discuss initial argument court  second argument raised second independent argument relates court could say whatever rule might regard types fifth amendment claims garrity violation trial it would actually similar i understand supermajority court said chavez regard miranda claims i understand chavez court deeply divided whether circumstances involuntariness claim could occur trial but i understood even dissenting justices chavez said miranda claim something accrue trial and i think would make sense comes garrity claims garrity forbid taking statements there garrity violation statement taken the violation garrity later use statement and would suggest court doesnt want reach broader issue could simply say type fifth amendment violation cannot occur statements used trial we ask court  ask judgment reversed,453.0,703,11,well hear argument next case 161495 city hays versus vogt mr heytens mr heytens  your  first statement i  well stated the first reason thing double jeopardy  clause applies it trial so making argument mr heytens recognizing shrinking almost vanishing point possibility using fifth amendment block use incriminating    youre shrinking privilege nothing arent many trials nowadays upwards 95 percent cases disposed plea bargaining so limiting fifth amendment must trial must witness trial youre saying effectively fifth amendment considered important picture criminal cases so mr heytens  defendant based said could refuse answer question put probable cause hearing say tell us episode  retained knife could say i wont might incriminate could raise privilege but cant object prior testimony  prior statement effect introduced probable cause hearing he  said it cant introduced if gives testimony gives statement probable cause hearing thats right doesnt incriminate cant object introduce  introduction prior compelled statement what grand jury proceeding no prevented i mean i  ive come across supreme court cases refer grand jury proceeding part criminal case cannot introduce criminal case so i wondered seemed missing i havent found anything says know cant attack grand jury proceeding later thats different so   somebody finds way gets order judge says i dont want pieces paper introduced taken violation fifth amendment right witness i dont want brought grand jury im rather surprised thats never come and  cases say even though person objected introduce grand jury i cant find and i found cases say grand jury criminal proceeding mr heytens also agree dont probable cause hearing part criminal case thats issue okay so i look language selfincrimination clause shall compelled criminal case  theres issue compulsion maybe there isnt shall compelled criminal case witness to witness im thinking natural reading terms testimony introduced adverse interests criminal case so isnt asking kind obvious interpretation right well i dont think estelle  inconsistent court estelle said actually neutral determination and thats understandable consider victory win youre declared incompetent continue detained incompetent so   like like well obviously  obviously i want win i get criminal case yes i mean youre quite right theres  right grand jury different might kind anomaly explained i think kind historic judgment grand juries sacrosanct everything secret dont want people poking around black box none true standard probable cause hearings im sorry  you  in grand jury theres adversarial pursuit theres judge theres defendants lawyer theres anything like grand jury so cant  imperfect substitute best well i dont  back first question i dont know answer grand jury proceeding i know cant attack proceeding trial i dont know whether case somebody might used bring 1983 claim ground constitutional rights violated thats happened and i dont know would happen circumstance defendant went judge said judge keep piece paper grand jury proceeding so i think perhaps treated alike i dont know alike why i dont know maybe could i mean  i  i dont even know go look and i assume youve looked yeah right i see who would  so  instance committee investigating mr smith mr smith takes fifth amendment 90  94 times compel give kinds statements theres grand jury goes judge says judge keep statements and mr  yeah and i understand he says taken violation fifth amendment right and  and keep keep grand jury huh and youre telling  important case ways one decide i guess would decide thing grand jury im  im sorry  mr heytens  can step back second your brief notes respondent file motion suppress statements object probable cause hearing admission isnt waiver well youve seen record so  and wouldnt ruling us mean defendants  whether within 48 hours hearing thats held probable cause hearing et cetera wouldnt putting onus defendants raise valid objection one well thats matter   law if dont object admission statement youve waived objection are familiar cases  i dont know states say  federal law allow person thinks may investigation grand jury go federal judge file motion limine regarding evidence may presented grand jury this would revolutionary wouldnt thank counsel ms prelogar thank counsel the case submitted,1083.0,1887,28,mr chief justice may please court our test violation selfincrimination clause one court always applied a compelled testimonial incriminating statement cannot used criminal case that test four requirements each comes directly fifth amendments text petitioner concedes three that statement compelled used criminal case witness means testimonial that leaves requirement statement this court long recognized statement someone used criminally prosecute incriminating petitioner contest officer vogts statement incriminating instead urges court redefine word clause longer applies criminal case portion criminal case guilt ultimately adjudicated there numerous fatal flaws theory ill start fifth amendments text petitioner explanation framers would chosen circuitous way limit clauses application if framers intended clause apply criminal trials wouldnt hidden limitation word they would said criminal trial instead criminal case and particularly implausible  no certainly probable cause low bar i think kaley court described reasonable belief defendant committed crime and get probable cause hearing government enough evidence meet bar outside  defendants compelled statement theres reason get issue they able show probable cause yes point adversarial courtroom proceeding last step moving trial government point prove probable cause defendants compelled statement makes enormous sense figure stage whether statement admissible reason justice ginsburg pointed earlier 95 percent time hearing whole ball game once prosecution gets probable cause determination vast majority defendants choose plead instead  yes well  defendant position wont know admissibility determination theyve already rolled dice gone trial and vast majority defendants going take conservative route take guilty plea even though  government turns didnt even enough evidence show probable cause yeah i mean admissibility statement sometimes going clear youre talking compelled garrity statement obviously admissible but lot time going different questions sure  defense counsel going advise  defendant  likelihood success trial yeah yeah so none record reason  yeah but i   yes but  laughter but  but  yeah so  yeah i  yeah so really important explain reason record petitioner chose seek courts interlocutory review pleading stage and petitioner raised questions court it conceded point complaint adequately alleges statement used probable cause hearing petitioner contesting and none questions ripe resolution point petitioners cert strategy and  no the violation complete statement used criminal case so section 1983 establishes liability causing deprivation constitutional right and i want point petitioner challenged court whether adequately alleged proximate causation in answering  yeah yeah so  ill say  yeah so tenth circuit applied settled law regard proximate causation all court appeals held cause section 1983 incorporates common law principles  proximate causation so tenth circuit said police chief went kansas bureau investigation said here officer vogts compelled statements initiate criminal investigation reasonably foreseeable that  statements would ultimately introduced criminal case and ill say ninth circuit seventh circuit i guess sixth circuit addressed similar circumstances come conclusion so im aware circuit split issue certainly court thats section 1983 question petitioner chosen present court fifth amendment question its constitutional question everything thats going decided remand so  yeah yeah and court wanted dig case improvidently granted would certainly object i think said brief opposition thought premature take question time  i continue talk record  okay laughter so  going back  yeah so going back  question question petitioner presented court  yeah yeah there evidence theyve gummed and i also want say  asserted circuit split cases supposedly support petitioners position none actually addressed circumstance postcharge pretrial use compelled statement they cases similar chavez defendant  i guess plaintiff attempting rely precharge compulsion make fifth amendment claim now  well i clarify least one cases compelled statement also used initiate charges yeah yeah so im going attempt answer concisely caveat would take entire second set briefs adequately address nuances courts grand jury jurisprudence neither government attempted this different complicated question  best simple answer hubbell counselman hold clause applies grand injuries with added limitation lawn calandra williams courts dont authority crack open indictments grand jurys status independent constitutional fixture its textually assigned judicial branch that said courts crack open indictments time thats whole point kastigar hearing and court finds jury  grand jury made use derivative use compelled immunized statement remedy dismiss indictment unlawful that irreconcilable petitioners theory perfectly fine government use compelled statements way point trial so practical matter  yes yes thats fine  thats far went  briefing complicated question but yes  lawncalandrawilliams limitation cracking open indictments would apply probable cause hearings  unique historical posture isnt also nature proceeding different a probable cause hearing adversarial courtroom proceeding judge isnt anything crack open so leads petitioners policy point whether makes sense apply clause probable cause hearings way thats different clause applies grand juries and court answered question coleman v alabama said sixth amendment right counsel applies probable cause hearings exact sort probable cause hearing issue even though right apply grand juries and justice whites concurrence made ominous predictions death probable cause hearings petitioner made didnt happen its 48 years later vast majority states still using probable cause hearings primary mechanism pursuing felony prosecutions even though right counsel surely burdensome state selfincrimination privilege so id like go back courts precedent i think important not history country court relied term witness  limit use compelled incriminating testimonial statement violates clause so i would look  courts definition criminal prosecution rothgery know criminal case least broad criminal prosecution and rothgery says defendants first appearance judicial officer formally told charges deprivations imposed liberty and theres question that covers probable cause hearing so  estelle case competency what court held estelle defendants rights violated use psychiatric exam sentencing proceeding so holding forecloses notion clause trial right what petitioner government latching onto two sentences dicta court said well psychiatric exam limited function determining whether defendant understood charges capable assisting defense fifth amendment problem wouldnt arose that consistent position ill explain a competency hearing part criminal case i imagine time three requirements clause going substantially limit application hearings so estelle explains routine competency exam focused exclusively whether defendant understands charges capable assisting defense that determination require extracting testimonial incriminating statements defendant and extent defendant volunteered put competency issue might even compelled so  so clause  yeah so narrow circumstance defendant forced undergo psychiatric exam answering questions makes compelled incriminating testimonial statement cant admitted competency hearing part criminal case but limitation shouldnt affect utility competency hearings i think important point estelle didnt even involve competency hearing there psychiatrist sent letter judge simply said i find defendant understands difference right wrong understands charges capable assisting defense yeah so gerstein hearing part criminal case fourth amendment requirement its substitute arrest warrant so court fleshed point well last term manuel v city joliet and gerstein explains fourth amendment requirement whole panoply rights sixth amendment apply gerstein hearings yes so i dont know gerstein hearing  no point  well depends whether  would gerstein hearing gerstein hearing thats contemplated gerstein hearing within 48 hours arrest   purpose get arrest warrant fact theres reason fifth amendment requirements would apply hearing sixth amendment requirements dont its   extent happening time  criminal case  happening parallel yeah so gerstein hearing  gerstein determination could folded something thats happening within criminal case so i understand happen sometimes the  state quickly file charges fold gerstein hearing arraignment but theres nothing requiring states so emergency situation state  know need take physical custody someone confessed murdering whole family  clause would prohibit government getting gerstein determination based confession later pulling together evidence necessary make probable cause showing court yeah yes thats right yes and bail determinations made different sorts proceedings  gerstein hearing gerstein contemplating substitute warrant so instead  police want take custody someone theyve gotten arrest warrant go neutral adjudicator say do i sufficient evidence justify arrest that fourth amendment requirement yes exactly yes the privilege  yeah  right and thats  thats reasoning gerstein gerstein says sixth amendment rights would apply hearing know  justice alitos i think hypothetical gerstein hearing would happening within criminal prosecution but gerstein says rights dont apply context yes so petitioner asked court interpret section 1983 yeah so i think thats question statutory interpretation congressional intent if congress wanted limit section 1983 way could but theres indication plain language section 1983 limited way yeah well  yeah so i want start saying court held minnesota v murphy garrity privilege selfexecuting employee situation boss says lose job dont make statements selfexecutes so dont raise privilege  moment but  response response  state supposed happened highly unusual since 1970s department justice police departments across country developed best practices ensure compelled statements used criminal investigations so statement compelled via administrative investigation grant immunity statement formally siloed criminal investigation so happened police chiefs decision take compelled statement hand kansas bureau investigation say investigate highly unusual frankly hard understand given ubiquity garrity protocols country so i  go back point earlier whether dramatic revolution what proposing law always all  police departments across country department justice would say even case coming court police chief  illegal yes so best practices whoever involved  taking compelled statement siloed criminal investigation  government prove  criminal investigation ultimate prosecution happened entirely independent  well asking question part administrative investigation    yes cant use statement now could independent criminal investigation  so youre talking government employer making inquiry employee part administrative investigation   government  circumstances government gives grant immunity cannot used thats  thats law since kastigar garrity yes so compelled statement privilege selfexecuting least  yeah yeah and   rule petitioners theory would correct  correct disincentives employee cooperation sorts administrative investigations would skyrocket grant immunity applies trial could compel statements employee pain losing job turn around use statements criminally prosecute keep custody way point criminal trial  yes thats rule since garrity  kastigar now i want distinguish unwarned statements compelled statements so unwarned statement miranda rights read necessarily constitutional violation that prophylactic exclusionary rule court may may extend preliminary hearings but comes compelled statement whether immunized constitution clear it cannot used criminal case and  framers intended well we know framers based clause common law privilege specifically applied preliminary proceedings that true first statement yeah no sorry so thats  thats actually correct so voluntarily made first statement police chief the police chief told  needed document happened pain losing job that compelled statement then made statement tendered resignation third statement gave details happened so  question impact  resignation third statement grabs yes yeah so  complaint  resignation happened second third statement okay it and odd case petitioner chose seek courts review pleading stage petitioner chose present fifth amendment question court so would use statement probable cause hearing the complaint alleges emotional damages reputational damage loss income seeks punitive damages petitioner contested adequacy allegations no would inconsistent complaint the complaint says city haysville withdrew job offer point criminal investigation  kansas bureau yeah i would say record petitioner challenged adequacy allegations at minimum would entitled nominal damages so i want emphasize talking incriminating testimonial statement government extracted defendant there nothing radical saying government able use statement purpose criminal case that  framers position they found offensive civilized system justice allow prosecutors  enlist defendants instruments condemnation they thought crucial democracy prosecutions proceed based independent labor governments officers petitioners theory contrary rejected im happy answer questions,657.0,1080,29,well seem assume probable cause hearing state gathered evidence  done investigation witnesses order thats way probable cause hearings work no  point government might readily available evidence ultimately use well thats  well right but plea  content plea agreement affected whether statements going admissible trial its dont  prosecutor doesnt worry deciding plea offer well i dont know thats true they  theyre represented counsel counsel look say look theyre never going able use dont plea maybe theyll offer something else but fact going resolved plea bargain context rather actual trial i dont see pertinence for  reasons problem i suddenly see first time win win major change pretty hard see say attack preliminary hearing cannot attack grand jury cannot attack estelle hearing different hearings   theyve talking suddenly whereas previously havent done whatever set historical reasons suddenly subject lot attacks so makes pretty careful and reason i looked whether objected i see magistrate running  preliminary hearing know unless somebody tells statements taken violation fifth amendment one i dont see ever tell magistrate two looking transcript preliminary hearing i couldnt find instance compelled statements introduced preliminary hearing so i would like tell pages look preliminary transcript i show object least compelled statements used it may record but  but thats important point isnt of course important point well start  extended exchange material something thats record i  well i guess i would like point record theres reason find things whats record including know record how know adequately  chance people object its  passing comment record nor  actually mine passing comment article iii constitution says take real cases controversies and decide major matter fact going record earlier stage discovering true instance complaining mind raises question whether fact appropriate case controversy court take and supposed decide whether cases controversies according law and far im concerned coming saying i want know thing thats record different somebody else coming street saying hey wait minute i know happened case so   go ahead answer its question youve presented go ahead answer but i want  you dont answer i  i  i  no feel free im saying i discount answers something thats record well  odd case and wasnt case involving  case right take appeal its case decided  decided take city right take  take appeal but let ask what   city violate fifth amendment time officer questioned then suing city i understand im trying understand seems like odd case im trying understand whats really involved thats one thing    i dont understand how cause   theory caused prosecution counsel clear  i think concurring opinion case good job pointing questions asked justice alito justice breyer substantial question whether statements compelled there substantial question whether objection there lots questions concurrent said still decided correct yeah just  could i go back there circuit split theres three circuits one side three circuits  four side among four tenth ninth seventh second support position do know whether works gummed circuits well unless distinguish grand jury    issue enormous implications reasons brought justice breyers questions so could distinguish grand jury ms corkran suppose i want go grand jury business mostly i think long tradition cracking open unless and know might right grand jury context weve decided wide variety ways that right get remedied way easily quickly anything contexts would  wouldnt correct well test determining whether proceeding part criminal case purposes how distinguish estelle does  but answer though general  clause apply apply competency hearing the evidence  evidence obtained violation  privilege would admissible competency hearing so gerstein hearing bail hearing but i thought said  criminal case begins  defendant  appears court called upon answer charges thats  gerstein doesnt satisfy yeah wouldnt  criminal  federal case theres complaint wouldnt begin time filing complaint wouldnt beginning criminal case im  im following answer in federal case complaint filed beginning criminal case view everything happens part criminal case first appearance  initial appearance court thats part  criminal case the bail hearing part criminal case the  competent  theres competency hearing thats part criminal case its part criminal case right if i understand youre saying  maybe i dont   substitute exactly proceeding would take place police decided needed arrest warrant right and proceeding would say privilege apply   criminal case yet commenced   arrest made correct is  possible ask   1983 case could say opinion plaintiff 1983 case bring claim preliminary hearing consider  considered matters taken violation fifth amendment must allege complaint objected hearing otherwise magistrate would idea supposed i know havent im asking well answer there many many ways  statement individual could violate  incrimination in case asked questions superiors police department threat leaving   dont know considers violation fifth amendment then statements go court preliminary hearing magistrate doesnt know person considers violation fifth amendment what magistrates police department supposed theyre necessarily conversant facts case one objects i dont understand you  talk  siloed  idea youre supposed pretend person didnt say said conducting investigation well person says  know say youve got tell happened youll fired person says know i buried body hes supposed tell anybody yeah i want make sure i understand so hes investigating said anything disappearance person says i buried body next barn person point supposed say okay im going turn fred im going tell anything yes theres grant immunity theres  youve got tell us im going fire in words thing compelled statement for purposes ongoing investigation so employer requires statement made employee says crime committed employer cannot tell police department this odd case im quite sure compelled statement facts ive read  i know theyre record i know chief says  first employer  employer didnt compel statements he went employer wanted different job all right on second statement went chief said im resigning well i  thats whats going litigated i thought announced resignation request additional  that  ill take but still odd case if case  case goes trial prove officer suffered damage result probable cause hearing result  result admission made alleged  allegedly compulsion city yeah  prove reason didnt get job police department probable cause hearing statement made that nothing probable cause hearing he wanted probable cause hearing could statement hurt how put  prove damage thank counsel four minutes mr heytens,356.0,723,15,mr chief justice may please court the selfincrimination clause prohibits using defendants compelled statement adjudicate criminal responsibility that kind prohibited incriminatory use occur pretrial probable cause hearing defendants guilt punishment line question whether hell bound next stage criminal case id like begin  well clear justice kagan think defendant situation would still  would still valid privilege selfincrimination could reasonably fear anything says probable cause hearing could used ensuing trial prove guilt so defendant could invoke privilege prevent testimony and point way government could compel defendant speak would formally grant immunity only granting immunity   court recognized immunity cases conveying defendant conferring  i think government could draw adverse inference i think inference would matter government already come forward sufficient evidence show would expect defendant respond speak hearing and point i think government already proven probable cause so i cant imagine case would make difference draw adverse inference defendant situation thats right we think part criminal case well i think reason think that things permissible consequence probable cause hearing simply interim step criminal procedure  go criminal trial and i think context proceeding defendants exposed risk statements going used really consequential things guilt punishment hasnt functioned witness  thats  thats true   justice sotomayor i think selfincrimination clause focuses  defendants exposure and theres chance end hearing magistrate could enter judgment conviction criminal punishment could ensue i think that cant test would inconsistent courts decision estelle versus smith the court recognized would selfincrimination problem using defendants compelled statement adjudicate competence stand trial  well thats court held cases like lawn calandra defendant  well i think  i  i  well issue justice breyer i think oftentimes wont apparent outset evidence obtained  violation constitution i tell  i tell pretrial probable cause hearings federal rule rule 51 majority state jurisdictions defendants prohibited rule challenging admission evidence grounds unlawfully acquired now doesnt mean lack remedy they file motion suppress get issue resolved face consequence either taking plea going trial but i think rules recognize  distinctions body evidence thats available probable cause hearing well hearsay routinely admitted so i think rules recognize probable cause hearing fundamentally distinct issues going resolved guilt stage its lesser consequence defendant he doesnt face exposure possibly conviction punishment adjudicated and reason courts recognized court cases like gerstein brinegar barber recognized defendant doesnt right determination made body evidence would admissible trial i think would depend basis court ruled us now i understand respondent suggested ways narrow i understand tenth circuits rule case i read tenth circuits opinion youre criminal case proceedings covered and respondent identifies limiting constructions i think would limit number procedures rule would apply looking things like legal issue resolved case potential consequence so sense i think court could write opinion narrows probable cause hearing issue but ultimately court  im  im sure would lose hopefully i think argument would make would look purpose gerstein hearing would say purpose determine whether pretrial detention continue and would different purpose probable cause determination bindover determination but i think actually focus purpose shows prevail case  purpose proceeding fundamentally different fundamentally distinct kinds issues defendant face trial  well i think justice ginsburg goes back lesser consequences probable cause hearing its meant full dress rehearsal trial meant necessarily resolve exactly evidence going admissible trial and i think thats anomalous look proceedings generally operate admission hearsay example admission evidence might later determined violated fourth amendment exactly and i think that would also problem trying apply rule gerstein hearing proceedings arent adversarial safeguards adversarial presentations i think court adopt rule like one tenth circuit adopted really would gum works essentially forcing adjudication suppression questions outset case issue could resolved gerstein determination could made bail set well justice sotomayor i think that shows complicated questions defendant would to preserve argument and  court earlier  earlier cases observed lot times outset case suppression question might complicated factintensive a defendant might realize valid claim and put onus  well theres certainly lot variants state jurisdictions handle issue i think  problem  well thats i think  read criminal cases issue hasnt largely arisen hasnt requirement courts adjudicate suppression questions sequencing preliminary proceedings resolve issues case if court instead adopt broader rule find use proceeding criminal case could violate fifth amendment i expect would require substantial changes criminal process,260.0,414,8,ms  ms prelogar i  i guess would mean conceptual matter even practical matter conceptual matter government could force somebody testify proceeding yeah so i said maybe practical matter conceptual matter would saying government could chose accepted certain consequences could force testify right how how didnt testify could  could government draw inference failing testify government could example civil case yeah i guess questions seems odd something understood part criminal case i dont  i  i  i take continuing objection view either  so know seems odd something  clearly part criminal case say yes government draw adverse inference dont worry wont never come yes government could force testify dont worry would give immunity  wouldnt want it seems conceptually difficult position im sorry  dont win probable cause hearing ends case so consequence respect innocence  innocence proven guilty because ends case it end but increases possibility found guilty punishment imposed what  things i mean work ive  ive conducted grand juries colleagues i mean i imagine kinds unconstitutionally seized evidence it could violate fourth amendment it could violate fifth amendments coerced confession it could violate one 15  15 know five six different constitutional prohibitions and prosecutor says im going go introduce stuff grand jury defendant remedy whatsoever then happen time grand juries introduce coerced confessions introduce  comes surprise i mean experience they introduce illegally seized evidence introduce constitutionally impermissible evidence i want know happens i guess relevant happens i  i  i educated and seems like important point ms prelogar suppose rule issue do think  that would necessary consequences kinds proceedings and  mr heytens spent time talking gerstein hearings do think  identical gerstein hearings whatever we would think distinction drawn two in words  rule government come back next time say ah lose good argument make here  determine whether theres enough evidence go trial and one hand youre conceding evidence couldnt come trial used determine whether theres enough evidence go trial that seems strange but use determine whether theres enough evidence go trial evidence cant come trial i suppose dont know probable cause hearing whether going admissible may defendants argument defendants side case i mean thats whole point grand jury proceedings only raised only raised theres lot jurisdictions already give defendants rights right beginning case some exercise some dont a lot dont theres lot reasons defendant doesnt want early very seem gummed way youre anticipating create problem thank counsel ms corkran,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-18,-12,-388.0,-204.0

treatment older workers based false assumption productivity competence decline old age the age discrimination employment act protects workers 40 older kind disparate treatment it stretched cover claims workers 40 older treated disparately basis comparative youth they  justice oconnor that interpretation deserves deference three reasons id like summarize first elaborate the first chevron question  question deference dependent whether theres definitional ambiguity  specific operative language case section 623a  language means read context act and chevron says using traditional tools statutory construction applying test submit  i hope elaborate morning one cannot come conclusion   statute fairly read authorize kinds youth discrimination claims issue the second reason however even  even ambiguity general submit holding express holding mead  eeocs regulation entitled chevron deference reason this page 227 mead opinion 533 us the sentence states holding mead says regulation entitled chevron deference  promulgated  agency given congress authority promulgate rules force law acknowledge true but second half test  statement holding mead  rule promulgated exercise authority regulation eeoc defending today  rule given force law agency in fact agency made  department labor initially promulgated regulation made deliberate decision promulgate rule force law instead promulgate solely guidance public  enforcement authority because department labor said federal register promulgated it said promulgating matter enforcement guidelines  guidance  public knows intend enforce   statute it promulgate rule law and repromulgated eeoc 1981  cites page 17 reply brief  repromulgated eeoc 1981 eeoc made deliberate choice explained federal register substantive rule force law fact comply stated going comply 30day notice period required substantive rules law if  well would get skidmore deference justice kennedy i think christensen specifically says that gets skidmore deference enforcement guideline   rule law  substantive rule law but skidmore  applying skidmore deference due regulation principally regulation  enforced anything like consistent manner to contrary the  holding mead justice scalia the  holding  sentence thats mead says the question mead whether regulation promulgated  force law not necessarily but made deliberate decision wasnt going force law example 1981 right right justice scalia but comply 30day notice period required but rules force law the question whether agency intended rule law  guidance enforcement authority  clearly intended latter acted manner consistent fact latter former routinely refuses enforce principle government advocating today indeed every single instance issue come department labor equal opportunity  eeoc  since mid1970s every single instance  department labor eeoc blessed  employment practice provides comparatively older workers benefit available workers  workers 40 older the 1997 adjudication seems something give rise chevron deference  acting pursuant view    statute it binding parties justice souter course even  court conclude mead get chevron deference i dont think reason still problem view fundamental problem id like address yes but i think fundamental point us mead id like move back main  chevron analysis i could fundamental point us mead justice breyer agency made deliberate decision rule one binding rule i dont see agency could justice scalia think force law didnt follow manifold decision issue thats  thats correct  i think summarize point strongly going  i agree justice souter  going back main question whether even get ambiguity chevron submit answer question section 623a read isolation the fundamental principle statutory construction needs read context relative contextual indicators submit foreclose argument congress intended adea authorize kind youth discrimination claims issue i respectfully disagree justice ginsburg   im  im looking page 3a statutory appendix governments brief  provision located bi statute preamble older worker benefit protection act states  provide employers affirmative defense charge discriminated comparatively older workers providing benefits lower level comparatively younger workers and  bi says i take provision your honor referring situation even though comparatively older worker disfavored comparatively older worker affirmative defense older worker  employer show  spent least much benefit older worker younger worker even benefit less we  yes justice oconnor we shoehorn provision it  still pending court thats correct your honor we think your honor of course respondents wont agree im quite sure i  i dont think thats going solve many problems sixth circuits decision gave rise for example yeah  let  i  i think gives protection complete protection i think whole range negative consequences your honor id like address i could  i certainly directly address safe harbor provision first number employment practices nations major employers engaged efforts retain older segments workforce bring back elderly citizens back workforce things providing workers certain threshold age often 55 ability work parttime rather fulltime flextime schedules  jobs dont involve travel theyve changed terms conditions privileges employment people certain age keep workforce the safe harbor applies benefits justice kennedy therefore would protect kind behavior although united states talks safe harbor respect benefits i would point brief united states notably silent question whether interpretation advocated would make illegal kind conduct and submit would clearly prefers comparatively older comparatively younger respect terms conditions privileges employment yeah yes yes there dol eeoc letters approve practices hard see one could possibly approve practices consistent interpretation section 623a imposed rigid rule equality everyone 40 yes we justice oconnor actually second category adverse effect seems  decision stands rule law  government advocates many provisions detailed quite effectively erisa committee brief provide  things employees  employee stock option plans esop plans allowed become 55 years old diversify stock holdings employees retire 5912 withdraw money retirement plans without facing tax penalty there host provisions like one point made seems irreconcilable existence provisions interpret 623a way point  friends respondents say yeah dont worry rule laterenacted statute governs formerenacted statute take care im afraid thats following reason all examples i gave many others  erisa committee brief statutes congress enacted 1990 i submit 1990 relevant date laterenacted statute   thats  older worker benefit protection act passed betts passed 1990 statute made adea applicable first time fringe benefits kind regulations govern so serious problem minimum respect regulations seems well i say i  i i lot say justice scalia the first thing the critique government levels us respect provision equally applicable interpretation what say know lawful statute grant preference old age  doesnt make sense say thats lawful advertise old age  course   age means chronological age wouldnt able state preference chronological age advertisement even though would perfectly lawful substantively policy said youre going open positions people 40 older so i dont think get mileage  i think theyve got kind linguistic difficulty respect and i think shows justice scalia well i think could read meaning old age i think truth matter word age something chameleon its word sensitive context going somewhat different connotations throughout statute i think quite clear its different connotation example section b statement findings purposes quite clear congress talking chronological age it different connotation seniority provision find page 3a governments statutory appendix talks involuntary retirement near bottom page employers plan cannot require involuntary retirement individual specified subsection 631 title age individual now sense means chronological age sense friends side 623a means really youve become old enough youve bumped age limit provisions 623 age functions exactly way i dont think  i think really case like robinson shell oil word employee takes different connotations different sections like  like scheidler word enterprise various subsections rico takes different connotations depending exactly used i think word age takes different connotations different sections statute well i think  i i think  weve thought sense justice breyer i think dovetails i  i think key contextual point statute protects people 40 older congress concerned rule precluded arbitrary discrimination favor comparatively old well comparatively young exceedingly strange thing to draw line age 40 course people 40 much likely subject discrimination ground theyre comparatively young people 40 laughter not anymore your honor laughter but i  i think  i think thats  best statement argument side i think governments effort defend line basis i dont think works reason people 40 problem suffer adverse employment action  government acknowledges argument  subject discrimination ground perceive  perceived old thats problem thats problem government able identify people 40 suffer kind yes justice souter i think thats true  623a isnt allpurpose prohibition arbitrary employment decisions respecting people 40 and kind critique could made  employee fired theyre fit enough wrong color hair it  thats thing voluminous history  enactment amendments provides support governments view response   provide support i agree but i really think i think  i think justice kennedy  important go back source statute understand congress trying circumstances enactment statute after congress could either 1964 passed title vii 1967 enacted statute simply put word age title vii operate exactly manner title vii but made deliberate choice the reason i submit recommendations secretary labor response directive congress problem age discrimination workplace fundamentally different problem  problems addressed title vii and critical difference  kinds discrimination title vii addressed discrimination basis characteristics always irrelevant decision hired fired promoted demoted and secretary labor said age different age irrelevant age distinctions always arbitrary i submit court  opinion court betts identified exactly principle different kind problem warranting different kind solution the problem stereotypes exist   employers act  prospective employees  dont competence productivity handle job old problem statute tried address tried address fundamentally different manner title vii context makes difference again  i think court really recognize betts justice kennedy betts operative language privileges  terms conditions privileges employment identical title vii  adea but court concluded betts that language different meaning in title vii included fringe benefits in adea include fringe benefits reason reading provision isolation context rest statute quite clear title  adea meant address different kind problem agebased decisionmaking appropriate invidious ought prohibited law and i submit kind agebased decisionmaking thats issue case precisely kind agebased decisionmaking congress want make unlawful and reason quite  quite simply people end working lives different position especially respect retirement security measure issue  issue even 41yearold someone else protected class and employer acts general dynamics union come solution protected harsh outcome protected reliance interests simply anything remotely within contemplation congress   prohibitory  prohibitory sections adea if court i  i believe  i believe comparable number i confess your honor i dont know sure exact number if court questions id like reserve balance time,529.0,774,23,well hear argument no 021080 general dynamics land systems inc v dennis cline mr verrilli well mr verrilli  perhaps say language statute individual age  individuals age  somehow ambiguous but extent give deference agency position thing because government taking position contrary based agency interpretation how  know what   say specifically well could call enforcement position enforcement policy part agency youre going probably say cant  shouldnt call  could doesnt government get deference you say gets deference that  thats different issue lets  lets come back point whether promulgated interpretive regulation substantive regulation you taking position substantive regulations entitled chevron deference only   substantive regulations mead say all regulations sec example virtually interpretive regulations no   point that equate interpretive no didnt they  promulgated page 17 brief interpretation rather substantive regulation thats you dont  interpretive regulations for substantive regulations you interpretive regulations mean interpretive regulation  entitled chevron deference fully  effective  laying rule law substantive regulation thats never  rule mr  mr verrilli i  i assume youre  youre right  application mead far reg goes what  i think 1997 adjudication wasnt binding  wasnt binding parties before leave i read two sentences mead first sentence says fair assume generally congress  congress contemplates administrative action effect law provides relatively formal administrative procedure say doesnt exist next sentence said significant notice comment pointing chevron authority want procedure decide case sometimes found reasons chevron deference even administrative formality required none afforded so i read last sentence i certainly thought congress intends give chevron deference rule complied even notice comment so i couldnt read mead saying dont get deference well i  i dont know often agency says agency said promulgating indication intend enforce law and youre saying chasm rules issued kind statement rules issued otherwise the agency says one case law case interpret law i  i dont see that makes difference well thats  thats different point thats different point well isnt  isnt  isnt stronger point  combined  relatively abbreviated procedure fact number instances followed never affirmatively   administrative movement never affirmatively enforced isnt  isnt which i think goes chevron point why mr verrilli   623f2b  makes express provision older worker versus younger worker if general interpretation statute specific provision relating older worker visavis younger worker would unnecessary well provision cover situation think i mean could fit clients situation provision and  still pending court argument so matter would take position that provision cover case well  thats next point the  briefs try tell us theres going cataclysmic consequences dont rule way this safe harbor provision gives substantial protection  has eeoc taken enforcement position reference practices youve  nonenforcement positions one amicus briefs pointed number internal revenue code provisions erisa provisions appear implicated go sixth circuit view perhaps would opposition interpretation given language sixth circuit now commented various provisions mr verrilli do section 623e prohibits advertising employer indicating preference limitation specification discrimination based age now age could possibly mean say means 623a old age would prohibit preferring older people so say means it means young in means old age e means young age no  still meaning beneficial effect interpretation whereas interpretation age conceivable beneficial effect you read meaning young age read meaning old age you must thought tried it doesnt work i reading i thought perhaps individual might refer older individual if  i mean must im sure  didnt work because    read individual throughout  cite 1ai older individual the place bite get end older individuals i  i thought big deal 40th birthday i mean but isnt  isnt answer   argument youve made  general proposition anything effect interrupts skews employment somebody age 40 difficult somebody age 40 deal regardless way discrimination working that general rule true younger people thats would make sense   interpretation  suggested draw line 40 well 41yearolds perceived old relation people less 41 still means somebody looks 41yearold  41yearold attractive employee somebody know year  year younger two years younger mr verrilli  justice souter suggested fit comment senator yarborough put said 42yearold would claim 52yearold preferred say hiring promotion the  part explanation  diminished hurt 40yearold within  within universe society whole within context company hurtful these people age younger children educated forth find discrimination within company doesnt help much say well society whole doesnt discriminate do know numbers mr verrilli we i think 200 people class thats suing 40 49yearold how many grandfathered 50 very well mr verrilli mr biggerman well hear you,467.0,653,0,mr chief justice may please court the real issue whether court add additional element adeas prohibition language and answer submit the adea prohibits discrimination individuals 40 years old older age older age petitioner would court change language require individuals 40 older also relatively older group employees your honor encompassed affirmative defenses what asserting simply whether respondents cause action that would prohibited subject affirmative defense for example bona fide occupational qualification your honor   submit congress set forth specific examples exceptions made your honor would give employer affirmative defense said  permit  could repeat example well i  i think  let expand little answer i think congress goal make age neutral factor employment now i dont think congress intended permit special considerations age unless theyre set forth statute your honor i dont think adea conflicts provisions cause action unlike case 12b6 case dismissed allowed go forward and employer  situation regulations statutory provisions law  irs your honor i would  i would analogize courts decision mcdonald v santa fe prior mcdonnell douglas court said  set forth first prima facie requirement requiring minority title vii yet mcdonald v santa fe said sex that sue like age act your honor i must  i must humbly confess i dont grasp entire statute every situation every regulation i wish moment i but i would give general answer congress intended make age neutral exception exemption statute regulation provided affirmative defense would impermissible based age your honor i definitely think deference 16252 interpretive guideline is youre referring yes also supported agency adjudication 1997 adjudication confirmed entire commission it understanding eeoc promulgated notice comment its  understanding that accurate it i  i  belief goes congress intentions i think congress set set forth specific exemptions including older workers benefit protection act instances older workers favored therefore i dont think went congress intention i mean older workers benefit protection act set forth whole bunch additional exemptions regulation already place the adea laughter your honor i  i think youre right it good many years ago i  statement district court incorrect the decision mississippi light  mississippi power light decision rendered district courts decision least one decision no your honor little bit im looking cite as   see your honor hamilton came district courts followed seventh circuits decision hamilton without really interpreting adea they simply followed so yes body the majority body go direction simply relied hamilton i dont think your honor i think light eeoc the statute eeoc not binding opinion in binding opinion followed language 1625 the letters opinion letters secretary  department labor  eeoc arent binding the binding your honor i would  i would ask look top commission binding opinion i think entitled chevron deference your honor i would come back  statement order fulfill requirements set forward b reasonable basis need facts thats affirmative defense dont that goes beyond simple cause action the employer could use affirmative defense defend action i  i dont understand am i understand justice oconnor dont see provision statute allows affirmative defense regulation thats correct this  outside eeoc interpreting act as know statute doesnt cover every instance does answer question would like go okay i  i would like say age discrimination act prohibition language says age court consolidated coin ruled fact one individual loses another individual within protected class doesnt matter its  whether individual loses age that  thats critical thing the your honor asking example someone might want hire congress found age 40 discrimination basis age injures individual well  may  employer may want situation want prestige someone gray hair opposed less gray hair consultant position television anchorman laughter but   requirement policy 51 older right laughter it  your honor but statute the statute prohibits discrimination basis age it simply sets protected class 40 thats argument if questions thank mr chief justice were prepared submit case,668.0,950,35,mr biggerman deal relaxed physical tests say 50 as mr verrilli mentioned flextime reduced hours people well 40  55 say  could  could 40 55 age group sue meet full physical fitness requirements cant flextime cant reduced hours so answer yes would discrimination it might defense would prohibited discrimination act make special accommodations older workers what would affirmative defense why world would bfoq you dont 55 job quite contrary special accommodations made theyre able job it doesnt fit bfoq decision i know its extraordinary applicational definition bfoq bona fide occupation qualification essential job so happens piece legislation everybody thought meant aid older workers especially towards end working careers ends harming you   cannot make special arrangements let flextime you cant make accommodations  strange consequence legislation but  exceptions statute you gave bfoq i think quite clear that wouldnt work case what else would we said would discrimination how could employer defend what statute would give employer affirmative defense to make special accommodations older workers physical fitness test shorter hours flextime thats available people 55 say but sections erisa internal revenue code allow various provisions benefit plans retirement stock option exercise forth going odds interpretation i mean whole array laws directly affected sixth circuit view affirmed now do think congress really intended result one thing  i see point  one thing everybody i think saying one form another one thing isnt covered 2 hiring firing people so every time employer dismisses person age 40 either hit lawsuit older one tries lean little backwards favor older  i dont want prejudiced favor older though i category   point every time tries sympathetic older person younger one hits lawsuit and federal courts become employment court discover instance whether cause moreover employer could possibly lean even little bit favorable towards older person thats i think saying  i would say  interpretation blow act destroy an act intended help older people suddenly become act turns federal courts labor courts deciding case anything happens person age 40 whether employer was justified now   im putting strongly i want hear i think theyre telling side i thought i articulating well  brings back answer gave justice ginsburgs question reflected justice breyers am i correct inferring answer  i dont think said quite way  justice ginsburgs hypothetical regarding flextime  physical fitness test would say violation thats i carry away  answer directly relates justice breyers concern expressed now i  i tell  currently advised seems fanciful version congress intended i would interpret statute way now i go along tell respect ambiguous statute i bound chevron mead  accord deference agencys interpretation your   people side say theres requirement do think requirement what relying the agency guideline yes do  agree description side that promulgated notice comment rulemaking yes said simply go along carter administrations request requirement even interpretive rules promulgated notice comment rulemaking even though ada require now thats actually wrote brief accurate all right if accurate would congress intended relevant pages mead use word congress one paragraph five times try figure congress wanted respect would congress wanted courts defer kind interpretive regulation taken seriously would destroy congress ends thats pretty tough question im putting  im overstating slightly i want elicit clear answers mr biggerman may i ask two questions the first question statute enacted yes i think sponsor statute secretary labor former law professor mine i think goes back quite ways well good many years ago wasnt and second question  comment sentence district courts opinion every federal court address issue held claim reverse age discrimination cognizable ada this suggests theres long history viewing statute one  one way perhaps substantial reliance interests would build period many many years would comment aspect case when case decided just shortly district courts decision well isnt true though general matter courts generally read statute way district court read but think  business community  justified relying rule good many years you think statutes clear the eeoc period continued say  worked ways didnt well question isnt whether theyre binding the question whether business community could rely i mean   guideline regulation i would say incidentally i dont know accept proposition interpretive regulations somehow different substantive regulations insofar authoritativeness concerned regulation agency saying business community opinion letter dont worry going enforce way indeed going amend regulation now know   i make far chevron deference concerned but  regulation seems internal tension inconsistency youre relying says 16252a b goes say extension additional benefits increased severance pay older employees within protected group may lawful employer reasonable basis conclude benefits counteract problems related age discrimination that seems recognition older get problems   regulation says yes give benefits not unless theres law allowing i dont see one i mean provision unless shoehorn bi section allows employer for employ  well im taking time you minutes left i dont see provision allowing affirmative defense go ahead the example thats given paper  51yearold 42yearold applying job matter one gets cant discriminate account age how could decision employ 51yearold discrimination account age what  would employers mind agebased decision how  could  could within meaning statute discrimination account age hired older person but decision hire older person could  would unique situation employer doesnt like 42yearolds well wouldnt discrimination basis age you like grayhaired people some young people gray hair theyd favor grayhaired people yeah well you could 51 still dark hair some us maybe theyre moved humanity unfortunate thing take account law so maybe want keep older person around decent thing younger person comes sues thank mr biggerman mr clement well hear very well the court  case submitted,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,405.0,695,0,mr chief justice may please court absent affirmative defense age discrimination employment act prohibits discrimination basis age members protected class limited claims brought older members class theres affirmative defense statute justice stevens let address hypotheticals i think seemingly benevolent instances using age may beguiling i think reality even benevolent uses age implicate interests concerns age act take example employer whos willing exempt employees 50 physical fitness test well first question i would ask youre willing exempt workers 50 physical fitness test physical fitness test really legitimate occupational qualification and used exclude workers 40 50 workplace justice ginsburg seems stereotypes older workers going strained cant work hard need time precisely stereotypes act designed prohibit now different worker justice ginsburg 16252b limited benefits charles shaner whos general counsel eeoc time older worker benefit protection act passed explained statutory affirmative defense would implicated remand 623f2bi simplification regulatory defense and i think act general matter recognizes benefits difficult tied issues retirement age like flexible approach necessary respect benefits but respect core employment hiring firing promotion compensation act reflects judgement stated purpose want promote employment older people basis i  i think thats right unless court i mean court  flexible view age prohibition i suppose could allow agency adopt flexible affirmative defense along lines weber let also why let also say statute specifically gives eeoc 29 usc 628 regulatory authority make exemptions i think specific concerns particular practices seem benevolent benevolent eeoc make regulatory exemption but respect seemingly benevolent 29 usc 628 its statutory appendix i believe page 4a   sweeping authority it gives eeoc authority make interpretive regulations substantive exemptions statute well i think i said  i think  act perfectly consistent idea stereotypes play role the purpose clause statute says wants promote employment older workers say wants promote employment older workers by judged ability rather age and i think reflects judgement employer age mind ability trying favor older worker going able reverse process theyre working detriment worker i  i think thats right justice breyer whats two responses justice breyer first first i think natural human instinct favor older worker would cut break worker whos company many years thats employer wants perfectly free age act say youve us 30 years 20 years going cut break to extent thats motivation purely agebased indication statutory history indication colloquy senators well colloquy ambiguous laughter justice scalia i tell justice scalia i tell the number people heard colloquy heard colloquy court relied two senators interpreting age act betts united airlines mcmann on two occasions court recognized two senators important views age act principal sponsors floor managers bill icing cake court relied senator javits criswell case but mr chief justice i dont know exact number times i know pending exemption right thats  thats promulgated there  mr chief justice one theyre working give employers greater flexibility coordinate retirement benefits medicare benefits response third circuit decision erie county case thats statutory authority thats never used justice stevens theres one time enforce full committee proceeding the decision circulated full commission binding decision commission right well handful examples go way  i think important understand respect entire universe eeoc decisions opposed department labor decisions theres one decision comes nonbenefits context apply regulation there three decisions come benefits context thats correct justice ginsburg thats exactly senate colloquy said  colloquy picked regulation binding regulation notice comment rulemaking right there would right no it said would discrimination whichever way decision went i dont think thats unusual i mean anytime title vii context employee whos fired sex race whichever way went somebody sue i  i think justice stevens could presumption stereotype older workers going better i suppose also true could situation benefits reason older worker wasnt going many benefits would get paid less justice scalia statute originally enacted protected class 40 65 i dont think fact  lower bound tells anything particular prohibition mr and i thought said well court consolidated coin case statute protecting individuals burden 40 protect over40ism it protects people protected class crystalclearly defined individuals 40 discrimination age the act doesnt care worker protected class loses younger two the act triggered whenever individual protected class loses age thank mr chief justice,209.0,368,17,mr clement justice ginsburg gave examples employment practices favor older persons i dont think theres affirmative defense am i correct isnt lets take hours certainly couldnt use claim that  maybe didnt need test the claim isnt necessarily screens older workers employer doesnt want put strain test but lets  lets move flexible hours reduced work hours going give benefits younger people within protected class 50 well  world could agency adopt 16252b allows increased benefits older workers employer show older people problems now mr clement  i want sure i answer question with respect employment practices described i correct  agreeing employer uses stereotype  reach conclusion would affirmative defense where  authority well  well  submission stereotypes  deplored prohibited act could eeoc make exemption contrary so instance employer quite honestly moved human feeling related older person act would rule all right now reason think thats congress mind reason think   really wanted respect human beings moved kinds emotions wanted prohibit helps people i thought ambiguous somewhat ambiguous who  heard colloquy i mean two people floor im really supposed get we dont really know how  much use eeoc made section 628 issue exemptions sort thing are   exemptions actually granted well may i ask may i ask similar question to extent  many enforcement proceedings eeoc commenced  enforce reverse discrimination aspect statute so  one example enforcement action in years one in  context mr clement didnt mention courts decision oconnor consolidated coin 52yearold claim relief 41yearold preferred if i understand argument  saying equally 41yearold would  claim 52yearold preferred it says colloquy well leave  leave  please go ahead it says colloquy could turn either it doesnt  clear turn either choose it could  cant whichever way went based age i still dont understand one could hire 51 discriminates 42yearolds but problem stereotype argument governments trying drive peoples minds age way trying drive peoples minds race sex things cant discriminate government doesnt try drive minds  40 under 40 perfectly okay   thoughts age you simply cannot regard statute statute directed moral disapproval  taking age account thank mr clement

district court denied relief exactly basis court appeals majority upheld respondents sixth amendment claim the court described issue whether undisclosed government monitoring respondents conversations custody violated right counsel in responding governments argument based language brewer williams suggesting form interrogation prerequisite finding massiah violation court held requirement satisfied general conversation the holding review today may perhaps best summarized following statement court appeals opinion in instant case even assume nichols obeyed instructions interrogate henry bank robbery nichols testify engaged conversation cellmate henry if association general conversation henry developed sufficient confidents nichols nichols bared excuse henry bared incriminating secrets nondisclose paid informer think interrogation within meaning brewer therefore violation massiah doctrine question law case stands unfortunately facts well developed effect happened court appeals granted summary judgment us determining mere fact nichols informant shared cell henry engaged general conversation  they granted relief without hearing held facts in words granted relief assumption fact association general conversation sufficient make violation massiah doctrine the habeas petitioner would burden proof however case conceded operative facts decision court appeals rested conceded government i think court review question whether court appeals correct saying enough grant relief now dealing issue posed case i think two different sets variables considered the first set involves manner witness came share cell defendant agreed testify trial prosecutions behalf the one extreme case like milton wainwright undercover officer posing fellow inmate deliberately placed defendant cell we dont think case turns that think would reversal either event case record stands evidence deliberately placed purpose extracting statements respondent no i dont think voice overlap  we   say could sustain decision court appeals even deliberately placed but im sure would make difference little hard we believe win even deliberately placed long kind deliberate elicitation interrogation  well id happy discuss like  i certainly direct apart situation officer put cell milton extreme uncommon situation cellmate defendant comes authorities tells defendant talking crime charged offers inform authorities defendants statements this case somewhere voice overlap  no im talking state voice overlap  there would problem would statements made thereafter there would issue statements already made now second kind variable one perhaps forefront present case concerns nature relationship interaction witness defendant again possibilities rated along spectrum at one end spectrum informant adjoining cell defendants simply overhears incriminating statements interaction whatsoever defendant at end situation milton extended calculated effort made “open defendant repeated questioning crime defendant stands charged now unless rationale underlying massiah doctrine entirely reexamined seems clear milton situation constitutes denial right counsel conversely i see absolutely nothing courts opinions subject suggest purely passive overhearing conversations defendants thirdparty defendants lawyer could properly held evade right counsel i would say would violate sixth amendment right counsel there might fourth amendment question that similar issue hearst patty hearst case ninth circuit believe that correctly decided ninth circuit well thats  i think clear speaks another convict government agent massiah issue whatsoever so im assuming hypothetical agent silent next cell prison guard walks overhears statement im talking obtaining statement absolutely act effort part government i view one polar extreme act effort open defendant intensive interrogation offense polar extreme we dont question man government well know paid point information provided thats instructed i dont know that would true no im  i think basis courts decisions suggest transmitter would violate right counsel opinion court appeals initially cast issue terms monitoring defendants conversations i dont think even decision really read hold near overhearing violates right counsel they relied also fact conversation witness informant defendant it clear however court require conversation relate way defendants case accordingly narrow question court whether general conversation sports weather neutral topics makes incriminating statements thereafter volunteered defendant cellmate inadmissible now i understand court appeals theory finding violation circumstances thereby manifesting friendliness informant create atmosphere defendant likely trust reveal incriminating information now seems plain court appeals decision cannot squared either past descriptions kind conduct massiah rule prohibits right counsel rationale rule looking first court said prohibited massiah opinion speaks deliberate elucidation now elucidation somewhat vague term clearly suggests kind drawing overcoming resistance speak least constructing artificial situation particularly likely produce desired statements massiah fact involves specific questioning defendant crime informant brewer court made quite clear interrogation something quite like touchstone finding violation right counsel no holding right counsel violated tantamount interrogation however  there case court saying theres violation circumstances court well  theres nothing mcleod suggest interrogation if go back opinion ohio court court refer statements voluntarily made i believe context reference uncoerced reference spontaneous the issue mcleod problem dealing summary disposition without opinion ohio supreme court held mcleod indicted defendant yet counsel right counsel massiah so hard tell courts reversal based well i  brady case  brady yes that unquestionably closest i think court come holding letting defendant tell facts crime violates massiah yes voice overlap no question i used word “defendant” i referring somebody voice overlap thats correct thats correct indeed they havent im almost certain  to minister  thats true well warden also agent government hes paid he works government voice overlap  well colloquial sense no im saying warden voice overlap  well let come back make point i slightly lost touch brewer hold response justice whites question its true state lost brewer also true opinion brewer makes clear extended association general conversation wideranging variety topics yet courts said ingredients alone would render williams incriminating statements actions admissible least i read statement court no constitutional protection would come play interrogation now would hardly need court brewer engage extended analysis whether “christian burial speech” constituted interrogation mere fact detective captain leaming car friendly williams enough cause statements williams made violate massiah the statement case well i  well  i  well i think dispute  well informant  dont affidavit informant record case all testimony informant trial i dont recall testimony specifically denied interrogating i find judge butzners opinion strange regard assertion petitioner 2255 petition interrogation illegal term  much ink spilled scholars brewer william dispositive case now let try address point justice stewart made turning brewer sixth amendment policies underlie right counsel principle thats involved the main stream courts sixth amendment cases starting powell alabama dealt formal judicial proceeding various stages pretrial degree formality defendant facing unfamiliar surroundings complex legal issues experienced prosecutor yes things follow indictment yes thats true well i  i agree completely cases need counsel obvious talking proceedings well id rather get involved laughter the  reasons implicating right counsel massiah setting less obvious formal judicial proceedings setting neither massiah brewer undertake detail analysis connection suppress statements role counsel would play im coming i say i think best sources understanding applicable policies concurring opinion spano courts opinion ash now ash speaks trial like confrontations i read spano opinion focuses notion extra judicial interrogation accused unquestionably spano constitutes effect pretrial trial trial outside trial invert hamlet metaphor now bringing notions bear upon present case i dont think anything association general conversation among cellmates jail remotely resembles trial type confrontation brings requirement counsel present play it seems specific questioning government agent designed elicit information offense actions statements uniquely likely draw defendant subject overcome reticence reveal knows necessary preconditions recognition right counsel basis say “yes really part trial” this critical stage prosecution standard used sixth amendment cases now true i think makes confession cellmate whos going report that critical i believe stage prosecution unless emerges proceeding way resembles trial type proceeding least thats way i read spano ash in present case record entirely consistent conclusion respondent quite willing volunteer information crime denied specific interrogation kind trick necessary draw subject accordingly i think record falls far short justifying relief recorded court appeals we dont know dont know voice overlap  excuse well i think would know i mean spin endless hypotheticals things couldve going cell ask whether would would kind trial like confrontations counsel thought justified massiah doctrine well im frankly somewhat loss sources terms courts decisions draw relatively limit terms explication concept deliberately elicited means i think  that expression massiah deliberately elicited yes although i think reference deliberately elicited well well several places topic touched upon  well except  well opinion says  i see i find place all right several places opinion refers cite approval instance judge hays dissent court appeals voice overlap  there much voice overlap deliberately elicit didnt say deliberately elicited acquired said deliberately elicited well i mean view i confess i difficulty evaluating our brief addresses somewhat connection right counsel right statements admitted in trying discern looking sources explained best i come understanding notion going outside trial characteristics sufficiently resemble trial lawyer and i dont think sitting  i dont think jail house banter weather kinds things  it different sense would issue admissibility statements government agent its clear  well i think position nothing  well difficulty alternative seems push principles logical extreme difficulty drawing line end situation simply cant overhear defendant i mean suppose  well i understand government stop investigating crime defendant indicted well thats voice overlap   massiah brewer held we cant take ask questions case talking four five cellmates cell norfolk jail voice overlap  well  well usually time indictment although often cases evidence would helpful getting accurate outcome trial let turn second point one minute time short question scope agency informant i want make one point here mr nichols jail knew past experiences i expect people jail cells probably know provide information would helpful prosecution one cellmates could expect kind consideration information i think fairly clear nichols talked agent coughlan simply expectation would probably get something listened though saddler come forward afterwards would issue case massiah violation yet nichols agent communicate result communication really impart new information nichols fbi would like confessions henry makes nichols knew impose constraints way nichols behaves to tell nichols look scrupulous regard sixth amendment rights defendant yes seems agent certainly acting scrupulously the government talking  well talking excluding  i cant say im  he told question i mean one issues would raise  yes and dont know questioned that issue case id like reserve little time i left rebuttal theres couple points i want make clear position its informant cant open mouth it said informant cant lead defendant talk subject would otherwise talked now respect justice marshalls question professor geltner i think quite clearly view could send somebody bar listen expect make statements bar crime could use statements without violating massiah our motive acquire information view clearly enough court unless something constitutes elicitation us court led seems extreme position extreme position defensible right counsel rationale i hear professor geltner explain right counsel implicated listening post kind situation the concept interrogation  okay,488.0,636,50,well hear arguments next united states henry mr frey i think may proceed do think basically question fact law well dont mean technical sense court appeals granted summary judgment has court ever held burden proof federal habeas action do think  case turns whether deliberately placed got so decide case assumption among things deliberately placed voice overlap made difference make voice overlap   voice overlap  right i thought thats well massiah didnt require interrogation are going direct well latter case thats informed authorities statements voice overlap   made wouldnt government  i understand what would say placing transmitter right cell person transmitter when say third party draw distinction third party paid government third party another convict speak but question man government agent voice overlap and paid and paid listening asking questions and i assume said ask questions wouldnt paid well didnt ask questions hed like hed passive role like transmitter bug wouldnt but said transmitter would alright well holding think by interrogation interrogation but didnt  something  case i guess case wouldnt saying violation interrogation there interrogation massiah it certainly wasnt mcleod ohio there another summary reversal even clear interrogation wasnt whats name brady well person whos indicted isnt voice overlap indictment not suspect somebody indicted and goes back concurring opinions spano new york and none opinions case court ever held defendant simply blurts warden jail confined i want get chest i want tell happened thats inadmissible isnt can find anyway blurted minister either way this paid government informant and paid government informant recognize different warden is paid government informer is paid voice overlap government informer you dont hes legal stoolie is statement defendant conversation reality form interrogation disputed categorically anywhere voice overlap yes no im referring concurring opinion judge butzner says nevertheless absent testimony informant suggested hearing district judge issue absent testimony informant said defendant judgment must reversed informants admission conversed defendant defendants assertion conversation form questioning   disputed does informant dispute point well voice overlap informant and thats generally follows indictment isnt in system administration   criminal law person indicted followed formal judicial proceedings open courtroom sorts constitutional rights counsel confrontation voice overlap  voice overlap  open public presided judge the courtroom isnt always open public course well read final paragraph spano case  well drawn what what drawn interrogation  there questions used certainly low languages drawn elicited interrogated conceive use ordinary dictionary sense word conceive words representing various places along spectrum described that word massiah i gather and brewer interrogated well quote massiah can tell us facts massiah case gleaned record district court court appeal perhaps trial court far review opinion court facts massiah case less conversation massiah supposed friend werent voice overlap car wired sound no im  yes im talking far facts viewed massiah case  court wasnt much review it given massiah indicted supposed friend fact government agent government agent deliberately elicited acquired information massiah sitting front seat car new york voice overlap  well  whats  well  jail house banter isnt little bit different one bantering parties contingent prearrangement government bantering elicits information gets paid doesnt get paid it clear informer  informant motive elicited information and fact received information fact paid the missing link exactly get its hard draw constitutional line suggesting giving lot conversation sooner later draw statement square questioning its easy draw line somebody contact government didnt motive  well stop taking asking questions least much   voice overlap  generally voice overlap man indictment within custody unless pretty  case pretty well made would this jail bird stoolie pigeon talk scrupulous laughter i know man testify is true admitted question wouldnt get paid well wasnt told question would paid and paid and paid mr gletner i think point mr frey thank gentlemen case submitted,1211.0,1757,29,mr chief justice may please court in view court appeals perfectly correct view law handling case given peculiar procedural history if look procedural history say first fact trial testimony mr nichols came jury without knowledge excuse part defense mr nichols informant deficiency development record way mr henry interacted the issue squarely put first motion vacate district judge dismissed without hearing the court appeals remanded district judge opinion explained district judge facts find district judge rather holding evidentiary hearing wrote letter prosecutor indicating believe matter could disposed without necessity public hearing advised agents request mr nichols sabbath interview henry probably grant hearing at point affidavit agent coughlan comes forward says advised mr nichols initiate conversations regard bank robbery question mr henry now light i think easy understand court appeals saw question whether record adequate outright reversal conviction whether contrary made sense remand one time evidentiary hearing and mind id like going take look record i believe record strongly supports conclusion court appeals correct matter interpret massiah decision we know record bank robbery occurred 28th august 1972 date mr moore mr locke arrested charged crime on 22nd september complaint sworn agent ohara supervising agent charge investigation indicates time case mr henry consisted fbis knowledge participated rental house wales avenue norfolk mr moore mr locke arrested no quite contrary your honor the court appeals saw question whether conviction set aside whether hearing would filled record interaction mr henry mr nichols necessary yes your honor precisely point summary record establish record quite adequate support conclusion as i saying complaint sworn september case mr henry consisted evidence connected rental house mr moore mr locke found on 8th november warrant turned atlanta georgia 10th november mr henry arrested atlanta georgia on 15th november mr henry indicted charged crime on 21st november 1972 period transit mr henry arrived norfolk put norfolk city jail at time tell record i think record clearly establishes governments case still consisted evidence participant rental hideout on 21st november agent ohara visits mr henry norfolk city jail interrogates finally mr henry refuses answer questions according agent ohara mr  testimony transcript page 106 mr henry stated would like answer general questions regards activities afraid would change answers around on day without case ive already laid day mr coughlan tells us affidavit agent coughlan said went visit mr nichols norfolk city jail time gave instructions regard mr henry although affidavit agent coughlan tells us placed limitations wanted mr nichols also tells us advised mr nichols bank robbery bank robbery charge mr henry agency interested getting statements bank robbery it quite clear even believe mr  agent coughlans affidavit nuances quite clear put mr nichols notice precisely wanted on 27th november mr henry appeared court arraignment  first court appearance know record morning appeared without counsel judge mckenzie judge mckenzie asked wanted counsel said judge mckenzie appointed counsel there recess taken mr henry arraigned afternoon appeared court the next thing record tells us sixth december agent coughlan visited nichols nichols told information obtained mr henry the information essentially information testified trial get agent coughlans affidavit now  talking period time 21st november sixth december majority period nichols henry others jail together now look nichols trial testimony admittedly laid  admittedly result specific questioning happened nichols henry nevertheless see conversations occurred henry nichols quite directed related quite specifically crime question he arraigned counsel appointed 27th november that appears  appears record page 1 joint appendix the second reference november 28th court proceedings jam judge mckenzie that november 27th 28th the appendix error i checked the appendix error the record indicates docket sheet record indicates november 27th the entry immediately november 27 cja 20 appointment voucher counseling services so date appointment counsel time middle period jail interrogation eliciting obtaining whatever occurred indictment preceded entire period falling november 15th the nichols conversations henry   jail cell occurred sometime 21st november   sixth december all post indictment  that much clear im sure your honor aware case interpreting  cases court interpreting massiah involved counsel plus indictment involved simple indictment massiah brewer involved counsel plus indictment voice overlap mccloud  yes brewer involve   formal charge yet  indictment yet counsel case formal charges filed in mccloud statement obtained indictment counsel came case thats likewise true brady case brady fifth circuit decision yes your honor id happy address in hoffa case face three issues fourth amendment question self incrimination question right counsel question on right counsel question seems hoffa case turns proposition evidence obtained hoffa undercover agent partin used another case information obtained four years case court time massiah by i mean court remember your honor hoffa trial something referred opinion test fleet trial mr partin came see undercover role awaiting trial period trial the testimony partin gave court testimony jury tampering trial resulted part information developed on sixth amendment question seems case turns court  courts opinion see reference part massiah opinion said  says crucial question whether information pending case elicited used pending case with regard hearst hearst course relates mr chief justice burgers question placement listening device the ninth circuits opinion hearst turns fact listening device listening device generally available used jail purpose monitoring security matters the statement made agent listening device placed purpose obtaining information pending case that accident according opinion ninth circuit hearst i prefer rest point distinction voice overlap   thats sufficient distinguish case no your honor i think government must attempt obtain information pending case somebody indictment pending thats makes violation unconnected case in example your honor warden waiting office mr henry goes says “id like confess today” the fact – warden government employee opinion make violation massiah if warden anybody else procured attempt get mr henry seems makes violation massiah i think i agree mr frey your honor that violation massiah right government obtaining information voice overlap   accused voice overlap   the word put well i think probably reach voice overlap point  i think i still agree mr frey thats case government agent the  point government makes somebody agent seeks bidding put obtain information voice overlap  thats right precisely your honor yes sir the listening post  same case your honor i think thats violation   right counsel if agent went purpose yes your honor if somebody else sitting bar happens turn testifies  i think thats warden justice rehnquists example  thats im summarizing facts your honor i think thats right i think thats pointed opinions brewer essentially factual inquiry i think mr justice blackmuns opinion brewer points subjective intention agent important cases of course your honor voice overlap thats precisely i going   recitation record i reason one reasons request court take look testimony mr nichols  precisely mine i think thats import judge butzners opinion voice overlap  well  well judge winters opinion majority opinion mr butzners occurred says “if association general conversation henry developed sufficient confidence nichols henry bared incriminating secrets violation  it either judge winters opinion   either judge butzners opinion placed greater emphasize opinion fact record indicates conversations nichols henry conversation subject bank robbery voice overlap  he sir the fourth circuits opinion i think i  i think thats fair reading i indicating i think read record well fairly on page 134 transcript first page nichols testimony mr nichols asked question “did opportunity conversations henry jail” conversations talking somebody sat listening post i think thats correct i think particularly judge winters opinion uses either association general conversation i think either i think judge winters opinion means either enough i think judge butzners opinion place terms either i think record doesnt require i think thats probably important thing decision today the record require i want court understand position my position efforts government obtain information use pending trial pending indictment violation right counsel unless suitable waiver voice overlap   voice overlap happened case  excuse your honor unless suitable waiver unless counsels present yes i your honor yes sir i think would terrific fourth amendment problem question voice overlap   need address six amendment question and i think thats hearst i think position position hearst purpose something obtain information use pending cases people right counsel violation if purpose general security measures example i think that i concede thats violation right counsel then i think weve got something like brewer we possibility waiver i think implicit opinions brewer case possible somebody right counsel indictment formal ever certain settings wave voice overlap we might waiver we might waiver yes yes as opinions particular concurring  dissenting opinions brewer indicate wherever question always close question cases somebody known police officer seems always easy question you cant find waiver weve got undercover informant now your honors i wanted take bit time point mr nichols testimony strongly testimony supports particularly judge butzners concurring opinion court appeals i thought thats i any government  any information obtained government agent seeks obtain information use   pending trial why go if went voice overlap   obtain information  in bar room hypothetical if fbi agent went get drink happened mr henry came along made incriminatory statements in position is violation right counsel the government done anything obtain evidence  im sorry your honor id must confused answer i thought warden what saying your honors look page 135 transcript question “did mr henry tell anything bank robbery” now “tell” means got conversation two bank robbery perhaps questioning conversation “would relate jury told you” point mr nichols tells jury substance admissions attributes mr henry further page 136 transcript question mr nichols “did give reason going bank” people give reasons things engaged conversation subject nowhere hear questions answers mr nichols tells us “i overheard henry bragging prisoners” i think your honor must assume mr inaudible prepared witness knew witnesses story wanted get jury accurately if i  i prosecutor case advised fbi agents witness man listening post seems question i wouldve asked “did ever hear anything youre cell mr henry” we dont see question dont see i think assume totally record reflects facts described prosecutor  either agents voice overlap  the case completely turn court cares  crucial courts decision whether overhearing oppose efforts draw defendant act seems record supports conclusion and finally page 137 use word “described” questions answers “tell” seems leave conclusion although believe proper reading massiah decision two pre curiums brewer government may formal adversary proceedings seek obtain information accused without respecting right counsel find whats tantamount interrogation case circumstances jail cell got adequate record support court appeals thank your honors,451.0,636,35,mr geltner let ask one question referring statement made couple moments ago whether court appeals shouldve remanded another hearing district court treated first remand way youre suggesting present decision review remanded habeas petition another hearing right well assumed resolved doubts favor government nonetheless set conviction aside mr geltner i understand theres question henry indicted say hed arraigned counsel appointed that appears somewhere was appendix error and nichols conversations take place sometime 15th voice overlap yes yes so  all post indictments voice overlap the massiah brewer invited  involved counsel indictment plus counsel indictment voice overlap indictment charge kind counsel massiah voice overlap  you know know  brady jurisdiction brady mr geltner comment hoffa hearst cases latter dont cite formal one describing dissenting opinion mr geltner  where draw line spectrum mr frey referred would think person indictment jail volunteering confession warden violation massiah so totally voluntary confession effect someone employ government violate massiah well unconnected case i dont know exactly  well cellmate isnt government agent time interrogates finds turns quite willing testify government knows people knew get break never put purpose well   perhaps policy prison warden government people  people favor get favor well word seeps wall then i suppose government agent put cell mute couldnt speak okay could listen i suppose youre still making argument put elicit and wouldnt make different believes whether said word interrogated anybody hed passive person like passive electronic voice overlap  except one man bail hes indicted counsel bail prosecutor gets one guidance hangs bar 8th street go see bragging  what you mean public bar bragging yes and agent happened hear cant talk but suppose goes brags fbi agent getting drink didnt go purpose you think warden voice overlap  thats factual inquiry isnt intent government employee approaches defendant so suppose disagree submission passive listening agent wouldve  would violate right counsel lose case voice overlap  yes what think think court appeals answer question would so think  think said theres violation passive listening would violate right counsel if said im sure went answered question brought answer and thats agreeing passive listening enough agent yes yet concurred judge winters opinion do think limitation narrow thrust courts opinion which hes indicating agrees limitations expressed concurring opinion but  mr geltner say record wouldve supported narrower opinion effect court appeals wrote i take page 7 petition language referring judge winters opinion says “even assumed nichols obeyed instructions interrogate henry bank robbery testify engaged conversation certainly dont go much beyond purely passive listening find violation massiah and draw line voice overlap  go ahead and draw line whether pursuant arrangements made advance distinguished something develops event in words arrangements made advance listening post agent theyre made advance ordinary informant like witness prosecution mr geltner lets assume congress passed statute requiring listening device placed cells federal prisons operated 24 hours day would think would valid voice overlap what i need problem yes i take position would different agent case cellmate said way whether ignored im government agent but  agent cellmate ever said “by way government asked report thing inaudible asked report i promise report everything ever say” shuts never says another word fellow sooner later tells something thats incriminating might voice overlap waiver  but except would except youd make argument now youre really going try win case laughter inaudible question  do go far indictment counsel appointed information obtained government agent cannot voice overlap   circumstances voice overlap i dont mean seeks guy standing voice overlap i said fbi agent went get drink thats i said hypothetical voice overlap  yes  yes i thought said  well overseen transcripts examination witnesses realize colloquial expressions frequently used eliciting testimony trials so case turns use word “tell” opposed

type attachment issue attachment used provide wireless telecommunications services the fcc determined natural reading act requires types attachments covered the operative provision basic coverage provision defines pole attachment attachment cable television system provider telecommunications service inaudible in appendix petition certiorari right end the language im talking page two hundred five a inaudible im sure brief also app separately set forth appendix inaudible but  sect section im referring section two twentyfour a four it says term pole attachment means attachment cable television system provider telecommunications service pole duct conduit rightofway owned controlled utility inaudible i think right i think use term particular cable television system part cable television system could reasonably construed mean the network of devices used provide cable television system service people i think thats correct i think probably thing true telecommunications telecommunications pr provider telecommunications services okay the fcc hasnt reached conclusion yet fcc concluded i think la natural reading statute leads conclusion well attachment attachment thats used provide cable television system service fact used cable television system fact also used something else doesnt exclude attachment act if still well would still act well i i wouldnt quite say okay but it i i wouldnt quite put way that page eighty best place start eightyseven a paragraph thirtythree forth no no i dont think reason no jurisdiction right rate issue the the court appeals did address i dont even think presented court appeals proper rate apply yes theoretically could it theoretically could neither dont i i dont think thats correct i i think agency clear jurisdi basis jurisdiction a four basic coverage provision act could it said all right then no all right i agree the you infer youre right you infer agency said said could d c dont decide whether a whether internet access part a provision a cable service cable service covered terms d okay quite but i i think agency quite clear pinned decision theyre else question whether d question right rate mr feldman saying fcc think th point is a even almost probably possible reading statute certainly one fcc fcc adopted contrary one thats right thats correct and i i would i would i i dont think thats right whet whether agency says d fact a four covers issues realize that iss issue seems difficult one i go but cable thought well congress thought the result of true could e rate might apply thing would still e rate applied system it may something else well and i think determined time if turned additional addition internet access meant neither cable telecommunications ser service that additional service neither neither fcc would figure reasonable rate would so could charge its possible fcc could fcc didnt statute no question put forth cable said i dont want justify decision fcc decided that wouldnt would want it decided hybrid like inaudible yes yes i think congress wanted specify said cable wanted ensure and actually fairly clear cable companies went the business providing telephone service people would ha charged rate telecommunications providers newly added act but thats would it seems if true could lead conclusion fccs choice rate wrong maybe chosen e rate rate i think that issue preserved eleventh circuit would jurisdiction determine right rate look what fccs reasoning whether know the various conclusions fcc reached coming d rate mr chief justice may please court its pa well attachment cable television system pole system defined set closed transmission paths associated signal generation reception control equipment designed provide cable services include video programming

lets assume fcc determines telecommunications a hybrid cable right hybrid pure cable im wondering jurisdiction pure internet i question possibly charge hybrid theyre theyre theyre theyre saying even though section says charge rate cable going say charge rate cable plus internet if ignore the doctrine inclusio unius exclusio alterius say rates cable and fcc come said also rates cable little strange mr feldman i understand argument reverse eleventh circuit say fcc jurisdiction would go would await ongoing rulemaking determine category would something eleventh amendment remand say

right yeah ejusdem generis principles phrase wires cables associated equipment associated equipment subordinate words precede delimited two words the definition utility its section two two four d two page two oh eight a youve got okay equipment two things pole right its got right i i and i think also one last quick point on wireless rooftop say yes correct that thats ar thats governments argument inaudible this fccs und fccs reading statute impermissible u read whole statute they decided take revolutionary expansion jurisdiction regulate tiny piece wireless siting market statute well the statue a a b correct right thats correct from perspective but thats indeed wh theyve done com phone company exempted statute they poles indeed right i i know understand question well lets talk jurisdictional language the jurisdictional language broad may appear it doesnt include yes also doesnt include comingled cable internet service well congress talked sort sides u mouth internet shops well in indeed indeed cable companies correct but cable companies are mom pop shops anymore biggest companies united states l l let answer yes comes definition cable system youre arguing well im im arguing is entirely well youre youre unregulated unregulated if gets internet business gets put footing youre local phone company whatever whatever utility wants charge right for cable tremendous it gives gives rate regulations yes so two big competitors business local phone company unregulated cable company seeking regulation about eighty eightyfive percent poles owned utility companies fifteen twenty percent owned telephone co indeed the i think relevant comparison would many phone company putting putting you charge phone company less youre charge correct indeed indeed im wrong indeed

mind do r read saying provided attachment used either d e purpose thats so exclusive uses and i mean far i read d e address a typical important regulatory problem were were the dont if characterize b right way inaudible whereas areas within special expertise cable specified rates odd congress giving regulatory authority reasonable regulatory agency taking two areas happens industry particularly interested negotiating specific formula leaving others times ive seen thousand times regulatory statutes leaving others agency proceed normal ordinary reasonable rate setting authority yes lets go narrow theyre talking attachments utility poles its narrow aspect utilities overall operations well thats assumption two kinds rates formulas two relates rates fixes rates requires access detailed

wireless so couldnt wireless boxes nail these poles pole attachment deemed associated equipment wires use elsewhere associated wires cables can tell term associated equipment section ive got given given fact somebody pointed i guess justice scalia pointed earlier wireless companies always wires wire yeah yeah sites used utility sites owned utility companies mandatory carriage wire of of

telecommunications didnt say would treated d going use rate congress specifies in d say is poles well i thought purpose im really asking question i want hear argument main point case different youve already said all right jurisdictional language broad narrowing language picks two categories rate setting toasters doesnt include billboards i agree well theres awkwardness i dont understand fetter internet in thats read legislative history anything indicates congress wanted take benefit away cable systems also offering internet access lower rate anymore youre arguing youre pole anything want and thats price getting internet cable system advantage is main competitor local phone many poles local phone companies own relation the utilities youre representing effect justice ginsburg talking

that court reversed judgment superior court state california county santa clara convicting respondent case dante carlo ciraolo marijuana cultivation felony state this case provides opportunity court consider fourth amendment issue relating aerial observation important tool used number states well federal government detect locate marijuana cultivation throughout country california contends warrant

navigated air traffic flight line san jose california airport without visual optical aids officers observed back yard 15by25foot marijuana garden composed according officers affidavit plants described full approximately eight ten feet tall  the officers aircraft took photograph they later obtained search warrant seized total 73 cultivated marijuana plants the respondent ciraolo pled guilty trial court unsuccessfully moving suppress evidence resulting aerial observation permitted california law appealed denial motion suppress court appeals in reversing appellate court held aerial observation unreasonable search fourth amendment california supreme court denied hearing the ultimate issue case companion case dow whether ciraolo expectation privacy aerial observation garden society prepared recognize reasonable our position case straightforward when persons property concealed public view fact possession private property public view sense private hence subject fourth amendment protection ciraolos garden whatever else one say knowingly exposed scrutiny observation identification literally anyone aircraft around property in case your honor wouldnt matter open field it wouldnt matter curtilage no my answer your honor ciraolos yard and short answer you take various definitions the one believe useful area immediately surrounding home extends domestic activities household may need necessarily enclosed within fence if see view see greenhouse sure take pictures reason and and persuade marijuana able get warrant to photography case your honor asking specifying focusing photography officer indistinguishable case officer looking airplane saw stenographer said i going describe oath right i looking to controlled courts decision jacobson you controlling risk misdescription yes one attorneys one attorneys prior case your honor said california case right there california case worth well california case think wrong my view lots ways handling kind problem the constitution doesnt necessarily constitutionalize faa regulations it seems might well remedies injunction action i suspect hovering 20 feet got strong case may well i saying cort ever presented situation probably would first look question whether realistically better ways adapting controlling kind abuse i dont mean say way cops going around hovering 25 feet i saying fourth amendment respond fact remedies dont necessarily constitutionalize something every time somebody says gee really seems offensive the fourth amendment mind imposes limits expectations privacy people society prepared recognize in case in view would turn feeling would your honor and reason context case dont people going around infrared devices shooting windows we airplanes we people use airplanes reason look ground including fenced yards so seems foreseeability aspect may well cross line the infrared problem may well that may enough violate fourth amendment i saying whatever technology exists police use i saying dealing something routine i use word purposely i understand mr ciraolos position court public see yard it police see routinely that okay cant view think got marijuana reasonable suspicion thinking yes yes i think ladder situation hook ladder situation foreseeability problem i think i stated brief your honor mind reason knothole ladder hypothetical causes problem precisely homeowner taken means protect kind intrusion talking for example knothole situation guy really question maintain fence observation made that seems to quite different question take protections ciraolo saying doesnt that seems to categorically different question as far ladder concerned i go back proposition ordinarily situation person walk hotel lobby i morning saw sitting aerial photography washington including pictures fenced residential yards i think different situation saying police go take hook ladder truck stair fence i mean putting aside quite aside physical invasiveness difference i think probably if exposed air space cant good tree well case your honor case officer look wasnt using yes well knothole question mind mind lot permutations did know tree partially exposed it like knothole does someone take extreme measures see well answer knothole many cases i foresee perfectly legitimate if i walking sidewalk i turn head i see hole wall i see plant marijuana plant i dont consider violation fourth amendment before i going say violation i going ask lot questions like purpose hole some holes fences seeing i mean give hole look fence i would want know officer step sidewalk well draw distinctions respond peoples foreseeabilities foreseeability situations and doesnt bother say people dont expect police put ladder fence say time policeman walking sidewalk left hole like fence turns head sees marijuana plant act that distinction doesnt bother in view ciraolo cannot claim expectation recognized society members public see marijuana garden police may could legitimately claim redhaired people see marijuana garden aircraft brownhaired people what fourth amendment cur view permits police enter area publicly accessible certainly navigable air space area may see normally exposed view yes i suspect court would spend halfpage citing decision karo in fact i think mention parabolic microphones officer marches street doesnt parabolic microphone wont violate constitution starts aiming routinely randomly anybodys house focused way someones house specifically going violate sure exploitation technology home threatening invokes fourth amendment protections i think brings your honor i understand ciraolos core contention case statement oliver distinction open fields curtilage implies curtilage warrants fourth amendment protections attach home that statement i believe made lead opinion i think ciraolo asking court read statement meaning distinction curtilage open field implies level expectations home attached curtilage that statement said it said protections fourth amendment the level privacy expected home i submit different level privacy outside curtilage custom habit want highest level privacy retire home it seems order know protections attach curtilage one know level protection attaches home court new question that answered katz seems katz controls case the statement around case seems revolve like moon around earth person knowingly exposes public even home office subject fourth amendment protection but seeks preserve private even area accessible public may protected now mind doesnt take lawyer figure court saying i mean responds something understand know it responds realities life if keep something public view home curtilage fact individual may means observing mean government necessarily without justification but public see virtue placed it doesnt matter home yard doesnt matter hoped would secret government disclosed there privacy interest advanced protecting observation entirely visible everyone including officer could acted private citizen observed thing i think contention accepted case ciraolos arguments far fences acting roofs badge expectation far focus argument i expect police look yard routinely i dont expect look reasonable suspicion rest arguments seem to fall wayside no your honor i going make argument i would saying i would contradicting saying police walk back yard they cant and true whether view whether fence they cant walk curtilage they cant physically trespass if see i mean i argue i arguing see naked eye air space sure take camera photograph exactly saw if see marijuana naked eye air space i dont think makes one whit difference officer camera is expectation privacy visavis aerial observation wasnt begin you didnt secret anyone from air that right you didnt secret begin you didnt privacy interest aerial observation begin therefore expectation cannot created fact officer identified marijuana takes picture show magistrate i dont understand argument i suspect might well different case yes your honor i understand i hearing previous example given justice powell i believe looking one glass buildings opaque windows using sort penetration aid visually observe well mind maybe i overly simplistic the public doesnt carry around they cant see building so maybe government shouldnt able use least without kind regulation if true right case what i saying public police see thing routinely i guess ciraolo says random patrol okay world cant they following suspicion led place it doesnt make sense i think constitutional requirement case government warrant i think requirement constitution places police quantum suspicion looking i think go navigable air space i think use eyes i think see everybody else see now may seem earthshaking proposition court ever heard i think court needs say order reverse court appeals and i urge just briefly your honor i agree one thing mr krause say case fourth amendment cases decided reality hypotheticals keeps talking seems distinction intense looking nonintense looking routine focusing life i dont understand arguments i mean i know air patrol involves air patrol involves focusing you dont look whole world airplane you look something specific go place place looking that air patrol so terms focusing i dont understand practical difference mr krause speaking the thing i wanted say tenor sound i get respondent case something really oppressive egregious perhaps subjective nonetheless i know court doesnt like listen quotes get flavor case fellows name involved officer schutz detective john schutz witness suppression hearing officer makes describing intensive scrutinizing focus we extremely busy plotting direction  we number different places go  we watch aircraft  we flight line san jose airport  and i recall plotting various locations map attempting get one point another without tying air traffic long  now i dont know i mean maybe im wrong but doesnt sound like guy airborne spy it sounds like guy wants get home wife kids your honor couldnt get warrant he didnt probable cause and question ground aircraft dont probable cause if say well know really talking marijuana dealers growers whatever say if say fence acts roof constitution build fence i mean really comes they exactly tell they adapt ways whatever appropriate get protection i mean i mean no your honor i simply mean read opinions carefully i didnt mean way thank the honorable court adjourned thursday morning 1000,320.0,425,24,we hear arguments next california ciraolo mr sullivan i think may proceed whenever ready i take curtilage aspect immaterial well isnt open field hut say open view do contest fact curtilage what understand word curtilage signify what would say large greenhouse sometimes greenhouses days cover three four acres even californias tall marijuana ten twelvefoot greenhouse would they could take pictures glass greenhouse aerial pictures and persuade someone that marijuana going get warrant actually seize mr sullivan i assume agree police officer would authorized make ground entry examination curtilage case now low level hovering helicopter examination do think distinction what view is fourth amendment violation virtue low level hovering helicopter view well perhaps dont recognize fourth amendment limits type technology enhancement ordinary powers observation police use are prepared recognize interest use infrared photography visual enhancement devices kind may i follow one justice oconnors questions she asked ground intrusion say would violate fourth amendment what police rented fire truck tall crane climbed top looked fence fourth amendment violation if test respondent grown big tree something partially totally concealed marijuana plant wanted avoid risk would entitled protection it exposed except sharpeyed police officer good sharp camera exposed ground unless get ladder i sure i understand my hypothetical i wondering saying fourth amendment protection would obtain tried didnt quite succeed concealing air what answer knothole if knothole stand ladder see bad i would like test something justice oconnors question suppose invented maybe already invented gadget aim go walls house listen conversations inside if police going walls private home recorded conversation criminal activity would violation fourth amendment without warrant mr sullivan oliver open field substantial distance residence and talking privacy protected within home the curtilage suggested oliver often considered part residential area occupied family your argument however i understand that curtilage like open field like home is argument they may photograph and would true example type residence patio back surrounded brick wall say swimming pool one part marijuana planted right beside swimming pool same rule i suppose would argument from air mr sullivan i understand argument case would different marijuana instead large plants tiny plants 1000 feet would use highpowered equipment very sophisticated order detect fact marijuana it would visible couldnt really know without camera you would distinguish case mr krause all get warrant you really mean i tell 0 generallaughter you really mean you really mean do really mean 0 generallaughter do thank thank gentlemen the case submitted i announcement the court adjourn recess tomorrow wednesday honor memory late justice stewart cases set argument tomorrow heard thursday usual time,1103.0,1456,6,mr chief justice may please court word hasnt mentioned much today warrant the warrant clause fourth amendment think extremely significant case there good reasons requiring warrant i dont need repeat court repeated katz comera karo know now exceptions warrant requirement show privacy security society never 100 percent pure 100 percent secured there always possibility matter private intimate area smoke discovered fire department come despite protestations fourth amendment sacred ground there always possibility accidental entry police acting legitimately make mistake address come home privacy invaded anything seen plain view invasion subject admission criminal court plain view police acting properly a friend breach trust tell police everything said confidence occasionally air traveler look back yard matter private would like swimming pool private activities back yard there occasional air traveler why deprive mr ciraolo privacy exceptions warrant clause why excuse police taking perfectly reasonable step taking anonymous tip information could gather appropriate police work presenting magistrate getting appropriate authority invade privacy well i dont know whether us say if didnt probable cause facts record could investigated they could determined ciraolo perhaps named another police report regard marijuana cultivation they could done innumerable things instead police decided going magistrate going authorize search mr ciraolos curtilage back yard i think kind focused aerial invasion protected area much different casual overflight state california relies case there certainly i read 100 lower federal courts curtilage sorts different opinions one case ever denies idea back yard right next someones home curtilage i think depends upon really intimate area connected house i wouldnt mind accepting mr sullivans definition gave portion argument something intimately connected house people go house they use outdoor area way use indoor area fortunate enough one right privacy way i would distinguish i would agree justice powell oliver case really distinction privacies home privacies back yard intimate area home unless give distinction if dont build fence let neighbors look waived right privacy but ciraolos case he built fence i think question within curtilage i think pressing give answer i cant give there limited curtilage what limit i dont know i would say look blackstone look common law aspect whole idea curtilage developed another name common law way it called homestall something i discovered but anyway means connected way living areas home totally devoted agricultural pursuits doesnt seem quite i would say barn house used purposes main house could curtilage impossible give exact definition i want get back focused aerial surveillance i think focus extremely important this casual overflight justices this intense look someones particular back yard someone evidence criminal activity already present minds police this situation warrant certainly possible obtain i dont know whether one would obtained it depends magistrate yes i think position would little different kind situation raises issue justice white dealt camera case impossible specific probable cause required fourth amendment i suggested circumstances routine aerial surveillance back yards intense basis going take place administrative warrant solution would seem ideal could adopted basis court adopted solution camera case one thing focused nature search the police knew mr ciraolos back yard it wasnt landing national airport might see someones back yard dont know person dont know anything person they knew mr ciraolos back yard i agree justice oconnor because focus could see ground the focus could see special circumstances air traveler because focus intensifies attention given particular back yard a routine surveillance air may may uncovered mr ciraolos agricultural endeavors we dont know there evidence along score the thing know required expert picked police trained marijuana surveillance air told marijuana suspected mr ciraolos back yard specifically directed place that focus much intense would ever get now example course police bring experts want look outside home talking curtilage court said protected area protected way home protected unwarranted entry the oliver case said joined home curtilage opposition open field i sure majority wrote opinion answer attacks dissent complaining oliver case narrowing privacy said dont narrow privacy areas really counts curtilage home now i read case say curtilage protection home if doesnt i something learn i think doesnt it doesnt completely protection nearly protection back yard place right access light air kind repose need society if fence would it would waiver it would kind thing thing justice brennan talked concurring opinion lewis case police sent informant home broadcast outside going home justice brennan said that waiver fourth amendment rights home when invite someone invite say happened home so invite public look back yard protecting waived fourth amendment rights i think kind frequency air travel talking justice oconnor i get back focus kind scrutiny i talking i talking police knowing whose back yard whatever see matter legal illegal conduct report saw happening ciraolo back yard that open anyone wants listen to talk go without warrant without permission without anything the government state arguing saying cover back yard spy we invade privacy without judicial authorization we obligation report anyone found we restrictions time place manner and way late act privacy already violated case it called norml versus mullen 608 federal supplement drug enforcement agency using helicopters actually chase young girls street actually went far helicopters hovering near outhouses blew toilet paper window 0 generallaughter they abusing expect abuse happen they could gathering evidence crime could also spying political gathering they attempting deprive us privacy back yard without limit without warrant as far curtilage justice rehnquist i think good description expect curtilage found sixth circuit en banc decision dow chemical case i hope predecessors court excuse citing opinion fine discussion curtilage far extends means american jurisprudence i think sixth circuit using distinguish dow plant perhaps reason laid heavy fine description curtilage home i think oliver discussion protection curtilage would meaningless airplane could fly say case i think mr ciraolo learn advance police going fly back yard look carefully back yard time wanted conditions i think could obtain civil injunction invasion privacy i think air space on grounds invasion privacy well i think could bivens injunction yes and i think reason i realize without i going say next i going say next well could say i think certainly without warrant situation got jumping fence situation mr sullivan agreed couldnt peak fence jumping fence putting ladder instead thinks thing taking airplane privacy invaded yes i would find objection i would think that situation ideal administrative warrant going i would say prohibitive without administrative warrant specifically look peoples property purposes criminal law violation in answer i relying focus argument i relying focus argument case now justice rehnquist i wanted say i look aerial view right innocent passage kind issue international law ships go private waters passing comes different purpose ships purpose passing territorial waters united states spy united states united states need give ship right innocent passage i think true regard plane whose sole purpose invade privacy back yard the homeowner need give police right invade that i say civil action could brought now i see difference flying putting ladder logically difference whatsoever putting ladder probably allows verify much better doesnt intrude everybody elses privacy at least put ladder see mr ciraolos back yard you dont see ten twelve back yards seen aerial surveillance the problem government i imagine appears snoopy it appears dirty business justice holmes condemned olmstead case snooping somehow elevate police 1000foot level different now 1000 feet ten times width chamber it really high it less quarter mile i see difference ladder situation in carroll case government said course privacy invasion little one it putting beeper someones home but justice white pointed government sent fbi check see whether chemicals present would course violation fourth amendment similarly violation fourth amendment obtain information sending beeper and obtained information ladder agree condemned sending airplane i think idea mr ciraolo waived right free focused aerial surveillance made specific purpose gathering criminal evidence unnecessary good police work ciraolo didnt open privacy the police trying open they trying insert opener open they trying say doesnt matter purpose stray airplane might flown this hypothetical situation doesnt decide fourth amendment cases fourth amendment cases decided realities footnote carroll case footnote 4 hypothetical possibility privacy could invaded said deprive people fourth amendment rights the warrant requirement i cant see could frustrate police purpose it would prevent arbitrary intrusion privacies life the words katz case justice stewart wrote what person knowingly exposes public exposed  i think word knowingly important mr ciraolo knowingly expose back yard then justice stewart went say but seeks preserve private even area accessible public may constitutionally protected  that there atmosphere security your honors necessary freedom treasure threatened case would parabolic microphones satellite surveillance great detail this case foot door this whole monster let loose control police our citizens seen ants airplane people need repose privacy free people the fourth amendment submit protects shroud darkness government attempting place upon case thank you,167.0,264,13,i suppose answer didnt probable cause is limit view may constitute curtilage around residence space how big no limit suppose given enormous profits drug business someone takes two acres four acres builds wall entirely around tall ceiling room is private is curtilage mr krause i detect anything brief position would little different routine police patrol air i sure i understand focus argument suppose concerned ground search police reasonable suspicion drug dealing certain house they required go warrant they instead choose make focused examination exterior premises make stakeout take time want determine situation so isnt thing true examination air no could seen routine patrol why cant focus air well protected from entry ground i dont think court said i think question i dont think court said certainly oliver didnt say all said curtilage different open field it didnt say entitled protection house yes wouldnt show protection fence it would still curtilage well day age frequency air travel may well dont put patio cover back yard waive right aerial look on grounds mr krause you mean federal constitutional well would assume fourth amendment violation but trying decide i mean doesnt help argument trying convince us fourth amendment violation say could also fourth amendment violation get bivens action civil injunction would dirty hands problem the government interfering violation law but i correct understanding would find objection police routine matter sent officer every day fly 1000 feet look plants i understand would think administrative warrant isnt course isnt even mentioned warrant clause apart warrant say that would would prohibitive say prohibitive relying focus argument do anything mr

Bormes,9.0,0.0,1,1241.0,2413,24,thank mr chief justice may please court this courts decisions long established congress deemed waived governments sovereign immunity unequivocally expresses intent there statutes justice sotomayor of course well would two features consistent courts decisions found tucker act applicable one would statute contain remedial mechanism second would substantive obligations statute run united states united states alone and example type statute one court found supported tucker act white mountain apache tribe mitchell ii those kinds statutes i think tucker act meant apply well course it theyre dealing statute like and course reason addressing tucker act immunity tucker act immunity basis jurisdiction case according reasoning federal circuit and problem reasoning federal circuit allows litigant readily circumvent courts strict test sovereign immunity waivers straight forward device adding tucker act jurisdictional basis complaint and clear plaintiff couldnt claim statute including statute court would already concluded unequivocal expression test standard test applied waivers sovereign immunity satisfied now give court concrete example lane v pena court concluded rehabilitation act claims section 504 rehabilitation act unequivocal expression intent waive sovereign immunity congress purposes damages claims therefore damages claim cant brought united states section 504 but federal circuits approach apparent reason plaintiff couldnt bring damages claim united states violation section 504 rehabilitation act adding tucker act jurisdictional bases complaint because plaintiff able notwithstanding courts decision lane v pena result would plaintiff could say federal circuit look statute ask question whether fairly interpreted mandate payment money government there unequivocal expression intent waive sovereign immunity doesnt detract ability federal circuit conclude statute nonetheless fairly interpreted mandate payment money now course issue arise would make argument statute cant read but possibility plaintiff could make argument notwithstanding courts decision lane v pena think reinforces need conclude  conclude tucker act cant applied way federal circuit sought apply sure well i think one  one way look flsa looking first instance would conclude flsa waiver sovereign immunity and wouldnt look tucker act basis waiver sovereign immunity would look flsa way think look fcra  excuse fair credit reporting act fcra now your honor correct body court claims jurisprudence doesnt necessarily view statute way but apply framework think correct one apply set forth brief might reach conclusion fair labor standards act although slightly different route well would depend there little bit anomaly flsa flsa doesnt necessarily point particular court basis jurisdiction right it says in federal state court competent jurisdiction  statute specifically allows claims brought district courts court competent jurisdiction so one way well i think one way potentially see difference  im going quibble  your honors saying one way potentially see difference flsa refers courts competent jurisdiction  doesnt freestanding provision reversed district courts  possible read statute essentially incorporating tucker act setting forth court competent jurisdiction would here 1681p set forth 13a 14a appendix governments brief speaks specifically actions brought fcra appropriate united states district court goes talk court competent jurisdiction so thats potential basis drawing distinction two sure i your honor the text tucker act true read text apply full potential reach argument would difficult text tucker act never read way including court starting nichols v united states well i guess sure i guess  read tucker act full textual reach i think would difficult case but argument statute refers claims founded act congress never intended apply literally conceivable act congress and fact courts test money mandating  money mandating test applies tucker act embodies understanding were appealing were certainly relying justice scalia youre asking whether tucker act used basis waiving sovereign immunity claims fair credit reporting act so bring fair credit reporting act play yes absolutely relying specific versus general proposition court relied number cases i guess i understood justice kagans question talking tucker act tucker act alone without bringing play statute now i take your honors point hard conceive tucker act kind isolated fashion usually youll asking question whether claim brought united states statutory regime and statutory regime includes remedial mechanism fcra hard avoid resort specific control general proposition but point construing text tucker act alone tucker act waiver sovereign immunity so canon construe waivers sovereign immunity strictly comes play construe terms tucker act and i think stands reason apply canon wouldnt read tucker act encompass fully act congress implications waivers sovereign immunity would quite substantial and court never construed tucker act way shouldnt countenance kind construction effectively federal circuits interpretation allows rather applying strict standard congress would seen unequivocally expressed intent waive governments sovereign immunity terms fcra allows plaintiff avoid simply resorting tucker act jurisdictional basis complaint getting real act federal circuits description standard applies tucker act well i guess responses justice ginsburg first question whether united states subject substantive obligations fcra i dont know thats theres one size fits answer i think youd go provision provision make assessment and reason i would say respect certain provisions least statutes depending provision specific obligation government and im thinking particular debt collection improvements act privacy act certain contexts as  ask question whether respect particular fcra provision thats alleged run united states would better basis finding united states obligations statute speaks specifically question so im resisting notion fcras references person substantive obligations would necessarily encompass government now theres least one provision dont deny government covered thats 1681bb provision set forth pages  page 7a appendix governments brief and respect particular provision issue case truncation provision i guess dont confront question whether government bound provision it might well dont confront question government acts compliance provision theres series network agreements government entered credit card companies allow government participate credit card system as condition 1681bb if look well im sorry it starts 4a and  4a permissible purposes government reports conditions furnishing and go 7a  thats also part bb  bb4 exception national security investigations and talks bb4a case agency department united states government seeks obtain use  and theres reference united states government provision stands reason term “ person ” bb  starts 4a excuse  encompass united states government i guess short answer justice ginsburg i dont think one size fits answer but part question taking position even substantive obligations run united states still wouldnt remedy least remedy damages united states and answer yes but thats atypical courts sovereign immunity jurisprudence atypical congress fashioned scheme runs way and privacy act least one example privacy act applies government government alone certain obligations government comply statute but congress careful cabin circumstances government would subject liability money damages i think respect justice scalia i think thats distinction ultimately doesnt make difference context case in prior cases court applied specific general canon related contexts true statutes situations contemplated liability united states  statute would certain limitations and im thinking example hinck erika brown v general services administration cases like sheehan and court said statute provides liability united states certain situations dont look different statute tucker act circumvent kinds limitations well i guess  i dont think need negative implication full extent order invoke specific versus general canon question end day congress intend and congress enacts specific remedial scheme sets extent liability imposed case fair credit reporting act stands reason congress would expected courts look remedial scheme established determine metes bounds liability general default provision and therefore sense specific remedial scheme thats statute control general scheme congress might well mind set forward terms claims brought fcra if statute general i think i would i think context congress would made determination scope liability claims statute it would given thought issue would set forth general provision metes bounds liability and congress i think instance wouldnt expected anyone look tucker act congress gave indication thinking tucker act now your honors hypothetical statute spoke kinds general terms course wed i think good argument would contemplation waiver sovereign immunity so would strongly resist notion united states might fall within compass general provision but question whether youd look general provision opposed tucker act i think would look general provision congress context enacting statute told everybody were defining extent liability asserted court reference general provision ought look somewhere else now one it i think and i think thats quite breathtaking proposition one congress would intended virtue tucker act well would hard square understanding way  series courts cases apply specific versus general canon i think argument could made brown v general services administration erika hinck thought subject im sorry right it  well look way mr chief justice i guess response well thats question depends depends construe tucker act i mean i think your honor correctly construing tucker acts waiver sovereign immunity apply certain limited subset acts congress and construed sufficiently limited way i suppose could live result but i think better way approach question look particular remedial scheme congress enacted scope statute and purposes questions sovereign immunity youd look particular remedial scheme ask ageold question countenanced courts decisions whether unequivocal expression intent waive sovereign immunity scope statute there  well claims contract example obviously expressed contract united states i dont know that comes statute necessarily the compensation clause that doesnt come statute comes constitution tucker act used if statute  least statute remedial scheme youd look remedial scheme statute but i think i started justice sotomayor right and i think i think  statutes like one court white mountain apache tribe one another example i could give court statute dealt payment compensation prisoners war this statute issue bell v the united states i think cited footnote 42 courts opinion bowen v massachusetts but statute specifically set forth compensation would owed prisoners war held captivity that statute remedial scheme its substantive obligation ran united states united states alone nature and tucker act i think context would step supply waiver sovereign immunity jurisdiction court federal claims and reason that statute two predicate conditions think met order even raise question whether tucker act steps i think thats i think thats right your honor id qualify one respect statute contains remedial scheme thats independent reason looking tucker act right thats right i think would look question whether sufficiently expressed waiver terms statute traditional test court applied yes would i think easier remedial scheme obviously i think also case substantive obligation generally applicable one doesnt run united states alone youd still i think want thats true i mean i guess  dont reach question whether tucker act applies statute doesnt remedial scheme obviously case fcra remedial scheme our argument would still apply and question whether reading tucker act one particular way subsets acts congress i guess one point id make money mandating test court always applied tucker act apply already presupposes doesnt apply act congress act congress moneymandating one the last sentence last thought least  maybe i try rephrase last thought courts jurisprudence already presupposes tucker act doesnt apply every act congress courts jurisprudence requires act congress money mandated so already zone tucker acts reference acts congress doesnt literally extend every conceivable act congress it extends certain acts congress and i if didnt  thats  thats  i guess  didnt remedial scheme we dont get question justice kennedy get moneymandating question remedial scheme text statute substantive obligation runs united states united states alone one doesnt generally applicable and hard conceive question abstract question whether statute money mandating specifically contemplates payment money united states precisely statute generally applicable i think would say statute money mandating money mandating doesnt contemplate payment united states relevant specificity substantive obligation generally applicable you get question context like white mountain apache tribe mitchell ii substantive obligation runs united states united states alone remedial scheme embedded within statute and ask question whether kind substantive obligation runs united states one thats naturally conceived money mandating and i think would look couple considerations consistent courts decisions one is obligation one necessarily deals compensation so example statute i referring earlier compensation imprisoned prisoners war one naturally compensation might money mandating in white mountain apache tribe trust cases arise indian tucker act court concluded background principles trust law would necessarily contemplate payment money statutes money mandating but principal point get question get past hurdle well right but i think moneymandating test justice sotomayor whether contemplates payment damages united states and i guess thats im hard time addressing question abstract predicate condition hasnt satisfied that question naturally arises substantive obligation runs united states united states alone i think precisely reason your honor says substantive obligation generally applicable applies parties beyond united states hard ask question whether statute money mandating relevant sense that  i grant well i grant justice sotomayor that hypo difficult case although i would construe generally applicable talk government it specifically references government i think your honors hypothetical united states alone its undifferentiated reference persons fcra i still think i would call generally applicable tucker act wouldnt come play i dont deny would closer case if court questions i would like reserve balance time no im aware situation i think thats look remedial provision congress enacted determine metes bounds the privacy act remedial mechanism within typically or dont proceed yeah well flsa bit complicated reasons i adverting earlier its  court never confronted question exactly go forward flsa and i think ambiguity courts flsa refers reasons i discussing justice sotomayor earlier i think could see statute incorporating tucker act would something congress ui i think theres several answers ui first im sure way cuts fact  may ul may ui  im sure way cuts one hand fact congress specifically provided united states liable certain situations i think cuts favor understanding but theres fundamental point argument friend makes side that statute enacted i think civil remedies provisions expanded encompass persons so hard conclude that notwithstanding provision would referred something came along later now i two points id like make rebuttal one theres questions today specific statute general statute now one i think clear indication specific statute present purposes fcra look plaintiffs allege the plaintiffs bringing fcra claim theres mistake plaintiffs seek fcra advantage statutory damages least 100 and theyre grounding claim fcra cause action and i think therefore look fcra determine whether government liable and dont situation mix match look fcra determine whether theres clear express waiver sovereign immunity the point i would like discuss something  references something justice breyer adverting earlier even universe could contemplate hybridization apply tucker act even though theres cause action already statute wouldnt context case clear indications congress wouldnt contemplated resort tucker act the tucker act doesnt apply torts this claim tort claim we know court safeco terms ago  551 us 69  specifically referred restatement torts means interpreting term willfulness linchpin claim i see time expired,574.0,813,27,we hear argument case 11192 united states v bormes mr srinivasan under view situation today tucker act would applied statute because start statute always seems youre pointing us looking clear waiver sovereign immunity never another tucker act action future what would look like able get around clear statement rule so basically  im sure even addressing issue tucker act jurisdiction we really briefing issue whether statute issue waives sovereign immunity becomes operative question could i ask mr srinivasan  im sorry i going ask  following question many courts held flsa express waiver sovereign immunity and many recognized tucker act remedy under new approach holding incorrect i presume flsa remedial scheme but federal circuit jurisdiction claims according waiver flsa judicial remedy they authorized go it language  bring suit federal state court competent jurisdiction i dont know  i dont see difference mr srinivasan say good deal recommend basically know read tucker act reverse everything know sovereign immunity really hard get text  tucker act in fact  i mean i guess question do textual argument result asking us reach well thats really textual argument thats argument weve sensibly limited reach tucker act but tucker act seem include friend says includes statute not statute except ones remedial provisions statute i assume appealing textual principle specific governs general isnt whats going that tucker act general provision saying  overcome specific provision provides compensation excludes federal government the united states governed substance credit reporting act the act applies government point theres sanction noncompliance even though united states government system supposed conform standards act excuse 1681bbb said where case you said 7a right still argument  straightforward specific governs general argument i mean would case statute plaintiff trying run around tucker act specifically  clearly prohibits suit government then would say know specific governs general even though govern  tucker act permits statute prohibits but youre saying statute really prohibit youre saying statute permit usual rules waiver sovereign immunity strictly construed so know   difference  odd sort specific governs general argument no thats  thats negative implication statute  affirms liability united states okay but dont  dont negative implication mr srinivasan how specific statute suppose another statute said party bring suits enforce rights persons statute would making argument yes if thats statute says it says party bring suit enforce rights statute so lot hoopla lot detail remedial scheme would still say controls tucker act isnt really  doesnt question come youre putting whether  whether tucker act eliminates statutes presumption liability part united states well really specific governing general way around right the tucker act discusses specifically liability sovereign immunity united states statute generally doesnt address tucker act specific one statute general one youd win argument right you win argument it seems quite right say fcra  fcra specifically address liability united states the tucker act so tucker act one thats specific applies instead general language  fcra in case would lose win yes  known existed so covered tucker act i mean every  every basis suit government every claim government owes money rests upon statutory text doesnt so okay express contracts united states anything else okay but anything comes statute would look statute see whether sovereign immunity statute statute tucker act overcome thats exactly i started thats i started is anything left tucker act so new rule statute written impose obligations government tucker act implicated immediately if rule says government party contracts  medicaid provider  must x y z government medicaid provider burdens accomplishing y unless express waiver sovereign immunity tucker act doesnt come play thats position well going suggest scheme i described says x y z things someone owe obligation sue medicaid provider example breach obligation presumably  im putting lot hypotheticals given case law  youre saying cant sue government tucker act unless express waiver how statute remedial provision lists set legal obligations generally applicable statute doesnt concern united states would argument still apply tucker act force so argument really isnt another statute remedial scheme in briefs present another statute remedial scheme course look particular remedial scheme but would take argument say even statute doesnt remedial scheme dont look tucker act think tucker act limitation tucker acts test  text order make tucker act consistent everything thought knew principles sovereign immunity say i lost give last sentence but moneymandated statute counsel sort begs question statute awards damages breach obligation money mandating the issue whether money mandating question is mandating but issue whether contemplates payment damages it expressly awards i   difficulty argument going back simplified hypothetical government medicaid  x providers x y z persons defined government providers doesnt they pay damages i mean thats pretty clear thank counsel mr jacobs what privacy act so youd say either proceed privacy act youre covered dont and  fsla one what ul friend raised thank counsel the case submitted,1094.0,1308,18,mr chief justice may please court if i may i like begin justice kennedys question is moneymandating statute section 1681a defines “ persons ” defines “ persons ” inter alia government government body agency  that would seem would extraordinarily clear government subject act subject money mandating we we could we believe able recover simply fcra yes your honor but question whether government fact covered would seem to answered 1681bb4 your honor  subject debate court we took appeal federal circuit claim based whole part tucker act yes your honor we dont particularly care your honor believe required statute appeal federal circuit claim based whole part tucker act i  i  i know your honor right and 1681bb4 statute said yes i dont believe your honor i mean 1681p says sue either district court court competent jurisdiction and regard theres lot talk remedial scheme respect your honor i would submit  reticulated remedial scheme file claim hearing kinds things court enforced people here typical statute says a b c dont sued federal court the privacy act your honor allows sue government district court i believe your honor the case printing expiration date your honor yes it like i believe courts jurisprudence long least since jacobs i would submit even earlier dooley onward doesnt make difference whether  youre suing statute united states contract anything else theres element tort it doesnt matter theres doubt intended your honor posed difficult question i would submit statute says may a b c could sue court claims yes even though traditionally could think tort i believe thats courts jurisprudence i think daly  dooley i think your honor 1901 said regardless whether exactions taxes tortious think case within one first class cases specified tucker act claims based upon law congress  your honor i believe court interpreted cases way there debate whether breach fiduciary duty tort something else yet court white mountain cases found bar thats government says also breach fiduciary duty often regarded tort your honor 16 im sorry your honor i would submit yes explicit  knowledge explicit knowledge congressional record whether going impact government however talked almost epidemic proportion identity theft going response bill passed knowing government one largest issuers credit card receipts one would wonder would want exclude government terms protecting public that would make sense it doesnt make difference credit thats exactly correct your honor but thats i said terms protecting public wouldnt want exclude large  large thing and wanted protect government 1681bb4 wanted exclude explicitly next year with respect justice kagan i dont think thats true they went way define person include government and thats significant respect your honor we cite moore case moore v the department agriculture almost identically worded statute said government i dont believe your honor i think went way say applies its general statute says credit card printed improperly well amended fcra 1996 add  change word credit reporting agency person i would submit conscious step and proof found i think two subsequent amendments one next year 1681bb4 saying apply government national security issue and government pointed 1681ui talked fbi improperly disclosed information liability would now appendix governments brief stops but governments petition cert page 78a also 1681ul says provision section notwithstanding people limited remedy government why would congress say liability congress  united states so i believe  congress clear could knew applied united states wanted carve something twice now l yes your honor i believe i believe your honor this u applies united states fbi 1681u explicitly passed regard fbi getting information improperly disclosing and would say notwithstanding provisions wouldnt werent provisions applicable and your honor takes back moore case discussed many times brief similarly almost identical statute equal credit opportunity act the truth lending act equal opportunity  equal credit opportunity act fcra part consumer credit protection act different parts and equal credit opportunity act almost definition one word difference importance and  fifth circuit said exception says person  doesnt exception united states unlike truth lending act specific provision exempting united states this identical except one word different this says emphatic word could use the two statutes say government government entity this statute says government government entity and united states makes response interpretation throughout judicial system and indeed would difficult throughout united states  united states longer even attempts argue ecoa provide waiver sovereign immunity well im hoping wont make much new law your honor i believe consistent courts longstanding jurisprudence and indeed  cases court says going let bring tucker act party trying escape get around limitation substantive act theyre trying avoid statute limitations avoid requirement file  claim elkhorn mining  get around  get away court hinck says tax court jurisdiction and trying get around thats going were  plaintiff case trying evade congressional intent statutory provision fcra and government points nothing  violence would done fcra allowing the  reason statute passed protect consumers the congress clear government violates statute liability i know could clearer moneymandating statute and justice scalia asked well would win  statute my answer would unequivocally yes its unequivocal waiver and thats irony i think  unequivocal waiver statute almost court found yeah thats fair inference moneymandating situation no 2 years 2 years 6 years  2 years discovery 5 years they  different your honor respect i see nothing saying must dont pay  i see nothing unusual saying court claims thats tucker act claim that doesnt seem  thats reticulated statute unlike civil service review act something like steps hearing first hearing yes and thats yes yes and i think consistent courts jurisprudence well your honor i understand question correctly i  i dont believe i agree premise this court consistently said your honor said tucker act provides outer limit filing well use shorter time period in ruckelshaus v monsanto court said no no youve got  monsanto didnt want tucker act claim it wanted able argue we relief available us disclose components insecticides and wanted argue there relief available us and court said no youve got  youve got tucker act claim you relief available and court said yes didnt file claim there procedure could file claim saying this trade secret  would arbitration and court said you havent done go ahead and lets see happens but youve got tucker act claim and incidentally regard ruckelshaus v monsanto court discussed extensively restatement torts whether trade secret  listed trade secret restatement torts went ahead said no youve got tucker act claim absolutely im telling your honor win test we dont believe test called  test used still win clear waiver your honor i would submit that would substantial change courts jurisprudence congress passed tucker act court years said if meet requirements may sue tucker act  no your honor tucker act made available congress could proceed fcra yes could tucker act available statute 1295 says says appealed court appeals but your honor i cannot name case top head as i said i believe privacy act allows either the  im sorry yes the fsla  i going tell your honor said earlier but cases tucker act remedy denied ive said person trying evade limitation substantive act thats case this case foursquare within courts jurisprudence the government argues new  clear exactly test limiting one it would  would cut back tucker act no your honor we believe weve maintained throughout express waiver 1681a the standard i would submit your honor tucker act always available unless  substantive statute provides limitation ability either saying shall  shall litigated tax court litigated preceded claim administrative claim limitation like if  theres something says another forum would evading but otherwise tucker act remedy available appropriate precisely i would submit do do say eh think  know express enough and thats tucker act saying well clearly fair inference thank you,741.0,1141,38,well wouldnt  wouldnt need tucker act would just sue statute so splitting claim i mean cause action fcra tucker act one go federal circuit elsewhere court claims federal circuit what do you also claimed fcra statute right okay so care i mean youre northern district illinois bring case act i guess lost wanted appeal and  big deal appeal seventh circuit who cares why care circuit go you said think  well care i guess government could stipulated agree goes seventh circuit nobody would opposed this case want go  want go federal circuit want go seventh circuit okay im sorry before get but  argument go seventh circuit dont get money right because youre getting money united states dont go court claims case like no do know statutes offhand  i cant think maybe know  get money united states dont go court federal claims federal circuit what statutes and none reason i ask question becomes less less plausible fcra meant allow suit federal government for money damages not tort this seems awful lot like tort tell isnt i mean saying theres statute says cant print last five digits card date expiration date want say “ ” means one doesnt mean andor thats case fundamentally right yeah andor or all right got now print  view printed much persons credit card it sounds like  sort like invasion privacy normally tort what mean you sue  words statute say smith government employee assaults person gets damages federal statute now brings claim  i dont know law im asking im arguing the plaintiff sues united states assault and youre saying bring court claims statute i dont know law works i read i know language doesnt totally tell its liquid illiquid i didnt get part exactly but ive understood cant bring tort suit court claims now thats i would like elaborate sounds rather like tort suit sort thats i asking even says may assault someone and case i look show thats right dont but argument  answer little complicated statute doesnt say tort claims says claims sounding tort means cases arent torts like torts and seems case   like tort invasion privacy something like well friend says thats fiduciary  thats trust breach regarded different tort may i ask mr jacobs whether think congress ever honed issue whether united states given multitude financial transactions engages ever thought sovereign immunity would waived i mean youre right consequences enormous federal fisc and  statute developed peculiar way first definition person civil liability years later prohibition credit card number expiration date in hint congress envisioned waiver sovereign immunity fair credit reporting act for reason principle sovereign immunity theyre  perfectly willing subject corporations immense liability willing subject federal government immense liability thats doctrine sovereign immunity isnt mr jacobs  import governments argument interpretation governed would facing really quite massive change law sovereign immunity weve known time so i give  congress decides pass statute statute cause action and drafters say say government retains sovereign immunity and everybody says rules say nothing government retain sovereign immunity now world next time congress passes statute question comes would say oh say government waives  retains sovereign immunity dont say somebodys going bring action tucker act so every statute ones written old rules new ones come completely flipped presumption now congress going to say wants retain sovereign immunity doesnt  doesnt tucker act applies get court i dont think quite answers question thats  thats question fcra means whether standard whether fairly arguable standard express standard win and thats different question the question standard going hold are going say need show fairly arguable going say unless theres express statement government waived sovereign immunity government retains and youre asking us flip presumption when definition persons put statute civil liability isnt right so didnt  could thinking civil liability i  i really  i havent followed argument you say l shows liability government mind i mean anybody  notwithstanding provision remedies sanctions set forth section shall judicial remedies sanctions violation section why bear upon whether united states liable i see well right i guess could write narrow opinion saying tucker act applies cause action original statute anyway case would made much new law would yes well i mean  lot provisions technical like one i think fairly technical one talking government  provides treble damages  treble damages minimum damage punitive damages fairly lengthy statute limitations compared court claims 2 years and 6 my  impression several differences and normally things least arguably appropriate government government knows law follow hope and therefore dont need browbeating mechanisms make sure follow clarified so therefore  i mean i imagine arguments at time differences relief scheme statute normal one court claims and theyre arguing that means didnt want tucker act things apply i want know reply they different so happy circuits suggestion specific govern general insofar adopt whatever fcras limitations and processes your position thats perfectly okay now seem  i mean justice breyers point it seem little ad hoc in words dont fit quite together answer well well take whatever know whatever to make fit it would go least imposing government it suggests congress expect tucker act apply youve got change remedial provisions fcra get fit tucker act right so  also saying fcra underlying statute clearly waives sovereign immunity dont worry whether standard weak standard tough standard doesnt matter we win anyway so want us say okay we apply tough standard theres still  theres still  sovereign immunity waived fcra and since sovereign immunity clearly waived bring tucker act differences remedial schemes slightly different doesnt matter am i correctly stating telling us one purposes tucker act provide remedy none existed get rid private bills whats wrong governments basic proposition remedy pursue remedy and i think bottom thats argument whats wrong scheme instead permitting two remedies potentially conflicting commands whether amount damages nature recovery statute limitations isnt vision tucker act  role tucker act play one given voice one followed the government doesnt concede cause action fcra they say  say opposite and i find peculiar two causes action thing you proceed either fcra tucker act i mean thats strange it seems one would normally specific governing general so say one fcra need tucker act do case   somebodys allowed proceed tucker act clear ability proceed statute the fsla well the fsla well but mr jacobs trying evade certain kind limitation the limitation trying evade rule waivers sovereign immunity expressed and thats rule trying evade going tucker act but wouldnt need go tucker act the difference going tucker act going statute difference know  standard court going hold to decide whether waiver sovereign immunity you finish sentence thank counsel mr srinivasan three minutes left mr

Douglas,7.0,2.0,1,1891.0,2522,21,thank your honor mr chief justice may please court we bring morning constitutional law question involving commerce clause nebraskas law prohibits transportation water another state unless state reciprocal legislation colorado reciprocal legislation in 1971 nebraska department water resources issued well registration number well question today this registration filing noted face land colorado irrigated the well used appellants predecessors irrigate agricultural land nebraska but later 1971 appellants purchased land predecessors renewed intentions irrigate colorado land they obtained approval proceed manager local water management district this approval included conveyance water pipeline well located nebraska appellants adjacent land colorado the well located feet colorado state line if look page 112 joint appendix map would show location real estate involved proximity well state colorado how deep well the well approximately 300 feet deep your honor how expensive put mr justice white is record it record i answer question he expended approximately 45000 installation underground pipe installation pivot sprinkler irrigation equipment i suppose put six feet side line hed problem i suppose yes would your honor use pivot sprinkler irrigation system pipe approximately 1300 feet center field but would exportation problem into nebraska yes yes your honor colorado absolute prohibition transporting water nebraska do think colorados absolute prohibition less vulnerable commerce clause attack nebraskas no i your honor so dont rely exception reciprocity nebraska makes no i the land upon water but dont rely fact nebraska permit could if appellant permit nebraska yes authorities could give permit nebraska law no could colorado reciprocity statute today i see allow water transported colorado nebraska thats crux case your honor okay yes mr dudden may i ask course commerce clause case isnt yes i notice state argues pages 22 23 brief congress enacted number statutes i think say 37 expressly operate exempt regulation allocation distribution water application interstate clause leaving individual states and i dont see youve addressed argument have i think your honor i havent oral argument however relying mining act desert land act reclamation act 1902 it position none acts direct attention water well may i ask section brief addresses particular argument i dont see reply brief example no brief chief your honor prepare reply brief view number briefs submitted covering issue well course congress right congress done thats end case isnt it would but congress done your honor but going to find that correct except youre going address oral argument yes i the land upon water used nebraska well immediately adjacent contiguous nebraska land note map only small gravel road highway separates tracts based upon approval district appellant invested large sum money approximately 45000 install underground pipelines irrigation equipment commenced irrigating 140acre tract located colorado in 1976 nebraska department water resources issued letter appellants ordering cease transporting water nebraska colorado suit brought nebraska appellants state court enjoin irrigating colorado land nebraska well at point time appellants argued law nebraska law unconstitutional violation commerce clause the nebraska supreme court however affirmed state courts injunction held law constitutional including mandatory reciprocity requirements included nebraska statutes however opinion nebraskas chief justice krivosha vigorously dissented reciprocity issue this appeal followed nebraska held water article interstate commerce therefore court concluded commerce clause apply reciprocity requirement the question court today whether water subject commerce clause standards we know natural resource nebraska statute requiring reciprocity would unconstitutional commerce clause this court great atlantic  pacific tea company case said state cannot discriminate unduly burden interstate commerce mandatory reciprocity clause requirement unconstitutional the question whether water different resources commerce clause purposes nebraska argues water unique exempted commerce clause standards argued three reasons first nebraska defined water state law publicly owned we acknowledge nebraska water publicly owned nebraska public trustee water when character change change public private your honor nebraska constitution declares water publicly owned state state trustee water for persons cities municipalities corporations entity thats point after youve got water glass my understanding feeling your honor nebraska believes water publicly owned points time converted use converted example personal property drawn well water state regardless located publicly owned state well think nobody transfer water right nebraska get paid no position your honor well isnt nebraska law no the publicly owned philosophy justice white i understand would acting public trustee persons desire withdraw water put beneficial use go ahead and acknowledge public trustee ownership and long person person desires withdraw water nebraska may upon applying permission the court hughes versus oklahoma case court held declaration public ownership done nebraska mere fiction makes difference commerce clause purposes in oklahoma case oklahoma claimed public ownership natural minerals much way nebraska attempting claim public ownership water both nebraska oklahoma claimed ownership regulatory nature proprietary commercial since nebraska acting market regulator market participant position nebraska cannot discriminate interstate commerce because nebraska feels way presented three arguments the second argument water different congress federal act authorized western states restrict interstate transportation water while congress may enact legislation position must clear unmistakable language congress acted clear unmistakable language regard subject nebraska relied basic references connection federal laws mining act 1866 desert land act 1877 reclamation act 1902 alleging acts constitute authorizations states prohibit restrict interstate transportation water however none acts contain court said affirmative grant power states burden interstate commerce they none acts contain power in mining act congress opened mineral lands use development citizens confirmed vested water rights in desert land act opened desert lands development citizens confirmed vested water rights well didnt case portland cement case thirties say desert land act severed waters land gave control waters states your honor i believe that case case california versus united states basically concluded operating acts must recognize state water laws but say states power preclude interstate commerce it directed joining hands acts current state laws and reclamation act 1902 congress provided sale public lands proceeds used fund creation irrigation projects therefore agree congress could authorize states prohibit water exports much exempted insurance industry mccarran amendment clear none acts cited nebraska exempt water commerce finally nebraska argues water physically unique however western water law specialist professor corker would disagree theory professor corker written water whatever source economically different resources he points beneficial exchange goods motivating force trade commerce concludes free market motivation equally potent one commodities water well isnt states though certain extent say whether particular natural resource subject ordinary commerce within without state certainly say subject commerce within state cant say subject commerce without state but i understand description nebraska water law one acquires ownership water its simply right use subject public trust that correct so really nebraska taken position contrary one attribute mr corker hasnt well i dont nebraska taken position preclude transportation water across state lines requiring states reciprocal statutes we dont argue nebraska nebraska power control water what arguing power control water extent restrict commerce well client decided wanted sell topsoil wanted take topsoil 140 acres whatever youre talking simply ship someone else another state state nebraska says topsoil simply isnt marketable commodity going allow ship topsoil anywhere bad land i think would depend justice rehnquist nebraska worded law regard preclusion transport across state lines in particular instance requiring neighboring state reciprocity clause law order allow water transported in words i thought didnt rely in words tests reasonable use waste private welfare state nebraska and add addition may transport water another state unless state reciprocates nebraska were contending that one step far instate water users afforded equal treatment outstate water users commerce clause i thought didnt rely reciprocity provision well im sure your honor interpret word rely mean word rely well that important part case know significant part case nebraska law provided reciprocity nebraska law requires reciprocity yes and without relying without statute record nebraska appellant instance would eligible permit use water colorado well think case stronger nebraska absolute prohibition interstate transportation water i think absolute prohibition interstate transportation water nebraska statute identical today so would making arguments yes i would do contend colorados prohibition shipping state water state also unconstitutional yes i your honor then i suppose really doesnt right colorado follow rule law nebraska water rights no basic foundational law different terms ownership do treat like oklahoma they consider public trustees water is law substantially oklahomas earlier case yes or texas whichever similar similar texas law no texas law the texas law old english law absolute ownership and youre talking aldus case your honor yes colorados law modified law modified american law you in complaint didnt expressly attack constitutionality colorado statute no attacked colorado statute if persuaded court that statute invalid i suppose would reciprocity provision colorado statute would longer bar thats correct but but didnt raise it wasnt colorado statute interfering business was it isnt it the nebraska statute interfering appellants rights water now tell under nebraska law water rights transferable private parties yes your honor for money for money and they separated land yes i believe could however instances your honor transfer water money involved price land exactly exactly the farmer buying right irrigate but i suppose water rights adjudicated arent yes and your honor and youre going buy piece land get either title opinion title insurance respect water rights i suppose generally generally simple regulatory procedure a person owning piece land water registration simply makes written request nebraska department water resources instructs transfer next person and theres problem no none your honor what i nebraska client wanted wanted sell water right adjoining landowner today client today if colorado no colorado nebraska in nebraska in nebraska you want separate land water sell water right can nebraska he could your honor water registration specifically provides water used agricultural land they call overlying agricultural land all right but transfer another piece agricultural land yes could and sense could paid yes nebraska in nebraska now sense article commerce absolutely absolutely but cannot could law i take sell water right somebody colorado that correct your honor suppose good water client land could bottle sell omaha lincoln nebraska nebraska supreme court approved commercial sale water drinking purposes metropolitan water district case well gives hint article commerce doesnt i felt your honor yes thats position is limitation areas within nebraska transfer agricultural water is limitation particular aquifer valley the statute provide limitation there lot activity regard intertransportation basins present time your honor well courts administrative agencies taken position they taking positions they starting take positions i thought nebraska law forbade face i read interbasin transfer water except municipality involved that correct correct so flat ban transferring water one watershed another from one watershed another yes but so cant take one basin yes thats correct even nobody permit i take not present times counsel state nebraska also argued look interstate compacts approved congress yes indicator congress believes states free allocate direct transfer water within boundaries yes justice oconnor interstate compacts however purposes states agreeing use water one state move another we impact compact called platte river compact area state nebraska state colorado joined together agreed allow water withdrawn platte river colorado transported canal nebraska this approved congress its position compacts case specific instance represent specific clear language congress remove water interstate commerce they simply agreements contracts states help states transport water back forth among actually contrary position nebraska attempting keep water transported colorado nebraska compacts generally allow water go one state another state agreement it position purpose commerce clause encourage national market resources encourage maximum economic efficiency use resources the mandatory reciprocity clause nebraska law hostile area idea reciprocity necessary remove states embargoes commerce clause creates necessary reciprocity furthermore chief justice said opinion sporhase case reciprocity unnecessary carry nebraskas conservation goals the reciprocity nebraska statute connection need availability water clear remaining part nebraskas law would adequate without reciprocity provisions already provides reasonable uses conservation concern public welfare now clients well critical ground water basin yes but nevertheless given permission dig well withdraw water that correct your honor i would like point well critical township critical area time approved drilled i see and withdrawal well always used calculations district state connection withdrawals water area to allow client continue use well purpose today would make difference use public welfare state nebraska its position dont need discrimination interstate commerce interstate uses water justification what appellant asks court commerce clause exactly commerce clause provides would instate water users state water users afforded equal treatment do think think say someone decided itd good idea buy water could colorado private owners use transport coal slurry pipeline new orleans everybody agreed project carried would dry eastern slope think colorado would i take would say could keep water sold state your honor i dont think thats problem reason i dont well i didnt may problem but that would serious problem people able well state power i dont believe state power so would leave congress yes even emergency state would power i find difficult conceive emergency chief justice burger would warrant use well mr dudden conservation measure state notwithstanding water may subject interstate commerce as conservation matter yes does state authority even yes the states today well instance brother white put would appropriate constitutional conservation measure i think situation course would carefully reviewed independent facts well mean could conserve conservation sense conserve use inside state well i think state i thought saying couldnt possibly keep water home like well i think state current law allows review individual application determine whether uses proposed meet current statutes we dont need prohibition transporting water one state another protect states today protect water citizens water do think congress could statute preempt nebraskas law i think congress statute could specifically say clear language state right no i want run im asking run way congress could remove barriers state law might erect transportation water interstate commerce no i you you dont congress power i think congress power but i believe congress power allow states control water take water interstate commerce if think water article interstate commerce lot places mean congress couldnt insist remove state barriers interstate trade water as long statutes interfere interstate clause united states constitution might able you mean act congress would interfere commerce clause it could but could give power states remove water interstate commerce the commerce clause basically grant power congress thats correct im loss see act congress pursuant commerce clause could interfere commerce clause well go ahead your honors concludes argument thank much thank your honor mr chief justice may please court i think important point mandatory reciprocity requirement eliminated still would remain books records nebraska statutes adequate law allow state nebraska evenhandedly control regulate water they would determining reasonable uses setting forth reasonable uses people could calculate whether making reasonable use water conducting administrative hearings issuing well permits specifically restricting use water particular purpose requested they need mandatory reciprocal requirement order control water nebraska i would like point court case state nebraska specifically defines overlying land discussed quite bit morning i would also like mention opinion congress power regulate concerning water asked court but question thats really court today what law commerce clause congress clearly unmistakeably legislated question it position view acts mentioned counsels opposing brief state nebraska none acts use clear unmistakeable language what youre saying say congress said states free theres commerce clause whatever may congress gives say explicit words that correct and im saying done thank much your honor,24.0,23,1,we hear arguments first morning sporhase moss nebraska mr dudden may proceed whenever ready very well mr anderson thank gentlemen the case submitted,1855.0,2566,44,thank your honor mr chief justice may please court before go far argument i think counsel agree issue discussing today whether commerce clause applies natural water natural resource i think get far that i would like light appellants remarks address specifically areas nebraska law discussed questioning appellant today i would like clear things in answer questions directed justice white appellant saying appellants counsel saying water rights may transferred severed land state nebraska now read sporhase decision nebraska supreme court is printed appendix im reading page 119 appendix court spoke upon feelings said neither courts legislature nebraska considered nebraska ground water article commerce  free transfer exchange ground water market setting never permitted state since water publicly owned  the public legislative action may grant private persons right use publicowned waters private purposes  irrigation drinking thats parens olson opinion demonstrates emphasis sharing times shortage public may limit deny right private parties freely use water determines welfare state citizens stake  even appears water marketed municipal water supply arrangements value cost distributing water basis rate structure value water  appellant recognizes brief page 13 water used irrigation agricultural irrigation must applied overlying land thats overlying land ground water pumped that means nebraska law understood attorney general state apply statutes nebraska water may transferred it may severed land it cannot sold now i impression friend response question said farmer rural areas nebraska especially good water could bottle send omaha sell do agree i thought said supreme court there doubt specific question never arisen your honor doubt water used drinking doubt water used consumption agriculture sort function however water cannot severed land it water right separate title well youve got quart gallon bottles supermarket omaha article commerce bottle article commerce your honor someone selling water nebraska i know would article commerce point your honor water article commerce texas i suppose possessed but water agricultural water irrigation water subject private ownership now position counsel owner farmland could sell water rights used adjacent parcel farmland thats correct your honor nebraska law even basin yes your honor are speaking ground water irrigation water generally irrigation water generally irrigation water storage water youre paying transfer water thats right well im asking im speaking you irrigate farmland north platte valley dont thats correct and source water river thats correct and stored reservoir thats correct and taken thats correct and water rights farmers individual water rights farmers individual water rights natural flow water yes your honor well theyre entitled use land thats correct cast can water sold land can transferred no your honor those waters call rights shares a right appropriation your honor and right appropriation cannot transferred land if use appropriation land three consecutive years appropriation subject cancellation it ceases it cannot used transfer land it cannot used transfer brotherinlaw sell someone else profit money well certainly get money sell land your honor part land it carries value separate land the land value land vary depending upon things the value land vary whether got water rights attached just vary your honor thats correct well not land no but your honor itll vary depending whether aquifer whether whether grow crop want whether adjacent city metropolitan area type soil whether rolling nonrolling none severed land water cannot when say ground water used overlying land well youre certainly talking bigger piece land land surrounds pipe within six feet i suppose youre talking owner use water land owns well thats necessarily your honor well adjacent well thats true i dont know particular case defined well lets take case lets take case theres suggestion particular gentleman wants export water could use water ground water land owns nebraska particular piece he owns how many acres nebraska i cant tell exactly he owns contiguous land your honor i dont believe contest contest but land owns colorado land owns colorado close well land owns nebraska oh closer some land closer thats correct but your honor must recognize water so youre saying certainly land colorado anyway would called overlying i dont agree your honor well i wouldnt think would you cant say overlying state boundary you cant recognized boundary tracts land it legally recognized boundary water your honor you say heres piece land thats within 100 feet well the thing colorado and say isnt overlying although theres part land nebraska 2000 feet well would call overlying well i didnt say 2000 feet well would necessarily overlying your honor i would say water treated allocated states states unit water apportioned this court apportioned water states equitable apportionment decrees judgments the various states congress negotiated approved interstate compacts apportioned allocated water states both approaches conceived water treated subject complete control management regulation states water counsel nebraska repealed reciprocity provision issued permit gentleman transfer water colorado would violate interstate compact that would your honor the question really arises question well relevance interstate compact youre talking the interstate compact two relevances your honor one shows state treated unit manages water number one state boundary meaning water law law water natural resource number two shows congress deference exemption states management water resources water different natural resources mr anderson may i go back law nebraska respect problem confining law within state nebraska adjacent farms theres well one well one second farm get water what kind legal arrangement may make get water land neighboring farm well in nebraska mean yes just nebraska nebraska i want get adjacent parcel problem sort outlined we i understand question two farms one one well one the one without well wants get water neighbor can legally get legally binding agreement entitle get water no your honor cannot he must drill well must appropriate water water source stream access or irrigation canal he cannot get legal protection rights obtain water neighbor happens well your honor doesnt theres provision nebraska law problem your honor thing irrigation districts people dont water underlying land two types water your honor underground water call ground water thats im talking i want get away platte river problem surface water he would source underground water theres sufficient aquifer there land like predominant situation his neighbor hypothesis is way get legally binding commitment neighbor get water needs no the answer no your honor ground water his remedy surface water and thats nebraska water law person overlying land owner well i could add one surface water area pardon if i add mr justice stevens question okay surface water area then your honor theres thing nebraska its dry land its dry land its dry land farming appellant land case does get answer land well located purchased adjacent property neighbor or leased if owned one man owned two tracts land would leeway pumping water i suppose would depend close your honor suppose theyre adjacent well theyre adjacent i dont know sort distances talking if talking two miles weve got one farm one section one farm another probably your honor bridge sections you know youre familiar section lines townships so would give status section lines state boundaries not necessarily your honor state boundaries much important legal importance states units water managed well i thought maybe going say rule would adjoining land outside reaches aquifer couldnt use land aquifers your honor fixed boundaries well i know but usually land got potential value somebody tried drill well theyve found deep dont find water and would like transfer water somewhere else transfer water permitted ground water your honor nebraska and lot dry land farming nebraska i guess thats heres piece dry land leases fellow drilled well found water can fellow well use water adjoining piece land your honor water attached land if land merged way someone wants acquire water acquire land acquire water but water cannot transferred faraway land it cannot used nonagricultural purposes in case it isnt far away its right next door its right across well entirely possible set circumstances your honor would case let ask another irrelevant question probably the sporhases residents colorado thats correct your honor and fair contained colorado amicus brief mentioned nebraska reciprocity statute problem appellants appellants applied colorado authorities permit well colorado tract denied water overappropriated colorado colorado system my question however lived nebraska side youd still taking position their colorado residence immaterial far youre concerned oh yes definitely your honor they yes doesnt matter the statute applies equally your honor appears face appellants never applied permit your honor they never denied never decision upon whether permit granted they pumping water without attempting comply nebraska statute well i thought law supreme court said couldnt get permit anyway reciprocity the law enjoined cant get permit but never applied permit your honor they never took first step let go back go ahead let go back earlier question now i frankly confused your friend said ground water could taken ground put bottles shipped carried truck otherwise omaha sold supermarkets i wasnt sure answer i wish would clear can ground water no no your honor so theres sharp disagreement two particular hypothetical i think light nebraska supreme courts decision case say nabraskam constitutional provision says use water every natural stream within state nebraska dedicated people state beneficial purposes subject provisions section that section applies ground water people could exercise ownership deprive others they use let flow cant theyre depriving others sell water they arent depriving others theyre trying share send omaha bottle but say cant i dont believe decision sporhase case definitive discussion ground water rights ground water could your honor mr attorney general spring water spring water is ground water its spring water i believe your honor would ground water i thinking thats water thats usually bottled naturally reached surface become surface water yes thats usually water thats bottled spring water isnt if spring water i suppose yes spring couldnt transferred not well understanding case your honor sporhase decision ground water would able sold now different i think realize different treatment municipal drinking water agricultural irrigation water the mud case referred appellant case deal transportation water exception general rule the general rule applies agricultural irrigation water however rule municipal drinking water may taken sources water municipalities that goes ground water doesnt thats correct your honor so landowner may transfer water municipality well your honor municipality landowner case said that municipality charging ground water charging cost distributing water value water mr anderson colorado reciprocity statute would satisfy colorado requirement reciprocity i take nebraska statutes would permit issuance permit take water state not necessarily your honor now heres supreme court says the statute allows transfers namely transfers across state lines conditioned receipt permit director  department water resources may grant permit transfer reasonable contrary conservation use ground water  thats supreme court says now im reading a7 jurisdictional statement page 119 thank one conditions met contrary use ground water use ground water state use well i agree might forbid but would could also permit oh yes your honor event seems provision situation water may transferred outside state i think case situation would apply municipal water purposes your honor this reading legislative history enactment enacted municipal water purposes city superior nebraska could acquire municipal water supply kansas the distinction mr anderson may i ask question please even absent reciprocity provision could nebraska prevent taking water area determined critical water area used couldnt nebraska achieve result absent reciprocity provision like well could it could your honor applied standard instate state uses and case wouldnt commerce clause applies would uniform instate state uses and real question and might reach end result area water supply low critical right well might your honor the problem then explain statement brief talk might happen invalidate reciprocity provision say alternative application silent de facto reciprocity consideration what mean well i meant your honor state looking trying balance exports imports order ensure water land state one considerations well saying even invalidate youd consider would thing youre no your honor i didnt understand statement no case but state attempting maintain static water table particular area areas state particularly control area critical township well located great deal control the problem reason important look whether commerce clause applies case reach question whether reciprocity statute reciprocity clause considered evaluated concluding commerce clause applies water and dont think commerce clause apply water three reasons one three reasons either congress deferred states specific enactment statutes any particular one youve got 37 cited you mean all statutes contain language defers states your honor well congress said many words statutes commerce clause shall apply ground water it and states free regulate has said many words well certainly many words yes your honor it says which statute section 8 1902 reclamation act your honor nothing act shall  where reading i dont well i guess page 23 brief isnt thats where cite section 8 yes your honor 23 brief says nothing act shall construed affecting intending affect way interfere laws state territory relating control appropriation use distribution water used irrigation vested right acquired thereunder  united states shall comply laws and repeated flood control act 1944 in pretty much words pretty much go i think your honor 37 acts repeated ratification approval interstate compacts negotiated states congress specifically recognized states power manage water this court recognized decrees if youre right whats left commerce clause argument theres nothing left respect natural resource water water unique natural resource well i know purposes case that determinative case your honor well course argument side point left states but theres nothing specific acts speak interstate commerce authorizing restrictions movement water another state there specifically your honor interstate compacts statutes restriction upon water the state manages water management decisions restrict water in instance case colorado permit decisions water exported state region the appellants applied permit use water overlying land denied anyone applying state colorado export water could export their management water colorado prevents exportation gets us commerce clause review and congress said state statutes controlling area therefore commerce clause review necessary is correct argument based reclamation act statutes valid city aldus case overruled i dont think your honor aldus case deals completely different state management in words think statutes say water article commerce state law nebraskas thats statutes add i think i think recognize your honor i think aldus hudson case approach case consistent water unique natural resource state dedicated people treated commodity at point time agricultural irrigation water water nebraska treated commodity article commerce it sold and legal framework true eleven states filed generally eleven states filed briefs support water reachable commerce clause reason congressional deference and also i think look legal theory usery case water state nebraska elsewhere within arid western states become area traditional functioning states its part state sovereignty it important people state fire protection police protection health sanitation parks recreation areas mentioned usery case discussed case last week long island railroad case the usery case apply nebraska day day decisions made relating economics life drinking water social interests people nebraska arizona colorado utah western states relate directly peoples everyday lives now let take back quote california united states referred colloquy i read language court limited water used irrigation now view water talking used irrigation this isnt would affect bottling water ground water selling supermarkets omaha suggested were this irrigation i didnt suggest your honor we dealing irrigation case bar supreme court ruling nebraska supreme courts ruling case i think far irrigation water goes agriculture subject ownership sale marketsetting subject commerce clause we would urge your honor affirm nebraska supreme court finding water unique

advice detective speak officer present constituted functional equivalent custodial interrogation we maintain reaching conclusion arizona supreme court misapplied courts reasoning analysis concerns miranda rhode island versus innis decisions when hearken back innis explained detail miranda meant encompasses courts definition custodial interrogation functional equivalent we find courts concerns voiced innis combination interrogation custody might work compulsion upon accused might subject examiner undermine privilege compulsory selfexamination however court also said innis important thing ignored arizona supreme court analysis interrogation conceived miranda clarified innis involve degree compulsion must police compulsion necessarily inherent custody now thing your honors happened case linda mauro insisted upon seeing husband the police acquiesced request officer present valid reasons trial court found officer overheard incriminating statements tape recorded tape recorder full view mr mauro aware trial court also specifically made finding we submit simply functional equivalent custodial interrogation courts cases miranda rhode island versus innis that requires added degree compulsion inherent custody that simply present this court also said innis interrogation means words actions part police police know reasonably likely provoke incriminating response but one read conjunction requirement part definition interrogation reflect compulsion beyond inherent custody that simply test made court reversing rhode island supreme court innis noted two patrolmen talking patrol car presence defendant expressed concern child school handicapped finding shotgun innis concealed court said rhode island supreme court correctly found degree subtle compulsion enough and police talking right defendants presence defendant course back patrol car captive audience so submit standard innis simply met case very simply interrogation within meaning innis clarified miranda this court said innis also statements obtained one arrested necessarily barred use totally volunteered statements violate fifth amendment privilege we cited court seventh circuits decision united states ex rel church versus derobertis there kelly church older brother michael church asked police please place cell brother michael told police going try persuade michael confess get younger brother casey trouble police knowing kelly going try persuade michael confess place michaels cell the seventh circuit said equivalent custodial interrogation police rhode island versus innis no your honor i simply saying standard enunciated apply facts case no your honor whether interrogation question law i submitting question law arizona supreme court wrong but i saying seventh circuit rejected similar attack michael church case cited brief the approach used butfor test i submit respect exactly arizona supreme court applied michael church says but police putting older brother cell knowing put going try persuade confess i would confessed  well kelly church successful his brother later asked pencil paper wrote confession here arizona supreme court said i think i oversimplify police simply cannot let defendants wife talk even request advice stand listen that holding arizona supreme court church rejected similar claim ask court i think would critical perhaps sixth amendment context your honor respondent conceded page 9 answering brief arizona supreme courts opinion makes abundantly clear decided purely fifth amendment grounds let put way i dont think circumstances case would make difference your honor i dont think would sixth amendment fifth amendment violation interrogation there compulsion police neither secrecy surreptitious interrogation well right counsel invoked your honor i would taking precisely position police she wanted talk husband they allowed they policeman stationed valid reasons trial court found suppression hearing even though arizona supreme court mention valid reasons the line cases court decided sixth amendment massiah henry olton versus maine cases like concerned surreptitious questioning informant agent police no one disputes conceded plainly conceded linda mauro agent informant police yet request idea see husband certainly nothing done surreptitiously the testimony detective manson trial suppression hearing small room captain lathams office it chairs bookshelves captain lathams desk one seated desk they seated chairs middle room detective manson told linda mauro might see husband going present going record sat within three four feet mr mauro tape recorder top knee he legs crossed tape recorder top knee the trial court specifically found mauro knew police listening man three feet also recorded if mean justice oconnor simply planted circumstances remained i dont believe would your honor still official police conduct there compulsion required innis as matter fact court recently decided case precisely point similar respects name case i sorry kuhlman kuhlman versus wilson mr wilson placed cell informant bennie lee now police told lee listen dont try stimulate conversation charged listen and court upheld admission statements wilson made lee basis course surreptitious i mean wilson didnt know lee government informant certainly didnt know recorded dont even circumstances like the arizona supreme court he invoke right counsel yes your honor fifteen minutes previously asked counsel police ceased questioning thats correct your honor fifteen minutes police ceased questioning they asked nothing invoked counsel 1045 this brief exchange wife occurred approximately 1100 oclock 15 minutes later i think your honor would closer case idea yes originating police trying get brother something but arent circumstances case the arizona supreme court held submit erroneously state could even use brief tape rebuttal relied upon courts holding wainwright versus greenfield we submit grievous error tape used rebuttal the trial courts findings i urge scrutinize pages 216 220 joint appendices made complete specific findings matters the trial court held well first let set stage let tell defense counsel done building insanity defense first tape needed certainly used prove mr mauro committed murder he admitted numerous people circlek shortly done it wasnt needed prove act all needed show mental state rebut insanity defense what defense counsel done put stand bruce griffin defense attorney say mr mauro day murder november 23rd 1982 saw later day mauro talked wife later day everything defense counsel presented day murder far conversations later day tape mauro wife mr griffin described mr mauro i summarize fairly salivating slobbering catatonic madman that gist description then relying upon psychiatrist defense psychiatrist dean gerstenburger mr gerstenburger also observed mauro later day even later mr griffin observed gerstenburger got good many hearsay statements mr mauro response but important gerstenburger relied upon tape recording exhibit 172 admitted defense counsels request tape recording another defense attorney donald bayliss mr mauro now your honors important realize i know either heard tape hear mr bayliss asking mr mauro questions day murder later conversation mauro wife hear bayliss asking questions hear response mauro thats defense counsel wanted jury unintelligible animallike sounds similar grunting moans anything else thus portraying jury incoherent irrational person sounding like animal anything else oh initially exclusively decided case basis fifth amendment they initially exclusively decided case basis fifth amendment courts holding in greenfield mean your honor i think your honor cited arizona cases arizona rules evidence arizona law allowing rebuttal they relied exclusively courts decision greenfield had arizona law arizona rule evidence wished rely upon would they relied upon courts decision well your honor i agree decided reversed basis interrogation i agree but i saying court disagrees position fundamentally unfair allow prosecutor use brief exchange mauro wife show several things that reason present argument also the trial court found probative probative relevant thing prosecutor could present rebuttal following reasons please let apprise number one showed plainly anything else prosecution could present mauros state mind closest time committed murder the tape mauro wife closest thing time committed murder defense counsel lengthy cross examination linda mauro stand least three days also examination eight pages devoted closing argument attempted portray jury least partially wholly responsible childs brutal murder suffocation having done trial court concluded legitimate fundamentally unfair allow prosecutor let jury hear tape could hear mauros voice judge thinking intimations pauses hear wifes voice accusations implications defense counsel making it effective thing the key question the relevance hearing wife your honor defense counsel attempted portray wife responsible murder this tape well read no no your honor no wasnt purpose state offered the state offered rebut claim insanity well trial court held important your honor cant piece paper cant get intonations pauses that simply one trial courts findings oh yes i agree simply one reason trial court gave correct justice stevens the primary reason state introduced rebut insanity defense i merely saying trial court found additional reasons allow also course nature mauro said brief exchange shows better anyone could man rational least time spoke wife something else no your honor they said well let something thing effective well let put carefully framed questions witnesses describe general demeanor whether generally able speak rationally well course thats fine defense counsel i dont well perhaps read opinion differently point your honor certainly said cant make specific reference conversation you cant quote now perhaps could said well said seem rational but effect jury defense tape hear moaning groaning like animal response mr baylisss questions certainly could done your honor would effective what i point significant distinction case greenfield also greenfield invoked miranda rights court found fundamentally unfair implicit assurance miranda later let prosecutor impeach prosecutor case chief incidentally so person relying miranda rights there ambiguity silence court said could unfairly penalize innocent person court pointed innocent well guilty may invoke right silence right consult counsel fifteen minutes earlier your honor testimony that correct your honor exchange wife in exchange wife told shut get attorney he didnt rely miranda rights okay your honor theres two conversations involved there one 1045 15 minutes tape that correct your honor nobody ever gave testimony about invoking right remain silent that wasnt given the tape 15 minutes earlier wife saw doesnt rely rights he doesnt invoke rights he says you shut  you get public attorney get one  thats greenfield he telling somebody else yes your honor going back first point i argued interrogation thats true but i dont see what i saying invoke miranda rights he told use miranda rights thats im saying well thats distinction greenfield greenfield invoked rights we also cited court case nichols versus wainwright eleventh circuit find impermissible prosecutor use impeachment statement defendant made onehalf hour arrest now time arrest nichols invoked miranda rights right remain silent right counsel he invoked halfhour later made statement saying duress well nichols didnt even take stand mauro take stand but defense attorney able get testimony though another witness police officer said yes told duress  now eleventh circuit said nothing greenfield doyle versus ohio prohibits use man rely miranda rights argued defense attorney argued got evidence something postmiranda warning made statement duress proved innocence said going use postmiranda statements like specifically rely proximity time arrest defense dont believe greenfield doyle prohibits prosecution impeaching even defendants prior silence this court said even court disagree fifth amendment violation court said cases harris versus new york oregon versus haas even fifth amendment violation occurred submit one that mean state forever prohibited using evidence fashion thereafter the court well recall cases involved absence miranda warnings proper miranda warnings defendants took stand impeached prior inconsistent statements voluntary let point never question mauros brief comments wife voluntary the trial court specifically found i point dr gerstenburger defense psychiatrist said comments voluntary showed moment mauro made much touch reality times later day why important dr gerstenburger testified mauro fluctuated and reality three weeks prior day committed murder so trial court noted extremely probative relevant jury hear short tape wife see much touch reality reality time closest murder but case harris versus new york cases court said long statements voluntary trial court made separate finding voluntary knowing intelligent made separate finding three prongs may used impeachment that precisely done submit nothing submit number one yes impeachment defendant took stand your honor thats correct no one we impeaching defense evidence simply babbling animal later day yes your honor the nichols case decided eleventh circuit defendant take stand either but statement came nonetheless and eleventh circuit considering courts holdings greenfield doyle you quite right your honor circumstances rationale different but i saying i dont see anything fundamentally unfair course i analogizing circumstances i analogizing harris versus new york oregon versus haas saying keeping mind concerns court voiced i believe i incorrect i believe justice blackmun said oregon versus haas we engaged search truth criminal trial long search properly surrounded proper constitutional  yes your honor could use opinions defense still benefit showing defendant unintelligible person making animallike sounds tape live tape play jury thats impression jury rest day theres nothing counter no i saying your honor i saying certainly wouldnt best rebuttal that true would your honor but would effective rebuttal our position your honor number one simply interrogation courts definition miranda innis even there nothing fundamentally unfair allowing used simply rebuttal unless court questions i would like reserve time thank mr chief justice it little bit late your honor respondent arguing edwards issue arizona supreme court plainly decided basis fifth amendment miranda rhode island versus innis why say that basis arizona supreme courts decision your honor because that basis arizona supreme courts decision edwards no edwards clearly relevant thats imposed obstacle police interrogation would ask know invoked edwards all right your honor in response edwards requires police initiate contact well would agree hypothetical walked together unannounced police officer said man would please tell wife answer questions i asking  yes i think i would agree hypothetical your honor but thats happened thats right but said would please talk wife tell everything remember  probably result that also happened as soon take away question mark different case well police initiation anything your honor you allowing wife see thats what police officer brought station hadnt asked said we would like go talk husband would like listen  thats said walked exactly a much closer much tougher whats answer if say nothing presence said hard case theory well least police initiating encouraging wife the difference two cases case asked initially turned talked boss boss said no take  it would different boss first instance said go get take  that would different case that would different case okay but point i going make mrs walsh perfectly correct trial judge say findings pages 218 219 joint appendix told linda mauro husband recorded actually detective manson keep record straight told linda mauro but answer obvious mrs mauro walked room mr mauro say get  i dont want talk  as matter fact look last response brief exchange thats finally told dont talk  thats showed rational he didnt refuse see wife let point its like edwards jailer came said theres police want talk edwards says no i dont want  the jailer tells youve got edwards talks thats case he didnt talk wife he could kept mouth shut the trial court made common sense observation also he chose he never said i dont want see wife get  he talked and police stand listen it simply meet courts requirements innis miranda respectfully ask court reverse,292.0,462,34,we hear argument number 852121 arizona versus william carl mauro mr roberts may proceed whenever ready mr roberts asking cut back rhode island innis you dont think fact bound application innis no charge filed yet what right counsel invoked well mr roberts think result would different police simply planted tape recorder defendants wife let speak defendant wasnt obvious defendant no policeman present listening hear tape recorder planted do think result would different mr roberts i refresh recollection justice white asked would make difference invocation right counsel i thought yes i see so case already asked counsel did ask counsel well wanting silent i suppose would different police secured someone asked brother go talk get could of approaching mr roberts let ask something do think arizona court initially decided case basis fifth amendment say well isnt talk sixth amendment greenholtz pure dicta doesnt defeat i cant get away fact pure factual application innis case talk greenfield sixth amendment rather way i must confess i little puzzled what relevance wifes voice i still dont understand this offered evidence show wife responsible murder to rebut claim insanity its voice said mean it wasnt voice for tape important mere tone everything important said important jury right clear hadnt anything murder what arizona supreme courts response argument didnt say could done thing without listening tape generally particular case i mean particular interview could described manner talked you cant quote and couldnt testified moaning groaning like animal he invoking miranda rights said wanted lawyer testified wasnt well extent invoked miranda rights miranda rights you mean didnt ask warnings spoke i dont understand right he involved well question i understand whether previous invocation miranda rights asking lawyer tainted conversation wasnt given lawyer question whether interrogation isnt whole case i understand point of course one take view arizona supreme court adequately invoked miranda rights wins if disagree interrogation loses i dont understand invoking miranda rights conversation wife im kind puzzled there lot distinctions greenfield i dont understand theyve got issue was impeachment cases was impeachment live trial testimony showing perjuring that isnt case thats little different thing saying going allow used order protect integrity trial system somebody tries perjure trial well let but youre really saying refute anything come the whole trial refutation things isnt where draw line i see line allowing prevent perjury others i dont see line youre drawing so long youre refuting something is correct though case tape arizona supreme court said would right use tape play psychiatrist could testify interpreting rational they wouldnt treat countervailing evidence psychiatrist said well i listened particular time perfectly rational  you mean wouldnt believe psychiatrist it certainly would show always talk way recorded one particular point time thank mr roberts well hear mrs walsh thank mr roberts the case submitted,1342.0,1547,10,thank mr chief justice may please court i would agree justice blackmun saying perhaps merely case factual application rhode island versus innis situation arizona supreme court chose find activity police department flagstaff arizona nothing functional equivalent custodial interrogation this court rhose island versus innis defined functional equivalent custodial interrogation specifically activity police engage in know incriminating statements likely made here absolutely clear case the police knew incriminating statements likely made in fact two police officers indicated specifically knew linda mauro may involved crime somewhat dark afraid bill linda mauro might concoct stories might try get stories yes it involve knowing it also involves type activity sort active role allowing conversation commence mr chief justice i would disagree specifically police department controlled whether conversation took place you look scenario the police said linda mauro may speak husband taped present now take step back bill mauros shoes one supervisor said pardon yes justice the trial court say however evidence testimony three police officers testified know arizona supreme court find know yes i believe he know wife coming they came room no debated in fact presence tape recorder necessarily relevant the result would occur police officer testifying conversation whether tape recording actually admitted i dont believe tape recording operative factor i think fact police officer room listening conversation told conversation would take place i would agree well i believe trial court found mr mauro knew wife coming knew police officer going record conversation yes i would submit that highly coercive situation she hysterical tape bears she crying she sobbing he seen wife since left house i would agree coercive situation yes but i believe police going room wife hysterical police officer testified upset fact thats didnt want going allowing go listening conversation knew likely would incriminating statements made its like excited utterance exception evidentiary laws but i think police produce coercion allowing two get together i think highly coercive situation look facts case a child dead they seen since left house suitcase she emotional wreck point time course coercive of course like excited utterance expect somebody going say something theyre going thinking preserving miranda rights situation this court rhode island versus innis also touched upon fact incriminating statements specifically include statements introduced whether inculpatory exculpatory long produced prosecution i think necessarily relevant statements admitted rebuttal opposed admitted case chief inculpatory admitted behalf prosecution show evidence sanity no the brief exchange no i dont believe miranda requires questions i think rhode island versus innis touched defining functional equivalent you dont need necessarily ask questions i think miranda require specifically questions asked i think coercive police activity find no i think court mentioned contact defendant police jailers times that could produce kind conversation first blurt yes i  you tried best stop  no it introduced order rebut insanity defense but first prosecution prove sanity beyond reasonable doubt so demonstration sanity police station constitutes incrimination police cannot anything him station might let show sane thats rather extreme position isnt that would extreme position i think happens police officers brought husband wife together specifically create situation incriminating statements might made i would agree tried introduce show said committed yes but introducing show sane thats i think problem give fact miranda violative statements cant say miranda miranda violative situation raise insanity defense waive miranda rights rights protected constitution what would saying course couldnt introduce statements otherwise invoke insanity defense indeed waiving right exclude miranda violative statements i would submit that would unfair result unfair burden legitimate criminal defendants raise insanity defense legitimately case well careful talking prisoner custody think going raising insanity defense you cant talk anything i dont think because say recording the recorder didnt matter you shouldnt able testify man seemed rational you really keep incommunicado i think arizona supreme court addressed issue i think testify behavior cannot provoke situation putting husband wife together granted linda mauros idea i dont think know still testify behavior it doesnt make sense talk provoking demonstration rationality one provoke confession yes i committed crime but talking provoking demonstration rationality seems strange concept i dont think provoking rationality per se attempting get anything could use guy wife prosecution introduced incriminating statements far committing crime they introduced order show sanity the thing little bit problem reason they say point attempt state attempts raise argument attorney testified behavior tape admitted another attorney defense attorney took client mr mauro somehow waiver allowed supposing i lets take classic fifth amendment context supposing i called committee congress begin interrogate say whats name i say i decline testify ground might incriminate  and person asking question says well always held answer name address  you get something actually incriminating  and i say no i give name might prove i rational therefore  wouldnt think would permissible basis invoking fifth amendment committee would no why make difference miranda designed secure fifth amendment rights i think arizona supreme court trying say approve behavior police department going allowed introduce tape evidence well thats perfectly permissible want say matter arizona law but they said federal constitution prevents i mean enough supreme court arizona doesnt approve behavior police department sustain federal constitutional challenge i think arizona supreme court saying violation federal constitution fifth amendment violation hold cannot turn around introduce back door insanity defense raised and saying going situation invoke raise insanity defense going give miranda rights evidence would allowed show man committed crime assuming fifth amendment violation what say going backdoor incriminating statements commit crime and taken police department arizona supreme court held impermissible conduct i take wife came visit husband police said fine go ahead policeman present recording device lady talked husband came back said i want tell husband said  told quite incriminating says sure ill testify  would violation miranda rights police permitted wife talk no i dont think could say that would violation miranda rights i think situation assuming husbandwife even though police let lady gave permission thought well may make incriminating statements may tell us i think getting little remote time something like rather police going so police presence i believe police presence arizona supreme court condemning well anything cases indicates that case turn kind factor i dont believe justice oconnor i think case turn fact found functional equivalent custodial interrogation also turn fact assuming fifth amendment violation cannot introduce tape evidence well i interested whether fifth amendment violation i dont see im trying understand makes fifth amendment violation the fifth amendment violation comes fact i think supreme court arizona pointed linda mauro asked go see husband police could gone taped statements made situation they could interrogate but they put agent police certainly motivating factor prompted make incriminating statements well granted defendants wifes request talk yes and sat plain view yes and say coercion i say circumstances case coercive behavior take tack appropriate waiver edwards under edwards need kind initiation contact defendant need in words think edwards means police could permit wife see i think counsel right counsel invoked case police could gone wife unbeknownst husband there initiation this beknownst husband not walked he sayso whether could see wife he sitting they walk wife police officer tape recorder she hysterical sobbing crying and shes blurting things hes blurting things and i think edwards analysis would appropriate done case completely analyze whole situation edwards initiation voluntariness first know free choice second understand consequences going wife walks police officer would get mental state well did ask see wife no well i thought attorney general said i believe testimony brief statement trial court judge knew i believe testimony consultation detective manson linda mauro include statements bill mauro either detective manson sergeant allen captain latham anybody would knew wife coming and trial judge make offhanded comment knew i think testimony go testimony police officers indication knew wife coming ms walsh let see i understand theory you saying invoked right counsel edwards police cannot initiate interrogation police officer walked unannounced wife said man will please tell wife everything ive asking  would clearly impermissible or said i hope youll talk wife i sit listen  would closer saying functional equivalent walks sits listens boil thing that position i take my position yes would functional equivalent would appropriate waiver its much interrogation implicitly says id like talk lady  says please thats right the police officers testified basically went find going i think also important remember possible get husband wife together take care problem escape allowing take care problem safety allowing thats motives speak jail facilities there testimony could everybody knew getting ready take bill mauro jail facilities could allowed bill linda talk together thats desired the fact matter wanted find going they wanted find lindas involvement they wanted find two going concoct stories and motive going listening even taking tape recorder accumulate incriminating evidence see could get i would submit that shows activity police department condemned arizona supreme court amounted functional equivalent custodial interrogation rhode island versus innis intent police officers testimony clear arizona supreme court saying activity going condemned we going allow tape recording made i think arizona supreme court also said invoke insanity defense going make exception we going hold miranda rights even though may violated going fruits evidence drawn going allowed back door invoked insanity defense i think reasons arizona supreme court correct finding functional equivalent custodial interrogation tape correctly held suppressed court,218.0,317,18,doesnt fifth amendment mean something police know incriminating statements might made doesnt push incrimination come police is active role allow conversation come the fifth amendment talks compulsory selfincrimination miranda talks coercion station house environment and simply let man talk wife doesnt seem fit heads they tried talk didnt is necessary one i mean didnt instigate tried talk they try talk well original police officer tried talk emotionally upset however went supervisor supervisor said sure i dont see problem  you go listen take tape recorder  i think whole issue control struck arizona supreme court defining functional equivalent custodial interrogation you bill mauro sitting knowing whats going necessarily he doesnt know wife going come he doesnt know police officer going tape recording conversation may i interrupt counsel point didnt trial court find defendant know told conversation would taped there conflict arizona supreme court found trial court found the tape recorder plain view thats debated you would agree i suppose tape recorder would perhaps influential jury verbal testimony police officer mrs kelly point upon said trial court superior court supreme court arizona disagreed whether knew advance surely knew fact came police officer fact came sat that situation its enough coercive matter fact it coercion produced police cases wouldnt agree but suggesting police know incriminating statement likely interrogation part i think forgetting necessity police produced coercion were statements result questions does miranda require questions you assert i guess assert mere demonstration rational constitutes incriminating statement i mean wasnt substance anything said showed guilty crime fact rational now million things police could would produce result walking breakfast saying heres breakfast  how feeling morning  and says well im fine  how  now police allowed either causing incriminate so whats wrong happened i mean introduced blurted yes i introducing trial the thing introducing fact man rational right wasnt purpose allowed introduced thank mrs walsh mr roberts

pursuant title vii civil rights act 1964 42 usc section 1981 the defendants case employer lukens steel company united steelworkers america two locals in courts plaintiffs prevailed claims employer one three claims union the unions plaintiffs petitioned court both petitions granted and theyve consolidated argument the question presented unions petition whether either title vii section 1981 imposes unions affirmative duty combat employer discrimination the question presented plaintiffs petition statute limitations apply 1981 claims section 1981 claims case i plan devote opening argument issue raised unions petition affirmative duty issue my presentation two parts i discuss legal position quite straightforward basically position duty title vii imposes unions respect employer discrimination duty cause attempt cause discrimination thats duty stated section 703c3 title vii that provision leaves room affirmative duty part unions combat employer discrimination likewise section 1981 court already held general building contractors duty section 1981 imposes duty engage intention discrimination section 1981 impose duty party combat discrimination another party to interpret either statutes place affirmative duty unions combat employer discrimination would inconsistent role unions set forth system labor relations set national labor relations act before i elaborate points i want address another matter plaintiffs pleaded tried case theory affirmative duty combat employer discrimination argued case court appeals theory say case doesnt raise issue plaintiffs wrong i think worth taking minutes demonstrate theyre wrong process legal issues focussed plaintiffs complaint asserted three claims unions two claims claims unions discriminated one claim unions adopted maintained discriminatory seniority system unions discriminated processing grievances the district court found union claims the third claim plaintiffs complaint based affirmative duty theory in words complaint unions quote failed act affirmatively cause employer refrain discriminating black employees race color it theory district court found unions liable and finding district court find unions failed generally oppose employer discrimination the findings district court record clear unions made many efforts many successful the court based finding liability case narrower failure unions part repeated failure assert racial discrimination ground grievances it failure breach affirmative duty found district court in regard significant court find unions failure motivated racial racially motivated it find unions giving inferior treatment black employees opposed white employees and find unions failure raise race discrimination ground grievances racial classification your honor the third circuit your honor sentence said unions conduct violated duty fair representation this case was one bases complaint case brought title vii section 1981 clear district court found i think your honor dont deal theory but i think useful raised case i think useful understand its part general context case union breach duty fair representation the duty fair representation tell unions priority tactics it doesnt dictate substantive position what duty fair representation says whatever respect members exclusive authority act behalf without improper motivation you cannot discriminatory you cannot arbitrary and cannot act bad faith so unions taking actions arent discriminatory arbitrary bad faith fact based ground duty fair representation come play and your honor i think but i think youve got i think good time i think youve got focus various practices because effect made findings respect practices found unions liable and i think helpful looking findings shows case fact affirmative duty case shows affirmative duty reduces practice judicial second guessing unions tactics union priorities i think basic finding union court district court made union another ground available grievance would base grievance ground ground race discrimination but court recognized unions reluctance reluctance unions number instances make claims race discrimination grievances court recognized unions reluctance tactical reasons racial reasons for example black employee laid junior white kept job black employee would solid seniority grievance the layoff order entitled keep job seniority basis to add race discrimination claim instance would help grievant if hes senior hell win hes senior hell lose but addition court found union unions perception there may disadvantages grievant raise race discrimination claim like its difficult prove race discrimination case illustrates alleging race discrimination youve already got solid objective ground like seniority may well tend complicate delay resolution grievance and addition court found union perception raising race discrimination made difficult settle individual claims company these considerations testified black white grievance men including number plaintiffs witnesses excuse court accepted reasons reasons unions reluctance indeed court found pursuing approach unions successful combatting employer discrimination number areas i wont quote page 93a the petition appendix 852010 court goes great detail pressing grievances objective contract ground fact successfully combatted employer discrimination number areas plaintiffs brought claims well adding second factor i would agree your honor well union decides process race discrimination claims racial reasons racial animus clearly grievance your honor i think i dont think could inferred fact alone certainly case reasons apparent didnt inference would event overcome the district court found union discriminated processing grievances blacks whites treated alike and finding anywhere blacks got inferior treatment no your honor there finding number court said repeated instances black grievant came union complaint seniority complaint overtime complaint shift differential complaint said union i think reason i didnt get i gotten race discrimination finding district court unions case ground reluctant allege race discrimination your honor there couple instances another ground i think deal separately one probationary yes your honor i dont think court found one way documents records grievances racial grievances and record your honor i believe court appeals affirm basis district court used the court appeals some references but i think analysis the court appeals said gravamen wrong union failed assert race discrimination basis grievances and court appeals district court said failure intentional failure unions knew employer discrimination failed failed raise discrimination grievances the court appeals took finding put labels district court put i think issue remains the court example justice oconnor stated called violation duty fair representation the court said violation section 703c1 but i think labels i dont think court seeing case differently characterizing case differently district court i think certainly would your honor in fact one one claims case borders on rationale the court found unions object companys tests kinds but court faulted union unions grievances companys tests based race discrimination based independent ground contract job relatedness ground under unions contract unlike title vii test job related invalid the union gone ground the director arbitration union international union testified union done it already grievances already incredibly complicated processed international union arbitration department local union local union people proving job relatedness required kinds expert testimony technical knowledge expertise to add second ground would necessary union prevailed job relatedness ground add second ground race discrimination would add whole layer complication your honor testimony but couple factors one absolutely clear job related test would struck it clear the test disparate impact job related would occur the union would argue event test would struck clear that would case but second one unions objectives strike test everybody if union job relatedness test test struck everyone it clear would happen union successful striking test racial discrimination grounds your honor finding case your honor would threshold question i guess thered two threshold questions the first 703c2 would disparate impact section believe addressed situations union controls access jobs hiring hall union actually controls job opportunities that disparate impact section apply kinds union representation goes kind industrial union setting there i dont think issue resolved one way the second point no claim that claim no theres title vii claim claim unions had violated title vii policy disparate impact there finding claim i want add i think important disparate impact really results from employer discrimination policy union applying and impact thats negative blacks fact employers discriminating doesnt successfully combat i think theres room disparate impact theory even i wrong first point and i dont think disparate impact meant basis holding one party liable another partys intentional discrimination the party sue discrimination would party committing and confirmed case unions section 703c3 section 703c3 states exclusive ground holding union liable employer discrimination it says first two subsections 703c talk discriminatory conduct union within section 703c3 addressed union responsibility employer conduct and says union held liable employer discrimination union causes attempts cause discrimination and i think interpretation would say union somehow another policy doesnt good enough job combatting employer discrimination disparate impact violation i think would inconsistent section your honor i saying i want rephrase little bit okay the answer would violation that would violation but i want make clear talking it would disfavor blacks sense unions would taking actions would would favorable unique interests it different giving kind inferior treatment blacks treating discriminatory manner i want get probationary employees the probationary employees different situation entirely there court found court found employer discriminating blacks discharge probationary employee employees it found union challenge discharges but also found union didnt challenge discharges and reason court found discriminatory one the court found union tremendous backload grievances unresolved didnt process kind claim probationary employees reason includes whole gamut contract claims raised probationary employee would affect whites well blacks the rights limited contract probationary employees rights upon discharge limited since 1974 discrimination based your honor it clear that order order know disparate impact blacks unions policy would proved lot things proved trial court you would prove assuming moment disparate impact theory would apply would know grievances would processed claims claims fact policy disparate impact blacks because probationary discharges one hundreds possible claims probationary employees could there evidence and evidence another point race discrimination claims weve already alluded different kinds claims contract and youre comparing apples oranges talk race discrimination claim wage claim seniority claim proving case prove probationary discharge claim plaintiffs brought mass statistical anecdotal evidence the unions intended going process similar kind claim would time kind thing so youre things would complicate disparate impact analysis but plaintiffs made effort prove neither court based findings i think issue no probationers thats correct the court found proper representative initial assignment cases well know i say and i must confess your honor i dont recall court saying proper representative probationary employees but would almost follow one the reason court found proper representative initial assignment claim named plaintiffs working plant long statute limitations period began on rationale would but i cant say moment i actually recall language courts opinion saying in fact note passed said court appeals notwithstanding lucid argument i made said probationers represented were yes represented as ive already it it if court please id like reserve rest time rebuttal yes your honor with particular respect racial harrassment claim number one evidence whatsoever union admitted quote treating to policy raising race discrimination grounds our brief full i think every reference joint appendix every reference testimony policy could call stated it stated often plaintiffs witnesses unions witnesses every case based grounds grievance second there finding i union refused finding union refused process race discrimination grievances there finding reluctant grounds the court said that rationale wouldnt apply situation racial harrassment loss pay discipline but didnt make finding union fact policy and fact one issues would argue court appeals court appeals didnt reach vacated racial harrassment finding entire 12year period 13 instances racial harrassment brought unions attention 10 union took action and i want add one thing evidence also clear the union another means take care racial discrimination problems didnt involve contract provisions the contract provided joint unioncompany civil rights committee ideally suited purposed take care problems could handled grievance process werent particularly well suited thank you,298.0,354,23,we hear arguments next two consolidated cases no 851626 goodman lukens steel no 852010 united steelworkers goodman mr weinberg may proceed whenever youre ready mr weinberg third circuit deal theory liability one breach duty fair representation rather direct violation title vii section 1981 well deal theory i suppose did district court make finding union raised claims racial discrimination grievances well mr weinberg would contest union would guilty racial discrimination absolutely refused process grievances based racial grounds refused process didnt want process racial grievances yes well union could inferred could racial animus inferred fact never processed racial grievance dont well event i think recitation facts that claim found favor district court was there finding union refused process grievance racial grievance well wasnt another ground well ever file racial grievance wasnt ground and found found district court well court appeals affirm basis that district court used what district court found union failed present race discrimination claims could racially discriminating black people white people reason failing simply lack expertise were used seniority claims used race discrimination claims would state violation unions duty see that might say might easier ground prove complicated job relatedness ground mr weinberg district court made finding relative title vii claim unions method practices processing employee grievances disparate impact blacks i asked trial court made finding thats entirely clear is substantial body authority support the district court didnt make finding one way well title vii claim no would say that even fact proven assert proven except respect probationers perhaps union categorically would process racial discrimination grievances would well never mind categorically would and even proven effect inordinately disfavor blacks would violation thats youre saying3 why dont start saying yes explain yes i going ask whether think probationers well could amount disparate impact finding effect union didnt process claims whatever reasons probationary employees failure disparate impact many probationers discharged let go black we speaking courts based finding court appeals found proper representative probationers anyway so still worry probationer not were were it wasnt opponent handed note very well mr weinberg well hear mr ewing is specific finding contrary point thank mr weinberg the case submitted,1236.0,1396,23,mr chief justice may please court let i would first like address issues raised unions cert petition liability go issues raised cert petition statute limitations and let start elaborating little justice scalias benefit reasoning court appeals prima facie sounds quite puzzling the plaintiffs contended discrimination discharges generally and several named plaintiffs discharged lukens on examining evidence district court found couldnt find discrimination generally discharges discharges respect probationary employees find discrimination and since court appeals said since issue presented legitimately plaintiffs right standing present issue discrimination discharges satisfied standing problem subissue probationary discharges our argument union liability three basic points first disagree strongest terms unions position district court find discrimination handling grievances the district court find unions discriminated ground race intentionally showing reluctance file grievances alleging racial discrimination racial discrimination provisions collective bargaining agreement reluctance shown respect provisions collective bargaining agreement no well yes sense district court want considerable dicussion intent necessary find violation 1981 including term racial animus said unions had intentionally refused file grievances yes your honor thats right and time court held well court held anytime racial classification drawn that necessary intent necessary racial animus found yes your honor in hunter v ericson washington v seattle school district no 1 court held racial classification racial issues racial matters differently matters area racial classification there recall hunter v ericson case city akron passed charter amendment suspended fair housing ordinance said order adopt new fair housing ordinance would plebiscite and court held even though akron wasnt required fair housing ordinance treating fair housing issue differently regulation real estate transactions violated fourteenth amendment equal protection clause the district court found union intent treat violations nondiscrimination clause collective bargaining agreement differently clauses collective bargaining agreement well suggests in paragraph began saying situation is far one mere passivity went suggest reason either wanted avoid antagonizing white members wanted increase chance success grievances employer issues but position i feel strongly courts decisions uphold discrimination defined making difference treatment intentional discrimination making intentional difference treatment and draw racial classification treat people differently basis racial classification intentional discrimination courts decisions yes your honor palmore v sadatti court struck decision florida court removing white child custody mother mother married black man and court said recognize the reason florida court gave theres social stigma attached interracial families doesnt justify creating racial classification thats right justice stevens with employer yes your honor well district court found union employer avoided addressing discrimination claims employees thats true thats true your honor but still situation carried similar course conduct resulted perpetuating discriminatory environment crosses burned people wore kkk armbands work racially derogatory grafitti appeared throughout plant the i think back justice stevens question whether motive matters real estate broker black customers showing houses decides avoid certain white neighborhoods hes found experience shows black homebuyers houses neighborhoods houses suddenly taken market maybe violence results and doesnt show black homebuyers he finds houses neighborhoods integrated neighborhoods black neighborhoods maybe white neighborhoods progressive the results customers may good terms find houses theyre satisfied seems theres still discrimination broker thats right your honor thats right no i in example i gave real estate brokers no i looking motive question whether motive relevant but still discrimination when process claims process claims they filed 8000 8000 grievances thats ratio almost two day under c1 that discrimination the union may discriminate here union discriminated thats right the union treated members complaints employer discrimination differently way treated member complaints primarily disparate treatment argument they really overlap we show union treated claims differently claims discrimination differently claims disparate impact also because district court found perpetuated discriminatory environment not in statistics your honor least union so its hard we draw distinction we put evidence primarily disparate treatment your honor i think government unions wrong say prove disparate impact because prove yes justice oconnor district court found yes your honor on page union petitioners appendix page 138a district court stated the clear preference company unions avoid addressing racial issues served perpetuate discriminatory environment yes your honor the court appeals said but went we believe thats correct necessary decision case because district court found court appeals affirmed said something different mere passivity yes your honor as long affirm court appeals issue the the issues probationary employees testing unions made lot argument well grieved testing grounds job relatedness rather violation discrimination clause but fact least year case filed beginning limitations period union filed one grievance testing job relatedness ground either whole battery tests so years except one grievance manning new facility employer manning new facility years wunderlicht test common use employer daytoday use unions grieve either job relatedness ground discrimination grounds similarly respect probationary discharges union said well didnt grieve probationary discharges thats across board but ground could grieved probationary discharges discrimination otherwise employer full discretion discharge employees probationary period so failure grieve probationary discharges seen another aspect reluctance almost total failure grieve discrimination aspect oh half people discharged probationary period white it blacks 50 percent whereas third hired half discharged not im aware your honor but ground could grieve probationary discharges discrimination otherwise employer thats right the contract gave basically seniority rights rights respect discharge presumably probationary employee worked overtime wasnt paid overtime yes would violation contract could grieved behalf probationary employee the district court found now stated testimony district courts findings context question grievances discharges probationary employees but even aside union claimed claimed give priority discharges grievances discharges suspensions so probationary employees discharged different kind situation whatever minor grievances probationary employees might and even though claimed give priority to grievances discharge suspensions didnt give priority didnt grieve probationary discharges could grieved account race the union wrong say district court found discrimination grievance handling process what district court found grievances filed moving second third step arbitration could find grievances black employees treated differently grievances white employees but went say plaintiffs firmer ground however respect complaint unions discriminated failing grieve discrimination claims if case discharge no case discharge union would grieve but would put race large there cases put large admitted reluctant basically district court found reluctant file racial discrimination grievances they avoided wherever possible yes your honor yes and instances yes your honor he found i dont know whether well yes district court found unions position would grieve grounds could failed take account numerous instances racial harrassment grounds grieve in particular case your honor the district court well i wasnt sure whether question yes your honor but district court didnt specify cases opinion record yes i believe i beg pardon justice marshall well yes your honor the district court rejected unions claim reason didnt file discrimination claims could get better results means and said i find explanation unacceptable in first place overlooks numerous instances harrassment indisputably racial nature otherwise plainly violate provision collective bargaining agreement thus grievances involving loss pay permanent disciplinary record virtually ignored this page 138a unions petitioners appendix thats finding and says second place seems obvious vigorous pursuit claims racial discrimination would focussed attention upon racial issues compelled change racial attitudes and goes say the employers failure unions failure grieve racial discrimination served perpetuate discriminatory environment if court please i would like go statute limitations question briefly wilson v garcia three holdings first 42 usc section 1988 provides requires federal law govern characterization claims violations civil rights acts statute limitations purposes second section 1988 instead looking allegations individual case court look history purpose statute question select one appropriate characterization actions statute and third following one two appropriate characterization claims section 1983 claims personal injury now unions claim let look issue retroactivity i suspect i wont get thats right your honor well first place court appeals affirmed district district courts findings union so obviously didnt think effect no what court appeals found racial harrassment evidence remaining reduce limitations period sufficient evidence employer tolerated racial harrassment its toleration racial harrassment employer constitutes violation title vii section 1981 and reason found proved toleration racial harrassment anecdotal testimony many instances employer complaints made employer racial harrassment didnt anything or even supervisory employees even way somehow endorsed with respect unions however complaints made unions the unions admitted policy treating complaints racial matters differently complaints and therefore necessary build accumulation instances tolerated racial harrassment no no limitation district courts finding district court found the testimony the testimony the testimony supports district courts finding union reluctant avoided submitting racial discrimination grievances and neither testimony district courts finding limited situations grounds pin grievances thank you,590.0,797,43,did district court say union decision motivated racial animus well course i take it wasnt inadvertent part they intentionally refuse file but reason racially motivated one xxx racial grievance isnt different isnt different saying refusal process based racial animus no weve said racial classification people drawn weve never said racial classification arguments i mean one thing discriminate against race people its another thing discriminate racial argument say i dont like argue basis race discrimination i better arguments thats race discrimination its racial argument discrimination well earlier question mr ewing factual one rather legal one i interested finding exactly sort intent district found union yes i suppose would obvious action did go say reason policy racial animus well consciously knowingly something intentional view without regard motive if union consciously adopts policy processing racial grievances whatever motive intentional discrimination yes mr ewing youre giving statutory issue and position i want sure court appeals opinion refers union intentionally avoids asserting discrimination claims either antagonize employer desire white membership liable statute and position i take statute doesnt make bit difference unions reason intentionally avoiding asserting discrimination claims even union could prove long run wise union policy resulted success many many grievances would say thats still per se violation statute i wanted sure i view let also answer respect making constitutional argument statutory claim this court pointed steele v louisville  nashville railroad emporium capwell cases situation union similar governmental entity respect rights responsibilities members regarding equal protection and union exclusive bargaining right members therefore equal obligation i think steele said least strong obligation governmental entity treat members discrimination xxx cases two working together brotherhoods working employees discriminate negroes and thats 0 xxx there open shop you may entirely right mr ewing the point i well two points really one purposes addressing argument assume motive first two alternatives improving chance success issues wont weaken argument slightest we dont assume perceived desires white majority and second point though even example give comes within different statutory language the statutory language must come within cause attempt cause discrimination right at least respect title vii requirement i mean title vii claim based language statute or youre talking 1981 yes right i understand its relevant yes let say assume i agree thats discrimination which subsection 703c discrimination violate oh thats 1 i see i see exclude expel membership otherwise discriminate membership you say comes otherwise discriminate i see xxx disparate disparate treatment argument well never mind did seek make disparate impact case so rely rely disparate treatment theory well relying support a disparate treatment analysis well finding district court disparate impact can show tell record i would find well thats thats finding disparate impact view well i take didnt court appeals hold union affirmative duty combat employer discrimination are defending statement why isnt so right agree agree nevertheless disaffirm court appeals said affirmative duty union did evidence show probationary dischargees black and any white probationary grievances claims grieved the contract gave probationers rights let sure i understand you say contract gave probationers rights because i understood opponent say hundreds grounds grievances behalf probationers one large universe didnt enforce which right but give rights and correct district court found union uniform policy processing grievances probationers you think theres square finding facts record indicate black person comes union says i fired im black wasnt promoted im black i want grievance union says i understand claim i doubt thats employer going file grievance we dont discriminate the union says dont race dont want make employer mad were going file now findings like well kind grievances refuse file altogether would racial grievances well may well they actually instances actually refused file grievance racial grievance and district court find had filed none because grievance racial grieve matter thats i asked well findings that union wouldnt file grievance racial grievance yes thats kind well specific cases union refused file grievance racial grievance well dont read us findings youre talking why dont read findings you keep talking theories solid point i suspect youd read 0 xxx sorry interrupt i question may get youve argued brief and question i dont think ill get brief youve referred several times failure grieve racial harrassment claims anything now understanding court appeals vacated district courts determination employer regard racial harrassment now doesnt automatically take racial harrassment case union well well find racial harrassment blame union failing grieve racial harrassment did admit even basis claim racial one wouldnt grieve i thought admitted wouldnt wouldnt include matters they grieved im talking finding im talking admission union referred you say union admitted wouldnt bring harrassment claims and understanding admitted would bring racial claims claims available grieve action taken i dont understand admitted would bring harrassment claim thing

California,71-1192,93074400.0,109227600.0,Goldstein,California,5.0,4.0,0,1537.0,2361,12,thank your honor mr chief justice may please court the question presented case whether state california right state use criminal laws enact effect copyright sound recordings i would credit effect copyright goes federal copyright ever gone could ever go provisions article i section 8 clause 8 constitution yes your honor somewhat confusing the federal statute required  prior public law 9214 required anyone wished underlined musical composition i mean work composer usual assigned publishing house anyone wish use could upon payment two cents per use that mean made album might make 12 uses sold thousand albums make 12000 uses pay two cents composer use song could  composer could stop anyone making use song long use record but title 17 sections 1e 101e existed part public law 92140 once anyone allowed make recording sound recording called composer license provisions came effect anyone else could make called similar use paying statutory royalty two cents filing required notice intent use no your honor it would paid publishing house composer we divide difference composer performing artist we two separate interests involved one would interest composer man writes song a verdi opera instance verdi would one interest performer performed recorded performance would another interest those two separate indistinguishable interests as matter fact your honor i think congress passed law 1909 remained essentially unchanged public law 92140 became effective february 15th year what congress said part committee report accompanied that1909 law intention committee extend right copyright mechanical reproductions give composer copyright proprietor control accordance provisions bill manufacture use devices i think universally accepted  no your honor connection 1909 act original act the new  new bill legislative history involved new bill setup extent reply brief and i call your honors attentions portion reply brief commence page four discusses legislative intent because question come whether public law 92140 way intended change prior legislative history by argued respondent somehow congress public law 92140 intended authorize states enact legislation similar california statute as point brief think absolutely contrary level statute says shall effect –  previous law sound recordings recorded prior public law 92140 and also upon legislative history expressed committee report one point committee report quotes sets letter justice department justice department said bill apply retroactively section 3 section 3 new law public law 92140 expressly states construed affecting way – right respect selling recordings fixed date end your honor respect sound recordings fixed published public law 92140 would presumably covered federal copyright and i think even state must concede either theyre covered federal copyright theyre covered i would think question your honor they direct conflict the federal provides 28 years copyright plus 28 years important states provide limitation it goes perpetually in event importance case limited events rights arguably fixed passage federal law i  i think wanted enlighten facts directly front court correct the sound recordings subject case recorded quite clearly provided february 15 1972 law – thats could law reports already fact proof the conviction already entered long february 15 1972 effect new law provide  idea argue think congress makes clear effect new law establish period experiment in fact exactly committee report states the committee report states could end act provides sound recordings recorded special time subsequent february 15 1972 later december 31 1974 entitled copyright protection limited time copyright protection duplication kind act involved case congress said reason they needed time examine possibilities alternatives towards solution  ultimate solution copyrights areaone solution suggested i see your honor i one people suggested congress time theyll composer licensing provision similar  mr chief justice provision previous law new law respect composers rights necessarily limited two cents course called composer licensing provision the congress decided needed time study problem we suggest that kind time kind congressional intent mooted decision court certainly decision court states right enact permanent perpetual monopoly protection simply  i think theyre honor i believe 10 states course side coin 40 states and – i think  i think though amicus recording industry association america alluded fact spent great deal money least theyve spent great deal time attempting establish laws yes your honor florida statute course subject course roofing court declared unconstitutional almost identical statute yes your honor already spent  states i position say important record industry states but  basically law tennessee one distinction  laws i believe make misdemeanor i think tennessee makes felony they criminal law yes your honor i  i would point  one problems state laws rose federal law copyright laws patent laws the ultimate goal dedication public court said and i believe  moment sears case mrsskipper thus patent system one uniform federal standards carefully used promote invention time preserving free competition i  i really see anyone could say state laws system uniform federal standards quite clearly contrary they something uniform federal standardsfurther i think quite obvious promote competition however contrary avoid purpose met patent laws copyright laws article 1 section 8 clause even constitution yes your honor i definitely saying i think court said repeatedly i think court said sears compco cases if court said protection must come federal government recall i believe court cited us madison federalist no43 madison said state  states cannot make effectual protection copyrights patents it uniform national scale it whit respect composers rights that way works your honor the  under  oth old act new act payment must made according statute directly copyright proprietor that copyist duplicator make payment original record company record company forward payment copyist  excuse composer the copyist must make payment directly composer section 1e thats correct 101e payments go directly there specific protections provided federal law protections must followed copyist violation federal law if  follow protections subject civil suits public law 92140 new law subject criminal penalties also well one provisions law your honor  yes mr justice black opinion cases especially counter case specifically referred   copyright protections yes your honor and  respondents made distinction they say one copy lamp one takes lamp one lamp one somehow appropriates sound recording that distinction i confess escapes it distinction without factual difference the distinction leads us remedy solution one wants make copy rembrandt painting one must make free hand sketch rembrandt painting but take photographic copy thats mechanical reproduction somehow lost rights rembrandt jumped public domain protected presumably  i dont want make arguments show i recall referred us “oh god argument” presumably one wants copy rembrandt one must go find heirs rembrandt want make photograph protections according state law last perpetuity there limitations kind provisions dedication rights public now  i think would unconstitutional clauses your honor i think  article i section 8 clause 8 brand authority brand power congress read connection madisons federalist i think makes clear possible i believe going back banks case banks versus manchester way back 1888 i believer court held  power make copyrights vested constitution within congress i think  i think dont even find case i think cruel legislative intent expressed number years 1909 though 1972 redefine rights copyright law dont find rights i think one example fact 31 separate occasions recording industry brought congress introduced congress legislation would made sound recordings subject copyrighting and occasion failed there one occasion cited i believe petition matter came judiciary committee house judiciary committee provision intact amended floor house that provision amended and request remanded joined chairman committeei think clear congress simply want grant protection the states come along said “well mistake congress made mistake sound recordings protection simply cannot must protection after pointed california great state good feels sound recording industry new york tennessee brings people state entertainers protect if congress going leave give protection post february 15 1972 sound recordings brought protection prior recordings going to something congress simply wrong it petitioners position states right say congress wrong area the congress defines public domain i believe may your honor there  i see professor inaudible taken position may seems decide something public domain february 14 1972 february 15 jumps public domain i believe court said graham versus john deere that cant happen well i certain mean “taking advantage of” the copyist opinion copyist made copy yes your honor not respect recordings fixed published prior february 15 1972 that correct your honor because already indicate and  act specifically states reply  applies sound recordings fixed published fixed published february 15 1972 i suggest your honor  necessary requirement going back abuses  thank i  yes your honor i think  that exactly correct your honor we  believe deception though passing one applied ones product anothers product states may control but i point quite clearly statute involved labeling held  product labeled nothing commission crime involved the crime committed product manufactured resale sold it doesnt matter labeled could barely label crime in words  simple act copying public domain federal law respondents  cannot public domain put public domain protection i suggest thats secure argument to say something doesnt fall public domain simply falls public domain protection know i think judge hand made  judge learned hand point least four separate cases spanning early 1930s 1950s he said case statute originators thats  socalled dress piracy design piracy judge hand said “you either get federal protection protection copyist free go ahead copy dress designs” and pointed  rule otherwise would step  would really negate federal law allow states decide publication principally responded argues the responded argues state free common law copyright doctrines section 2 copyright act protect unpublished works responded argues withstanding fact albums sell million two million copies therefore used commercially exploit conscious delivered effort commercially exploit fullest extent possible sound recordings nevertheless recordings  public domain as judge hand said “what could done place items public domain” everything possibly done commercial exploit done suggest  recording companies respect prefebruary 15 1972 recordings put test wish commercially exploit everyone else cannot get patent cannot get copyright they benefit public court held interest public override interest artist inventor performer troubles anyone i think remembered law patent area years years always law patent area inventor may spend whole life resources inventing and cannot bring within federal patent laws makes dedication work public soon discloses public he gets patent protection gets protection gets clear reasoning  thats  way unless going add  excuse going uniform national patent copyright laws yes your honor i suggesting i think  i say way assured two things one uniform national copyright law so thats something  capable copied washington also copied new york capable copied new jersey also copied new york thats way assure the second way assure ever dedication publicit remembered state laws last perpetuity in fact go way beyond congresses even authorize experimental periodcongress said “you copyright 28 years perhaps extend 28 years” the state california says “you copyright perpetuity exact kind copyright it cannot longer argued state protecting duplication exactly federal law it protects duplication it protect socalled imitation the state california effect simply extend it given boost federal lawit simply says “were going take products extend protection perpetuity” now another argument made apparently  private amicus least recording industry association america rules proposed petitioners court overrule lower court would destroy recording industry and i think absolutely evidence theres reason believe they protectionwe talking sound recordings recorded prior february 15 1972 some sound recordings go back  copied though necessarily involved case certainly gone around country  indicated amicus brief filedsome recordings date back prewar presecond world war recordings nevertheless california statutes statutes protected protection simply goes and i see time i save time rebuttal mr chief justice may please court i would first like state i concur 653h nothing taping public performance and important remember talking something copies attempts copy something contend dedicate public domain important it commercially exploited fully i think thats differ completely we remember talking something constitutionally subject copyright its watch wrist watch something writing within definition constitution i would point going way back 1950 1952 i believe new york first attempted pass statute california statute veto governor dewey because governor dewey said something left congress also stated veto message that exactly we situation concern basically questions balance rights state federal government copyright clause point sears compco quite clearly state cases matter covered copyright patents exploited commercially falls public domain maybe used anyone this sounds recordings take issue learned counsel sound recordings unique they way different photograph photograph painting want make copy painting best clearest way make photograph if want make copy pull lamp best clearest way make copy pull lamp make plaster paris mold if want make copy book best clearest way make copy book make photographic offset printing now also suggested  yes your honor the book copyright  exactly your honor sound recordings copyright that exactly point that point court sears compco the pole lamps patent copyright therefore could copied the rembrandt copyrighted therefore copied this court relied heavily learned hands decision inaudible versus handler decision  courts decision sears compco no your honor i  i think i see point your honor writing youre saying  youre talking owner physical   rembrandt opposed rights inaudible rights deal copy they could absolutely could thats exactly sound recording industry it could charge recording 5 if national gallery wanted sell rembrandt 100000 surely i right make photographs that attempted your honor in rca victor versus whiteman i believe another learned hands decision us sound recording industry attempted put restrictive covenant learned hand pointed simply cant you could put restrictive cover struck to quite frank matter raised knowledge since belief probably reasons express learned hand could done but fact try emphasize states gone congress go even congress cannot grant protection unlimited times the constitutional clause quite clear it says promote progress science useful arts securing limited time authors inventors exclusive right respective writings discoveries congress given job balancing much long protection granted specific item falls within constitutional definition writing they chosen areas grant seven years protection years chosen grant 17 years protection areas chosen grant 28 years protection in areas theyve always said dedicated public good i would point congress make decision congress hasnt decided grant copyright protection states cannot grant longer protection thank you,324.0,402,22,mr leeds may proceed whenever youre ready it help outset mr leeds i  help get  clarify situation existed recent federal statute im thinking case shapiro bernstein remington records back second circuit 1956 1957 dealing two cents per record copyright under kind statute two cents required paid anyone copied record this statutory royalty paid first recording company would well connection new bill i dont – what so state – state law become inoperative postfederal law as i saw many amicus groups  many doesnt pay they inaudible apparently states recording industries pretty large economic impact state tennessee new york california tennessee new york california and argues basically laws one involve case  but criminal laws it unconstitutional state declare unfair competition stranger simply copies recording made major company company engaged artist perhaps paid musician work arrangement hired equipment done work necessary produce recording and saying state cant put limitation people simply making copy taking advantage expense incurred does new act contain kind compulsory provision maintained line act well composers  clarify composers rights protected copier paid two cents per record master recording company master recording company must account artists under new act you involved  anywhere patents i understand the sears case copying lamp kind mr leeds chief justice asked certain statute action unconstitutional said yes would do think state act deserves unconstitutional virtue supremacy clause would unconstitutional virtue patent clamp congress constitution even congress never implemented authority ground well could i ask clarify say sound recording made prior day new act comes along new act person made sound recording wants take advantage federal law old recording may well  saying may take is  position may take advantage new federal law after person  made recording may seek protection federal law because already indicate dont think i want  dont need argue i wanted know opinion fact state laws kind long statutes statutory law involving unfair competition  it something like coming deception are saying  way recording companies protected get trying get congress authorize copyrighting recording distinguished material thats recorded very well mr leeds mr schacter but cant quite freely well copyright but copy rembrandt permission owner right i copy go take photograph something national gallery art except leave right but national gallery could charge wanted 100 every person taking photograph 1 in selling anyway could put limitation copying thank gentlemen the case submitted hear arguments next rosario ,1417.0,1800,13,thank your honor mr chief justice may please court there one issue court in state california prevent appropriation recordings fixed february 15 1972 therefore protectable federal law there court question concurrent state federal protection interpretation federal statute public law 92140 petitioners pled nolo contendere june 28 1971 appropriating recordings date prior enactment federal statute there moral issue policy issue case as pointed chief justice record company make recording must first go one hand person rights words music they obtain licensed use words music from point go side argument the recorded company words music nothing must go hire recording studio they must go hire artists arrangers copyist engineers record producers you must pay money immediately upon making record union pension plans music performance trust funds and money extended make record disc must promoted covers must made money must spent advertising and still guarantee that record hit revenue come then even records sold upon sale record record company must take money back give artists performers top union funds provide prepublic performances throughout country now pirate the pirate goes store buys record 3 4 that extent investment artistic composition he performancehe goes makes says “copies” really are duplicate originals this unique thing something different anything here types items existed case this item pirate puts there nothing front eighttrack stereo bottom continuous play back says “dont put close heat going good” but thing public sees what thing public buys in front says “sergio mendes crystal illusions” name artist name performance program one program two program three program four exact performances legitimate tape so taken hes taking plastic hes taking acetate hes taking performance public goes buys no the pirate pays i underlined  heres obligation prior 1972 pay two cents cup side composition that means words music he pays nothing massive investment taken produce records he doesnt pay artist the composer yes your honor the artist one shall say sings plays instruments the whole orchestration right the composer correct yes under 1909 act little teeth given write february 15th composer already always protection what talking individuals companies unions made performance protection except state common law rights and look forward  much applied end result are going say theres complete forfeiture everything or protection words equitable reasoning behind well second part california statute states also crime california sell inaudible performances without consent owner they couldnt sold california i think 40 states statutes depending court decides protection afforded performers prior february 15 1972those states probably used unfair competition civil litigation it end result skin accepted importantare going allow taking goes without retribution in basis statute 653h your honor comes common law copyright means performance dedicated words sell record remaining people state california there dedication record play that reason no  well talking leads record show presently new act protective  we protecting artist performer unions all people obtained moneys sale record well record company pays money yes and promoter we protecting since state california  well essence is property right i property right watch now congress comes tells i dont right anymore watch mine forever i purchased store moment i pay store eventually going go back man perhaps sat smaller table worked real well  no no your honor  no i dont agree reasonyou said i made copy watchnow might true copy we original this unique thing almost i fantastic machine i dropped watch another watch came molecularly exact thats unique thing  well problem first difference copyrighting pen idea unfair competition essence  call bootleg tape put allowed tapes would exist put performer forgetting composer we talking performer we put performer competition there nothing unfair and worse hes competition doesnt get anything that great inequities well making  yes protection also  lets say lead singer album obtains money making album now moneys obtain depend sale albumyou also working men working musician working vocalist you  dont see name anywhere his money comes sale  money comes first money record company pay union pensions funds at second money comes sale record thats right also well would individual natural circumstances  excuse let correct i think id correct thats also correct  absolutely your honor but even show theres one equity perhaps point there book written make money music industry talked three companies am records started 200 garage motown records started ghetto detroit duck records started tennessee all people started limited funds all go talent now companys went every time put many failures able get one hit one hit enough bring enough moneys make hits but upon making one hit somebody freeze profit money that man could never survive people make performances anything else make money take away commerce going to culturally deprived i saw reason the present federal act good three years so court declared 653h unconstitutional course protection federal protection prior 1972 for performance well it  way going back history period years perhaps 1930s amendments made advise complete copyright act had suggested im sorry within revisions  attempted revisions protection performances but revisions struck total protections thats  i think  stated briefs needed time proprietors  whatever needed  i supposed clue made sooner later original copyright act there attempted claims no copyright act  specifically give protection performers it didnt say negative wasnt its perfectly clear wasnt and void theres voidness voidness full the repeated request congress  until 1972 repeated request part complete revision i mean complete revision fell fell this problem realistically speaking 1960s became cute tape appropriating material easy take tape make another one another duplicate original as say house reports experiment gave protection this  first time piecemeal legislation put forward done said i “we persuading problem immediate urgent one legislation deal needed now” the terminology overdue no told congress  true your honor federal preemption if i may comment your honor instance compco specific way obtain protection in words either patent protection mechanical design didnt we dont copyright way even bring something forward patent copyright act musical performances absolutely declare compete forfeiture performances made prior 1972 correct no void restored 1972 federal okay 1972 void filled common law right and common law right saying sale record cause published and state statutes like california within states idea unfair competition as i said became problem became easily accessible take products put market but must brought court cannot make supposition going happen 1975 present federal protection lapses and lapses one going make performance no one going make record belief soon might obtain type profit going taken away and would great cultural determent country the pirates give nothing take the unlimited times doctrine congress power copyright act state  court well aware congress shall it  always presumed record recording writing congress affirmatively acts uses power take something place ring power comes existence and different analogy watch yes your honor congress affirmatively acted cannot consider something would  know void no one argue pirate socially economically beneficial society in fact reports senate house registered copyrights attorney general commerce department state department reports throughout country state legislatures say piracy economically harmful and i refer house senate reports really state word use legislation long overdue there substantial interest state california police power promote general prosperity to protect general prosperity state must legislate protect legitimate business would destroy business now stated brief set 1850 california general self statute generalizing statute but business came state necessary refine statutes give specific businesses protection would prey upon one example 1939 california enacted felony statute deciduous fruits avocados the reason 30s somebody went drove along road came avocado patch picked couple avocados one cared but avocados went open market 50 75 cents piece middle night man truck loading three four trucks would wipe complete growth necessary california enact specific legislation protect businesses to protect businesses people worked commerce derived piracy anti  excuse 653h create monopoly there many small record companies i told am anyone use words music anyone use idea expression make record wish put capital investment sounds like another record on public performance i think could go specifically back common law copyright inaudible public performance dedicate artists right ascap separate perhaps contractual relations could talking public performance and 653h deals record word performance fixed something taken point not 653h would violating probably unfair competition contractual rights yes your honor well performer usually contracts away rights practically speaking record company so record  its record capitol records v erickson california bring injunctive procedures civil criminal remedies the realistic fact injunctive procedures prove adequate injunction could obtained individual would producers the producer could move jurisdiction keeps sending tapes state move  left trying find seller injunction would good different party and injunction could cover went jurisdiction thats necessary 653h prevent selling appropriation also selling piracy also anticompetitive it

complete inventory wiped made valueless compete someone puts identical original performance yet charges less onethird caused purchase whole sale only stronger would survive 653h stuck because record companies would force go piracy record companies big record companies like columbia rca capitol pressing plants tape plants could even pirate pirates could put product cheaper i believe two views concurrent   protection my view my view mechanics set record companies would best afford federal protection there separate ability clause 653h i would say i would say preemption no become public domain specific situation congress decided affirmatively used power go field what talking congress never went filled states must give protection congress affirmatively acts i see im running close end time i state briefly federal preemption february 5 1972 either express implied there always state law protection unpublished writings section 2 copyright act expressively inquotifies different patent this court recognized state protection sears case footnote 7 different patents specifically state protection patent publish always two definitions dual state federal the federal law determines invest

strike 653h underlying reasons behind declare rights investments performances made prior 1972 complete forfeitures that essence case pirates parasite upon industry allowed exist like parasite upon host destroy host public suffer yes your honor and  reasons i believe article 1 section 8 clause 8 congress affirmatively uses power material considered power void once power exercised congress gone field exists but must leave state even congress also stated section 2 copyright act referenced unpublished works and unpublished works state declare unpublished work says unpublished common law federal common law must presume inaudible i dont believe your honor i think question united states i might say courts people waiting determine going protections and i yes equitable argument equities case great thank much,413.0,534,39,its even pirate call  obligated pay artist two cents per use  taking obligation  so answer question yes the  composer well old orchestration  but composers  so answer question yes i suppose times usually take term pirates make copy recording public gets top 10 something kind they wait efforts originator produced good result but could prevent anything crossing line going nevada place setting copying process nevada doesnt statute like so couldnt sold california could sold 40 states dont statutes is californias basis unfair competition patent copyright but listed among things went trouble pressing record thats copyright inaudible copyright pressing record are protecting artist and else well inaudible pressed record and promoter the promoter new york if 49 states protecting it wouldnt run put much load horse but i make direct copy watch theres nothing the person think man made watch well would composer want start something else i would think could get patent when get paid singing doesnt get paid royalty there  but place take record music get artist run band go place make mass director pay one price sell 80 million records dont get anything i right trying protecting  if happens frank sinatra gets high price one performance would covers future but hes unknown person gets union rate we want know clear prior 1972 federal protection recorder for performance because courts rule covered copyright act had made  suggested but original copyright act courts decided protection  intended or perfectly clear original copyright act kind protection for half performance yes court proceedings constructions copy right act specifically negative then repeated request congress turned until 1972 i  i thought might relevant ask whether knowing deliberate federal decision prior 1972 extend kind protection the bassis argument federal preemption particular segment i know arguments base source compco by protection prevalent federal decision arguably copyright act read saying long protection composer thats enough whole scheme thing you said earlier nothing federal act protect form that void void filled now mean filled state laws yes i speaking 1972 and state statutes like california whats position pre1972 recordings light federal acts limitation 28 years so saying pre1972 common law copyrights perpetual even though post1972 recordings protected 28 years what taping one artists public performance would 653 prevent selling things made tape doesnt ascap take care so i tape public performance one artist sell prints i make tape i dont buy like 653h mr schacter i like get back common law civil remedies could injunction obtained piracy talking parties whos interest affected performer example the record  could record company join piracy  do agree that 1972 way get protection long federal act last seek federal protection what view that would best i know 653h could enforced no canada incidents 1972 and end 28 years  if seek federal protection recording set 1972 want protection say place get federal law you seek protection get itit expires end 28 years  public domain made state law give protection if

maritime law survival cause action predeath injuries nonseafarer conduct causes injuries occurs high seas whether survival cause action general maritime law may brought independent coexisting alongside death action death high seas act in order understand argument important point distinctions survival cause action wrongful death cause action as court stated several times survival cause action traditionally encompassed encompasses injuries individual sustained prior death time injury those traditionally encompassed predeath pain suffering loss earnings time injury time death medical associated expenses relating injuries time death in case court today petitioners right claim predeath injuries predeath pain suffering 12 minutes decedent suffered time aircraft upon passengers fired upon 12minute controlled descent sea japan ultimate deaths by comparison survival actions thats correct respondent response petition certiorari also agreed rule court court lay applied whenever conduct causes injuries ultimately causes death occurring high seas in typical accident probably boatbased fact patterns context case court arise airplane accident address predeath pain suffering

parent leaving small children loss parental services small children the beneficiaries different in survival cause action estate beneficiary holder individual injured persons claim death in wrongful death what occurred i believe justice ginsburg original fela patterned lord campbells act lord campbells act required cause action exist person time death right recover survival death the fela amended 1910 provide causes action the death high seas act yes justice ginsburg in michigan central railway v vreeland court said could survival action wrongful death action fela amended congress 1910 but basis wrongful death action fela based upon lord campbells act type statute required existence cause action decedent time death recovery survival could also death recovery in circumstance statute dealing death high seas act argument respondent amicus death high seas act precludes courts traditional development survival cause action it require existence cause action decedent prior death foreclosure survival cause action alongside wrongful death cause action the issue respondent government bring regard death high seas act whether enacting wrongful death remedy congress intended foreclose courts traditional role maritime actions develop law policies change theres nothing wrongful death act death high seas act would foreclose well limited degree justice kennedy congress

whole the death high seas act enacted statute limitations began run date wrongful conduct typical wrongful death statutes statute limitations begin begins run date death what congress attempting section 765 say injured person lived past 2year statute wrongful death right would abated beneficiaries 2 years run peculiarity beginning date wrongful conduct instead wrongful death the courts in case directly court courts addressed issues commentators time subsequently said section 765 best deemed nonabatement section survival section happened section 9 765 remedy turned wrongful death remedy heirs beneficiaries decedent could recover wrongful death damages nothing said statute happened injured persons predeath injuries addressed and congress silent predeath injuries court elects capacity develop general maritime law address predeath injuries survival cause action and read context attempting achieve congress attempting achieve rightsgranting statute it wanted ensure wrongful conduct occurred high seas would conduct would compensation wrongfulness conduct one injured well could read way justice souter i believe look historical background congress trying achieve that effectuates remedial effects and legislative history hard decide pardon just language then i suggest look language section 763a new statute limitations enacted 1980 as i mentioned earlier original section 763 provided 2year statute limitations begin date wrongful conduct in 1980 congress repealed section 763 inserted section excuse enacted section 763a it cover causes action general maritime law death high seas act jones act changed statute one statute began begin run date wrongful conduct begins run cause date cause action accrues extended statute 3 years three issues but anything said language congress ever may indicated 1920 didnt recognize survival actions death actions brought together least 1980 saying knew two kinds actions one could brought concurrently and clear legislative history 7 section 763a prompting mechanism certainly clear time courts begun develop along lines along ken rationale court moragne general maritime law survival causes action based upon rationale the harrisburg whether rightly decided decided originally underpinnings changed policy changed jurisprudence changed wholesale acceptance wrongful death causes action united states under analysis many federal appellate courts found general maritime law survival cause action result policy change jurisprudence united states widespread adoption survival statutes amongst states well federal level the lower courts many commentators said legislative history jones act clear provision survival cause action jones act solely wholesale incorporation fela we look statute arguably respondent one precludes court general maritime law analysis determine policy survival cause action death high seas act argument survival cause action there survival language statute statute addresses wrongful death remedies therefore void left court may fill survival cause action mr chief justice congress granted certainly remedies deaths high seas what discuss remedies survival high seas look courts traditional preemption preclusion procedures unless congressional statute specifically preempts precludes court developing common law remedies court particularly traditional role maritime matters right develop feels proper policy better law for proposition im sorry couple parts im sure the cases reply brief your honor deal preemption context statutes the common fact circumstance comes appears preemption context state laws common law remedies state laws medtronics which common law excuse your honor general maritime law species common law judgemade law then closest case context issue moragne case court said congress legislated far outward 3mile limit gone territorial water jurisdiction death high seas act court free develop common law federal under federal common law aegis identify general maritime law right recover wrongful death that context arguing congress address survival cause action death high seas act since remedies different dont overlap court capacity develop common law survival cause action predeath remedies well congress enacted death high seas act 1920 true common law right survivorship personal injury actions since using rationale court used moragne court capacity develop survival cause action predeath injuries because unless court finds theres general maritime law survival cause action recovery predeath injuries occur date injury date death someone injured high seas regardless extent injury regardless length time injury death serious serious significant large there two responses justice scalia inquiry the first person survives lengthy amount time incurs significant expenses medical care loss earnings chance compensated injuries death wouldnt survival action debts still part estate paid heirs compensation wrongdoer and second part i respectfully disagree respondent times wrongful death beneficiaries death high seas act any time young person killed teenager college student earning history has parents potential economic support time elderly people social security killed leave adult surviving children time couple killed together airplane accident leave minor children wrongful death beneficiaries death high seas act the factual circumstances today many many instances wrongful death beneficiaries death high seas act in there cases arise korean air lines accident that issue pain suffering petitioners cases court i think many circumstances could shown the bodden case example fifth circuit case mr bodden seriously injured engine explosion engine fire engine explosion ship and died 3 years afterwards im sorry fact pattern following along response inquiry im sorry but certainly statistics referred well issue evolution predeath pain suffering survival action claim around long time it raised court miles v apex context jones jones act seaman court referred opinion development common law survival cause action lower courts thats true twice court refused approve disapprove use state survival actions deaths occur high seas thats back kernan offshore logistics v tallentire so courts prohibited court refusal disapprove conduct applying state survival causes action deaths occur high seas may actions compensated state survivals courts apply in case however action clearly far beyond argument state survival statute that correct theres bill pending 2 years it bill effectuated drafted result twa 800 accident crashed new york because large number passengers board flight survival cause action death high seas act applied parents young kids group schoolchildren pennsylvania would compensation higginbotham decide issue issue whether general maritime law whether general maritime law death action could superimposed death high seas act death action but thats wrongful death action idea behind death high seas act general maritime law remedy the survival action parallel its like two columns they different remedies they different and dont they dont overlap language because verbs nouns used wrongful death remedies except survival i suggest court argument 765 really nonabatement provision survival action prohibition doesnt change cause action predeath injury remedies it keeps wrongful death remedies it currently im sure many reiterations changing quite lot its nowhere near far i know passed the primary focus it would remove airplane accident cases death high seas act some thats one reasons quite fixed its sure traditional choice law analysis its sure would law place airplane took there sorts proposals pending it would state law however would get decided as best i know currently pending,583.0,837,32,well hear argument number 97704 philomena dooley v korean airlines ms madole madole ms madole the case course since survive involve survivors action could mean much there would cases people would linger years substantial injuries et cetera ms madole i think court generally familiar difference wrongful death act survival act getting nub problem i understand fela originally survival aspect court declined create claim it left congress congress took care why shouldnt follow pattern but i wrong thinking attempt amendment get courts recognize survival claim railroad workers and wasnt death high seas act wasnt modeled lord campbells act well consider significant congress aware survival provisions federal employers liability act incorporate i mean thats significant fact case well course congress 42 us code section 765 deal death plaintiff whats recoverable extent congress certainly addressed subject i guess hard see congress entirely silent would happen claims predeath injuries 765 im reading rightly converts preexisting action predeath injuries solely kind death claim allowed statute sounds though saying everything except claim allowed statute goes away but thats wanted i would thought 765 would said wrongful death action may added preexisting personal injury action decedent begun didnt it effect said gets metamorphosed wrongful death case period but deal congress wrote someone thinks congress trying effectuate i mean i think deal language 765 deduce congress intended language 765 well get legislative history i say get legis does apply causes action those death high seas act doesnt cover jones act causes action might well explain language under jones act picks fela wrongful death relief survival thats rather circumscribed given congress done fela borrowing fela jones act court say well job fill survival act dohsa death high seas act legislation but one argue equally well i think perhaps better congress addressed question it decided sort damages recoverable death high seas isnt void congress granted withheld whats authority proposition that stated well preemption principles describe congress addressed one particular subject doesnt prevent courts developing common law policies may contrary related area at least thats i took proposition are talking preemption state laws what closest case support proposition talking i realize say theyre reply brief tell case would choose medtronics well thats preemption state law i dont well know congress passes common law doesnt exist it exists aegis either state federal government i recall medtronics court talking sort state law claims preempted federal statute isnt inquiry well species common law aegis state in words may definite reservations inclusive read federal statute preempting state law i dont think case youve cited far says reservations based essentially traditional federal system government respect states would carry statute enacted congress opposed federal remedies devised courts yes go ahead ms madole lets assume grant all establishes may but i mean cause action weve recognized past past created new say common law maritime causes action weve done areas congress displayed interest bringing intelligence bear upon matter here congress active i mean times changed said light changed circumstances it seems changed circumstances congress displayed much lively interest matters previous times gee didnt take initiative earlier times theres even less reason today seems im giving lets capacity why use capacity that persons hes gone hes dead gone i mean long survivors cause action death high seas act begun suit dies suit completed but ms may i ask question thats appealing argument seems unjust person suffers extensive harm hospital expense rest period the injury occurs person ultimately dies verdict comes but thing puzzles must happened many many times were talking huge area deaths injuries high seas caused deaths occurred case still pending yet dont cases i mean kind late day im puzzled issue hasnt arisen i dont know case points fact pattern are in oh okay oh im sure happens lot thing puzzles is 1998 statutes books since 1920 why suddenly confronted problem stage proceedings i mean stage history i meant well course survival actions justified statutes authorize survival common law claims i believe lord campbells act took care death action ms madole i understand congress considering bill would take aviation tragedies death high seas act another regime well supposed higginbotham that higginbotham seems support says admiralty courts often called upon supplement maritime statutes next sentence death high seas act however announces congress considered judgment issues beneficiaries et cetera survival damages says act courts free supplement congress acts congress addresses questions hasnt issue doesnt decide issue why isnt youre bite provides somewhat different class beneficiaries person dies provides whole beneficiaries money seems speak beneficiaries damages respect harm caused person dies no i understand theyre different remedies why isnt higginbotham relevant youre assuming knowledge higginbotham i the reason sentence i read determinative case ms madole may i ask would complete explaining congress as i understand congress knows existence problem proposed legislation would what proposed legislation passed would case handled but solution and put picking state law would i mean body law so would creating new counterpart death high seas act general it would picking law would state law thank ms madole mr harakas well hear is harakas harakas,732.0,1255,23,harakas mr chief justice may please court just pick justice ginsburgs questions regarding pending legislation back 1996 summer 96 pass congress passed bill house representatives would removed aviation cases death high seas act however also similar legislation pending house representatives would taken aviation cases set forth types recoverable damages under proposed bill senate bill 943 would say could recover damages state law damages available federal common law andor damages available death high seas act as see could create choiceoflaw nightmare types damages could recover however hearing last october recently last week senate hearing proposed legislation its markup one current versions proposed right may extended apply exclude aviation cases may amend death high seas act make generally applicable however even one current versions theres survival provision written act rather would allow nonpecuniary damages wrongful death provisions act type statutory cap if converts death high seas act generally lost wages would recoverable what would recover loss support loss inheritance combine two elements damages effect get lost wages lost future earnings with respect medical expenses kind interesting issue justice stevens said hasnt arisen well one reasons hasnt arisen youre dealing dohsatype actions mostly maritime context usually usually element settlement even recovery medical expenses viewed asset estate decedent 100000 20000 go pay medical expenses well youre depleting loss inheritance award way theyre recoverable part loss inheritance award i think look higginbotham note 20 higginbotham talked burial expenses whether theyre recoverable makes similar type analogy burial funeral expenses there recovery thats correct with respect territorial waters courts taken two well courts basically taken two approaches before calhoun decision courts would recognize general maritime survival action applicable territorial waters allow recovery way view calhoun decision state statutes always applicable would allow recovery applicable state statute provided survival statute respect territorial waters yes you would able recover additional damages territorial waters thats legislative scheme exists even wrongful death case higginbotham dealt exact situation respect loss society damages supreme court court gaudet found type damages recoverable general maritime law came higginbotham court said cant get general maritime law dohsa case congress set forth type damages recover theyve limited damages pecuniary losses and thats get case isnt real situation issue pecuniary versus nonpecuniary predeath pain suffering damages pecuniary it would require court recognize type damages allowed dohsa add estate beneficiary included dohsa in 1920 congress know difference wrongful death survival action opted adopt basically modified type wrongful death statute dohsa like lord campbells act it section 765 little different lord campbells act didnt contain provision i think look back 1920 congress thinking enacted dohsa well i think language death high seas act clear with time thought exclusive action this action available death high seas thats respect preemption issue addressed earlier context federal common law different preemption analysis apply state law when youre looking state law inherent police powers see affirmative intent preempt state statute respect congress enacts statute preemption federal common law analysis really congress speak issue and case congress speak issue damages death high seas act specifically deals issue issue whether affirmative prescription federal common law doesnt arise situation death high seas act deals issue well thats well respect death high seas act i dont think court would power different situation situation presented moragne there number critical factors moragne drove decision they addressed go back moragne case driving force moragne the driving force moragne recognition damages it recognition cause action unseaworthiness make unseaworthiness base liability uniform within class in addition your honor recognized moragne dealt issue territorial waters court looked congress enacted territorial waters withheld remedy dohsa extending territorial waters gap court could come fill but look decisions subsequent moragne higginbotham miles zicherman look see court made crystal clear congress spoken abide congress said congress spoken death high seas act respect pecuniary damages and take argument congress specifically say going allow loss survival damages time congress enacts dont enact dont legislate entire scheme theres always type hole point court come create remedy want well survival act well well dont get scotfree still wrongful death action well beneficiaries set forth dohsa ones closest decedent you parents spouse parents spouse children dependent relatives anyone whos close decedent even niece thinks dependent relative would entitled recover dohsa course survival action thats correct your honor even state law statutes draw lines recover well under typical state statutes look provisions jones act fela incorporated reference similar scheme dohsa respect estate doesnt recover personal representative recovers behalf certain named people exclusory class no if descent distribution laws someone would werent named would able recover recovery pain suffering thats correct with respect no well thats well fill hole work within congress im sorry well proper dohsa beneficiaries well types recover loss support well i respectfully disagree your honor i think moragne limited if court power moragne dealt different situation youre high seas congress legislated i think higginbotham recognized even moragne recognized supremacy maritime statutes thats correct because affirmatively set forth decided recoverable congress enacting dohsa said possible action death high seas act there general maritime law action time exactly well i think look well look structure im sticking language right 765 whats reason 765 there said theres personal injury action action shall essence cease subsumed dohsa action now wanted want allow survival type action wouldnt put language well i well thats it pretty clear go back i dont want get history right look records dohsa compromise it wasnt grant remedy none existed also interests shipowners in fact first version dohsa 5000 limit recoverable damages the difference survival provision jones act state statutes jones act section 59 sets forth survival 1910 amendments added survival provision it sets forth personal representative continue personal injury action decedent benefit certain named beneficiaries whereas state survival many state survival statutes says say personal injury action decedent shall continue estate recovers so whereas state statutes estate fiction decedent recovers jones act specific beneficiaries recover well various state statutes vary it depends state section 59 fela back brief page 7 act says right action given chapter person suffering injuries shall survive personal representative benefit surviving widow husband children employee none none employees parents none next kin dependent upon employee sets forth exactly recovers whereas state statutes recovery goes estate distributed oh respect damages recoverable whatever damages would recoverable personal injury action pain suffering damages recoverable your honor correct there ceiling none federal statutes currently type ceilings types recoverable damages monetary caps when look dohsa overall intended 1920 present day dohsa draw certain lines states lines based policy decisions made legislature congress today considering policy death high seas theyre considering various amendments death high seas act someone cant recover applicable statutes person allowed recover judgemade maritime law we stick strictly within boundaries set forth statute congress role the measure damages general maritime law actually its traditionally recognized personal injury actions injuries high seas and judgemade jones act deal jones act deal personal injuries death high seas act deal personal injuries one version proposed respect death high seas act would made dohsa akin fela would allowed recovery personal injuries soundly defeated 1916 today version currently enacted basically except repeal 763 1980 its version and i want make one point respect 763 that really isnt part 763a that isnt part death high seas act that statute general application congress enacted 1980 make uniform limitation period whether actions brought death high seas act maritime law whether death act personal injury action codified 763a theres codification note says enacted part death high seas act it pertains personal injury death it time theres maritime jurisdiction thats correct your honor if questions thank you,318.0,548,16,mr harakas under present law victim lingers say year medical expenses lost wages pecuniary losses recoverable converts death high seas act action wrongful death action but pain suffering decedent might lingered several years say recovery now whats situation territorial waters death high seas act presumably doesnt govern so recovery would substantially different depending whether death occurs accident high seas territorial waters but one argue analysis moragne partly based theres hole law high seas universal judgment state legislatures country changed used death act regard survival thing happened there used survival common law state legislatures said therell survival therefore wanted creative court moragne would authority thing regard survival action squarely covered arguably covered one section dohsa so least wed power well moragne course geographically outside scope statute counterargument hear legal category sense survival actions preexisting common law actions injured party outside scope statute they werent addressed except one section talked right well course prohibition pecuniary i mean limitation pecuniary damages doesnt entirely solve problem decedent whose beneficiaries among people entitled sue dohsa they second cousins friends something like lose whatever benefit estate would recovery yes see theres theres survival statute defendant gets scotfree no wrongful death action dohsa i say limited specific category plaintiffs im assuming estate none beneficiaries estate within category oh i understand yes no i agree covers cases cases beneficiary might dependent friend associate kind that person would get nothing whereas survival statute would oh survival statute the estate gets money and whoever participate estate would share recovery yes yes the obvious group grandchildren i mean imagine grandchildren theres accident older people die estate left grandchildren maybe even lingering forth in case nobody could recover right they wouldnt recover anything i mean theres nobody anything case i mean could recover theres dependency theyre older people beneficiaries estate grandchildren theres lawsuit nobody brings lawsuit who could bring one to death person i mean imagine kind awful case want i mean know terrible suffering whatever people linger long time medical bills eat whole estate i mean i could go want point theres money left grandchild going get money lawsuit money nothing so theyre saying fill hole no i right facts is i right assumption am i right assumption circumstance nobody nobody would get there didnt suffer harm see werent left money no right no no youre right harm i assume this court power supplement presumably moragne well even higginbotham said court power so order distinguish youd draw negative assumption enactment death high seas act youd assume congress argue congress didnt want supplemented and reason congress wouldnt wanted supplemented exactly theyre operating environment nobody gets penny so say hey nobody gets penny going give pennies people suggests wouldnt wanted pennies go people if everything changed well maybe congress wasnt crazy awarding noneconomic damages it seems pretty clear thats way felt 1920 what jones act picking fela survival feature act compare state legislation thats recovers now recovered is difference but havent told anything recoverable that doesnt sound like limiting without ceiling may i ask question kind reveal ignorance supposing slipandfall case ocean liner middle atlantic ocean come back sue law governs measure damages generally maritime law and thats judgemade isnt well general description causes action 763a pertains but ocean any time theres maritime thank mr harakas mr minear well hear you,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,331.0,591,12,mr chief justice may please court the united states submits death high seas act provides exclusive remedy case id like explain congress enacted statute response courts decision the harrisburg held general maritime law provide remedy persons die injuries sea congress legislated understanding wake the harrisburg federal statutory regime created would remedies would available death high seas congress considered policy question appropriate remedies light struck felt proper balance here mobil oil v higginbotham offshore logistics v tallentire court supplement statutory wrongful death remedy remedies congress provide we think course would inappropriate clear text legislative history congress considered possibility survival action decided provide one the instructive provision act purposes section 5 that section recognizes plaintiff might die commencing personal injury suit activities high seas the plight injured person begins suit dies final judgment reached provides especially sympathetic case allowing survival remedy even case congress decided wrongful death remedy would available congress could easily that correct yes now congress could easily written section 5 provide survival type remedy made legislative choice provide type remedy think important congress making essentially legislative choice the legislative history confirms yes well i think congress attempting recognized absence section 5 personal representatives would commence new suit theyre allowing yes step right shoes decedent continue action would transformed wrongful death remedy particular class survivors if congress omitted section would faced question well congress intend prevent type cause action i think argument would still quite clear congress i think legislative history would turn circumstance i think would one primary sources it would certainly figure prominently i think even text would quite helpful text written indicate would pecuniary damages would provided seeking different type remedy would available 1920 yes i yes i think court power create but principal thrust position legislative choice question deciding theres survival remedy doesnt put end number questions come there still questions regard survival remedy inure measure damage would reconciled coordinated wrongful death not necessarily at least regard coordination wrongful death remedy survival remedy would still requirement here youre allowing remedies court going to make decisions terms remedies compensable two different causes action might overlap type remedy thats provided i think additional questions would come additional complications now i said i think legislative history makes clear congress making conscious choice the legislative history reports hearings indicate congress aware difference wrongful death action survival action furthermore congress understood statutory remedy would exclusive congress also apparently aware courts decision michigan v vreeland case justice ginsburg alluded earlier court indicated congress legislature could create survival remedy indeed already discussed congress created types survival remedies jones act also federal employers liability act but congress nevertheless made conscious policy decision provide survival remedy i think court followed traditionally english practice meant action maintenance cure seamen also action negligence general negligence passengers no i think probably would caught surprise changed moragne certainly court indicated different view matter but moragne response actions state legislatures i think appropriate court defer actions congress question as i said legislative policy issue congress its understanding house bill 2005 pass house would simply removed aviation claims death high seas act yes wed faced choiceoflaw question relatively easy zicherman court simply looked question death high seas act wed faced warsaw cases determining appropriate body law most likely would state perhaps foreign cause action there action pending senate i dont believe anything passed senate point i believe provisions different house bill now ive said i think court cannot take action case providing survival remedy without overruling least overriding judgment congress made 1920 perhaps judgment changed perhaps thats decision believe congress if questions,66.0,126,6,so personal representative sues beneficiaries named dohsa what say opponents argument least explain provision way saving action otherwise would exist and might barred limitations right may i ask youd decide case congress omitted section 5 dohsa youd rely legislative history yes no opponents seeking kind remedy court created effect moragne everybody seems agree power create remedy think inconsistent congressional direction yes but kind questions get plaintiff doesnt die slipandfall case yes was congress aware time federal courts created new tort remedies admiralty law tortlike remedies what im driving would congress time also aware possibility federal admiralty courts could create remedies no and enlighten give us enlightenment weve already counsel legislative policy what current thinking air crashes left state law moragnetype thank mr minear the case submitted,16,2,408.0,265.0

governmentimposed burdens religious exercise violate establishment clause rather court put point zorach clauson government eases kind burdens follows best traditions the religious land use institutionalized persons act rluipa eases government burdens restrictions institutions prison officials examine burdens religious exercise remove unjustified substantial burdens thats exactly right mr chief justice i think that doesnt make substantial difference part i think think certainly application rluipa spending clause legislation and spending legislation often takes form giving states incentive take action and sense i think understand legislation giving states opportunity remove burdens religious exercise and thats precisely works practice the relevant action state takes state action removing burdens federal action imposed states and i think thats consistent analysis court dole case federal government assumption court didnt direct power 21st amendment raise drinking age could give option states exercise power so i think end burdens removed attributable state ohio federal government it also true standard thats imposed rluipa exacting standard imposed federal constitution but i dont think providing greater accommodation religious exercise federal constitution creates establishment clause problem absolutely mr chief justice i dont think case poses problems city boerne first really isnt effort rewrite rule decision cases way rfra congress legislation targeted two areas particular problems respect religious exercise contexts addressed different standard now i say standard higher standards half states also apply heightened scrutiny test either matter state constitutional law state law that also true i mean there sure well i take point justice scalia i would i would clarify potential applications statute commerce clause we dont think thats really appropriately presented we also think respect state prisons applications spending clause applications thats right justice ginsburg i think fact may one hook legislation certain applications shouldnt make constitutional difference and i think spending clause legislation applies state ohio i think thats conceded they take issue whether valid well justice stevens i dont think fact theres money involved makes harder easier spending clause perspective i think perspective case different boerne fact spending clause commerce clause section 5 legislation makes big difference but i certainly dont want leave impression theres anything constitutionally problematic theres federal money involved course court upheld federal spending clause legislation religion areas cases like zobrest mergens agostini mitchell helms no i dont justice stevens or another way answering i would say even though thought establishment clause problem city boerne case i dont think need find one and part targeted legislation particularly deals as comes court application exercise religion prisons and i think thats area like military government necessarily going involved religion way otherwise wouldnt justice oconnor well justice oconnor i dont think upon analysis i think theres couple reasons thats first absolute entitlement get religious beer 500 pm every day it balancing test i think things like getting beer every day getting marijuana inside prison walls would satisfy test well justice oconnor take step back i mean applying standard smith case thought general law banning marijuana use outside or peyote use outside peyote outside prison would justified even standard i would think fortiori would justified within prison walls i want make another point incentives though i think important every state union provides degree accommodation religion many states majoritarian religions accommodated now theres going incentive engage religiosity prison order take advantage things offered religion arent available something else least rluipa virtue making sure religions accommodated neutrally so theres incentive incentive religion irreligion opposed sects sects religions i think thats way would without rluipa involved the point i want make although may extravagant claims certain religions would seem quite enticing much religious exercise many reported cases involve things i dont think people necessarily lining i mean number lower court cases dealing availability kosher food prison means practical matter generally going get cold food rather hot food and i dont think well justice ginsburg i think cite cases footnote 2 reply brief suggest dealing legitimate concerns using prison religious symbols religious items gang signifier gang identifier cases courts even applying heightened standard rluipa rfra deferred government officials i also think though worth noting federal government bureau prisons dealt concern religious medallions opposed beards would used gang identification gang signification ohio i take takes position medallion could used purposes cant within prison walls the bureau prisons contrast takes position medallion wear inside shirt so cant used prison signification purposes gang identification purposes and i think shows kind reasonable accommodation rluipa rfra applies federal bureau prisons i think case like i mean obviously courts recent decision johnson would suggest that prison officials difficult position i think could accede request and i think complying equal protection clause context would compelling interest statute and i think court widmar vincent example suggested avoiding establishment clause problems sufficient compelling interest i would think equally avoiding equal protection clause violation context would also compelling interest i dont think would least restrictive alternative and i think statute would statutory violation refusing particular accommodation i think show ways administer statute way thats respectful decisions local prison officials also make sure degree sensitivity claims religious exercise well justice oconnor free free exercise clause i mean case course comes court substantiality religious beliefs actually held individuals stipulated thats right justice oconnor thats true free exercise clause well so even sixth circuit obviously problems statute understood score theres entanglement religion rluipa free exercise clause thats right mr chief justice court clear context legislative accommodations religion particular make clear that preference religion irreligion doesnt mean government cannot provide legislative accommodations religion without providing benefits secular organizations well that clear holding court amos and i think although court expressed concerns religious accommodations theres guarantee religious accommodation provided sects take example kiryas joel case this court quite clear constitutional problem favoring religion irreligion providing legislative accommodations religion and i said in zorach clauson court noted thats absence constitutional problem theres really constitutional virtue legislature acting accommodate religion the court made basically point smith saying even though free exercise clause require special accommodation exemption peyote legislatures could so would furthering constitutional values if i could say words spending clause claim brought ohio case they suggest theres difficulty legislation spending clause now court well i think questions presented i dont think i think would fairly open court reach it would alternative ground support judgment that said court doesnt reach practice recent cases theres one constitutional claim court ruled doesnt necessarily reach the constitutional claims the court cases like oakland cannabis pierce county case and would urge course although courts divided establishment clause issue courts divided spending clause issue all courts reached upheld valid spending clause legislation and i think reflects fact clear nexus federal funds federal conditions imposed if federal government going provide money 1 million ohio prisoner meals certainly federal government insist kosher meals among available options and the federal government going provide monies ohio build prisons ensure prisons safe operated consistent federal policy theres discrimination basis race religion the last issue case course commerce clause issue issue court reached issue and think courts recent admonition sabri case facial challenges best infrequent applies particular force no course justice scalia i must misspoke my point raise three arguments alternative arguments support judgment my burden defeat three show court reaches so i show theres establishment clause violation weve certainly made argument brief today theres spending clause violation theres commerce clause violation the case commerce clause claim completely abstract quality indeed temptation reach issue would since rluipa jurisdictional element resolution commerce clause clear might tempting reach but i think better course would court allow issue sorted in lower courts if questions i would reserve time rebuttal mr chief justice rehnquist may please court this case comes court motion dismiss facts underlying facts involving motion dismiss dispute serious dispute and reserved for court particular claims clients religions affiliated gang activities serious disputes there wicca chaplain thats hired department corrections wisconsin two former students upstanding members bar every respect asatrus matters preserved court this court made asked many questions accommodation religion suggestion well isnt favoritism doesnt encourage favoritism one way but answer questions respect current accommodations already provided ohio department corrections respect mainstream religions fact believe remand able show preference accommodating mainstream religions opposed nonmainstream religions similarly there questions court that standard imposed state ohio rluipa particularly difficult tortuous standard in fact state law humphrey v lane cited brief state ohio supreme court already imposed similar standard regard religious accommodation claims prison guards with due respect your honor i understand uncomfortable feeling nature clients religion as court note a footnote brief reported press adherent royal navy satanism royal navy agreed hes killed line duty religious rights end consistent religion fact amounts recognition religion well i laughter the answer yes it nonmainstream religion and i think important us assure religious groups stripes are accommodated in context i believe statute pretty clear compelling requiring state ohio engage unconstitutional activity would segregation races theres compelling justification compelling governmental interest complying statute saying statute apply circumstances to extent bona fide religious literature racist believe constitution permits congress legislative body accommodate religion isolation religious right fundamental rights i believe matter course prison officials determine whether theres good faith request religious accommodation whether person trying seek something ruse thats correct but let finish my answer justice ginsburg if court view members court view would content discrimination example although believe accommodate one fundamental right separately fundamental rights course first amendment violation would compelling governmental interest justifying refusal apply rluipa so serious problem and fact reported case racist literature ever permitted prisons weve able find thats well i say extent thats right content discrimination along lines and court said could courts view could accommodated religion course would compelling governmental interest avoiding content discrimination in terms whether theres compelling justification dealing inflammatory literature i dont think thats dispute case well first well as i read amos amos says accommodation religion need come well im sure different constitutional purposes differential accommodation court concludes violates first amendment rights someone else theres content discrimination im reason treat source accommodation dispositive its whether presence accommodation whether broad enough narrow enough on hand we want make clear numerous accommodations involve first amendment rights overlap with religious exercise accommodation religious exercise to extent political gatherings theyre entitled first amendment theyre accommodated way religious congregations prison accommodated and court far found constitutional violation distinction and extent theres compelling governmental interest little doubt the prison officials simply say this accommodate were required accommodate statute the important note accommodations routinely granted mainstream religions shift burdens third parties theres substantial argument substantial shifting burdens third parties in fact third party claims made state ohio basically cost security increased takes cost prison administration increased takes time take care claims requests accommodation would didnt attend well argument example religious accommodation forces and third parties chip caldor example private third parties that renders accommodation unconstitutional and state arguing lifting burdens religious exercise clients makes harder prison guards,425.0,512,18,well hear argument next no 039877 jon cutter v reginald wilkinson mr clement but know say eases burdens doesnt ease burdens imposed federal government it eases burdens imposed state governments but in city boerne didnt say congress couldnt come simply rewrite part constitution make read differently well rfra didnt involve a limitation situations federal funds involved i understand statute more also i seems principal difference rfra is youre saying academic statute doesnt require federal spending hook it says commerce peg i take you gave pragmatic answer that every state fact gets federal funds prison systems but mr clement seems spending clause aspect cuts direction focusing establishment clause the fact federal money involved make burden less defending the statute establishment clause do think establishment clause issue case would establishment clause issue city boerne court reached establishment clause issue case and yet it provides unusual framework incentive prison context get religion if find religious group espouses drinking beer every day alcoholic beverages taking certain amounts marijuana telling certain clothing things would alter conditions prison environment theres real incentive get religion laughter and federal government seems trying provide incentives is problem well the language statute pretty strong unless government demonstrates imposition least restrictive means furtherance compelling legislative interest it puts quite burden state yes i think what garb said associated religion also used cue gang membership lets say beard this religion requires wear beard what religion genuine tenet religion races separated person says accommodation i want never celled someone race does statute require prison officials evaluate bona fides particular religion thats espoused isnt one groups satanist group so religion bona fides group reviewed prison authorities we dont decide looming and goes back resolved every case havent said least one cases government cant favor religion irreligion is us questions presented i dont i dont understand mr clement second point strengthens first point that say disagree first point namely institutionalized persons provisions consistent establishment clause think contradict establishment clause couldnt possibly saved second point can require a condition spending clause state violate establishment clause thank mr clement mr goldberger well hear is satanism nonmainstream religion what the royal navy say our royal navy laughter to extent i asked the racist religion says god wanted races separated accommodation cell someone another race how racist literature aegis religious organization and suppose prison permit say member aryan nation get racist literature get racist literature well when use term bona fide youre introducing new kind factor do courts evaluate bona fides someone claiming religion i take weve done conscientious objector cases united states v seeger gillette well content discrimination i take would raised someone wants get political psychological reasons would say im challenging right member religious sect i say well i i take underlying justice ginsburgs question is concern accommodation unequal first amendment rights given given precedence that least underlying concern question i think legitimate concern well amos court the government saying one statutes could accommodated this something different im im sorry youve lost i dont know mean shifting burdens third parties what thank mr goldberger mr cole well hear you,1127.0,1985,36,mr chief justice may please court in prisons unique environment rluipa violates constitution it directly impermissibly advances religion would be perceived objective observers endorsement well i think your honor brief came across way i i think overstates line asking court draw the court recognized talking accommodations course accommodations nature benefit religion thats part accommodation could said effect but court said must draw lines that court recognized cant say oh accommodation means thats fine always going fine accommodation in fact justice oconnor said need draw lines otherwise everything become oh thats accommodation the line violated your honor unique incentives burdens arise prison context but in prisons unique environment your honor many deprivations liberty say one one way get thumb prison regulations claim religion thats going give powerful weapon but court has always articulated rules well turner olone court articulated rules different prison citing intractable problems prison administration and problems subjecting no your honor going going back beto case court said free exercise applies prison olone court said applies prison standard going use one thats similar to rational basis were asking bright line rule your honor it could well case providing kosher meals instance whether thats required free exercise clause might go marginally beyond free exercise requires thats accommodation would perfectly legitimate but rule says anytime bring request kind accommodation rule going treated differently better religion well your honor i dont think need go far i i think could look given types accommodations say legislative determination made type accommodation respect type request appropriate based balancing factors consider particular case might slide well narrow targeted i guess point your honor narrow targeted accommodation would different view broad wonder bus approach accommodation no your honor i i dont believe i think instance legislature said you shall absent compelling need provide prisoners diet meets religious requirements would discriminate among religions it would narrowly tailored perceived problem might exist and your honor believe prisons unique environment extent go beyond free exercise clause raises special problems special concerns need dealt case case basis its insufficient your honor doesnt change underlying fact request whatever ultimate outcome request request gets treated differently better merely religion this no your honor im im suggesting and court noted amos type statutes necessarily going single religion doesnt shield establishment clause scrutiny take form directed religion providing benefit thats thats labeled accommodation i mean instance congress could say look think difficult state prisoners practice religious beliefs cant go church so absent compelling state interest least restrictive alternatives prisons need arrange release prisoners week go church synagogue choice well would provide awfully powerful incentive inside prison walls prisoners to claim religion thank your honor that no your honor i think thats important well someone bona fide religion and prison officials challenge whether fact religious set beliefs but religious set beliefs sincere cant challenge particular request mandated religion for religious reasons i would prefer well your honor i wish i could draw brighter line rule your honor its magnitude congress enhanced religious right that compare constitution requires state prison officials say far congress moved ball well argument pinned courts decisions turner olone see establishing baseline type constitution requires terms free exercise prison well use baseline compare standard imposed standard congress seeking impose rluipa compare magnitude two understanding court said lemon lines demarcation difficult perceive its difficult say exactly line i i believe your honor given prisons unique environment i believe turner olone prison cases talk constitution means prison understanding prison need changes would otherwise see inmates constitutional rights prison well your honor i think burdens prison environment twofold first rluipa forces prison officials change balance would otherwise strike safety accommodation changing balance changing margin safety theyre imposing risks inmates prison and arent merely yes your honor and compelling state interest doesnt present problem state ohio states operating statute what presents problem least restrictive alternative part subjects state prison officials daytoday judgments regarding prison operations strict scrutiny analysis back end the least restrictive alternative puts teeth rluipa whats creates problem well united states claims your honor course but look back experience states rfra declared unconstitutional presented substantial evidence in joint appendix regard way explosion demands accommodations prisoners previously unheard religions there expansion explosion claims conversion within thats correct your honor difficulty doesnt seem go away least restrictive alternative test is possibility court noted turner every judgment every day subject court somewhere finding less restrictive way achieving goal and see well thats particularly encouraging your honor laughter yes your honor and i guess i go back compare accommodation thats thats issue that issue amos say employers dont need comply one federal statute one set obligations and i asked well okay employer is going make ibm switch computer manufacturer religious services provider boy we get underneath title viis nondiscrimination mandate i dont think but i look prison i say going effect ground respect people claiming religion converting religion i tell theres going different regulatory regime applies your honor i i dont know hasnt i mean im im surprised sense hear claim brief period rfra apply state prisons explosion demands and i would direct court i believe 204 210 211 212 joint appendix see ways theres impact id also your honor i dont know fact that strict scrutiny might become means thats going require and arguably slightly different strict scrutiny strict scrutinies legislative history extent one one wants look and thats i guess problem as flesh entire time saying right burden inmates prisons its right burden prison officials its right congress burden federal prison officials congress burden state prison officials new set obligations well your honor well im im sure i agree your honor for couple reasons first also purports commerce clause legislation case would mandate upon states whether but secondly your honor respect spending clause issue court said dole needs relatedness spending theres going strings attached actually attached federal money meaningful way and congress relying spending absolutely nothing no your honor thats thats true your honor available court alternate ground affirmance of decision well your honor i dont believe your honor theory isnt anytime go beyond free exercise requires youre immediately establishment clause violation we recognize play joints and providing chaplains given the rich history tradition prisons seems fall comfortably within play joints the question gone far when accommodation slid dissent put texas monthly impermissible incentive practice religion your honor first im sure claim oh treated differently worse their claim want get together congregate religious services mr hamptons case wicca wanted certain objects including quartz crystal would able keep cell they may well your honor and point cases prison officials look object say whats potential harm should let cell theres theres practice ohio prisons thats right your honor absolutely your honor absolutely theres a request prisoner wants grooming regulations changed respect hes prisoner whos got history contraband violations hes involved a prison betting pool carries tries carry betting slips secret person and could violate grooming regulations concern might use hide contraband there prisoners want wear hair certain way signify gang affiliation instead claim well i need religious purposes whats really going want signify gang affiliation your honor im im sure theres compelling interest the question least restrictive alternative are going able meet every federal judges view least restrictive way could go achieving compelling interest theres doubt prison security going recognized compelling state interest difficulty least restrictive alternative test frankly your honor rfra time congress gone far and say theres lack case law suggest theres settled understandings cant go far rather in brief we looked lee v weisman court called subtle indirect coercion religion merely standing a invocation graduation year and contrast whats going constant pressure day day want set benefits get religion thats correct your honor again your honor couldnt potentially win cases least restrictive alternative the question changing standard changing standard one prison officials i mean congress sense asking federal judges sit overseers religious life prisons across 50 states and given court said turner given court said olone intractable problems prison officials face seems inappropriate task one motivated desire increasing religiosity prison seems cross establishment right except your honor court noted turner i believe need judicial deference particularly strong youre dealing situations create ripple effects prison and difficult federal judges know they dont prison management experience they dont 20 years ground like prison wardens say this accommodation work one wont if face statute your honor i mean face statute it says compelling state interest least restrictive alternative i would like note well i believe mr clement noted that case held okay cant wear medallion outside shirt wear inside shirt so would less restrictive alternative allowing use medallion i guess gang identifier now doesnt really deal problem soon guard looking pulled outside shirt used gang identifier maybe your honor but question is permissible congress create incentives prisoners say yes im religious i want benefits can congress really say boy wed like religious way going provide incentive giving better shot getting rules prison its guaranteed shot getting better shot getting rules apply everybody else prison get become religious better shot well your honor i careful i say much better shot i mean point i i think comparing whats gone in fact court adopted version approach already in caldor court said unqualified imposes burden others thats going violate establishment clause i see time your honor thank thank mr chief justice just points rebuttal first id like note anomaly much argument general cole would argument state constitutional provision gives higher protection freedom conscience ohio unconstitutional id happy justice oconnor i think theres exaggeration far goes beyond now i want clear one thing court even smith olone said going deference prison officials turner standard would apply so extent theres little less deference olone standard modification the centrality requirement though something charged rluipa rfra even smith case court ling hernandez moving away centrality well justice scalia justice scalia i dont think court ever accommodations cases held government accommodate things central i dont know sure i rather doubt employing coreligionists gymnasium central practice faith yet amos court upheld valid accommodation and i think centrality requirement whats i may mr chief justice but but extent i i think questions best kept courts even smith court moved away centrality its even justice oconnor otherwise disagreement smith also agreed get rid centrality requirement and look cases actually decided rluipa cases involve things like muslim prayer oil cases seventh circuit example allows now dont want courts getting well i i think thats right i think centrality requirement accommodations i want make point though that ohio already state constitution heightened review lot know least restrictive alternative tests like nobody thinks ohios constitution violates federal constitution thats true even though ohio applies prison context least claim guard rather inmate that facts humphrey lane its also true many ohios arguments would suggest accommodations religions give much incentive religious exercise like and i think thats defect well i dont think i agree justice souter regard narrower accommodations actually raise constitutional problems broader accommodations i think court example caldor dealt accommodation fairly high level generality yet court said justice oconnor emphasized concurrence well thats preference sabbatarian religions and i think avoid kind acrosstheboard test justice kennedy made point whether extreme degree accommodates religion certainly extreme the laws constitutions 26 states across board apply heightened scrutiny manner state actions so sense fact accommodates religion kind wholesale broader standard opposed retail i dont think constitutional defect the last point i wanted make racist literature hypothetical i think large measure hypothetical as footnote 2 brief points prisons generally successful keeping racist literature even supported claim religiousbased racist literature the cases ive come across hasnt prevailed the prisons policy exceptions made little sense and case example look joint appendix page 118 theres allegation with one piece literature described racist prisoners allowed others allowed kind literature now i dont know whether claims fact true thats kind claim able go forward case like with respect i think sixth circuit made mistake ignored courts precedents reversed,947.0,1458,43,let ask this question it i think goes the heart i think problem case if going recognize sphere accommodation done previously i think recognize the object accommodating effect accommodating one sense benefit i mean obvious sense benefit religion by recognizing sphere accommodation effect i think court said sphere religion benefitted rise necessarily level government proselytization or government endorsement and seems argument youre making government endorses immediately in the realm establishment am i i missing something argument all right and line violated well statute appears try go back preemployment division v smith case standard free exercise clause allow accommodation religion and appears statute designed but employment division v smith wouldnt question arise prison context would dealt thenstandards but court ever said free exercise clause couldnt applied prison context okay then i think youre saying order exceed free exercise requires prison necessarily forces establishment and i think youre saying reason so many incentives part prisoners claim religion thats way sort keep genie bottle isnt the essence argument well but rule says number one as brother side pointed theres got determination made threshold matter whether even religious claim or whether gaming system so theres nothing automatic number two as frequently prison context important governmental interests served denying the request request denied and seems sufficient recognitions the prison context i dont know kind rule would satisfy except say isnt absolutely required free exercise establishment you you mean specific accommodations like kosher foods wear religious medal tatoo i mean youre youre asking legislature specific it would also rather discriminatory one wouldnt i mean one one point got concerned whether dealing accommodation whether dealing with flatout establishment distinction among religions and i think youre saying distinguish among religions dont problem i think lands frying pan fire a guy comes along different religion says omnivorous got got wear medals no statute says medals okay it know i realize level generality example higher the discrimination quite blatant pretty tough job come would tough job come statutes without picking choosing among religious demands why cant but cant dealt statute written saying if bona fide request prison determine fact you compelling state interest cannot served way say why insufficient and therefore reason that jumps us establishment clause violation every time well saying that statute unconstitutional recognize prisoners right free exercise unless also a kind litany sections recognizing speech rights recognizing privacy rights et cetera then got single religion sure would so maybe thats and statute would clearly reason saying mr cole sure statute doesnt go beyond presmith presmith law im aware presmith law would defined religious exercise broadly statute defines i guess something mr clement ought speak well it says term religious exercise includes exercise religion whether compelled central system religious belief did prior smith cases go far im aware they dont even say my religion requires eat food they say know im yes what argument response justice souter you said following it state list along religious matters second amendment first amendment et cetera its you seem say argument person files piece paper claims religious consider impelled religion i suppose thing true church applies tax exemption so i dont think could say automatically fact theyre going give church tax exemption theyre going give religious person special consideration that violates establishment clause very well what no but i need know youre going generally i dont need bright line rule im trying find violates clause isnt first thing second thing i mentioned fine now respect two points one justice oconnors i think congress enlarging second qualification beyond would smith never decided and second justice scalias point one respect congress enlarge namely right doesnt belief doesnt central it could well read so whole argument pinned latter point and youre saying turner come prior smith court would said turner trumps presmith law dont follow presmith law prison i understand now i i understand argument helpful very well from prisons point view burdensome since would thought security compelling interest prison administration compelling interest really think look see whether isnt reasonable way accommodating request i think i think may exaggerate takes establish compelling state interest i mean this court held in presmith days compelling state interest to prevent members air force wearing yarmulkes i mean thats compelling state interest i think pretty easy get anything declared a compelling state interest statute dont think and goes beyond presmith doesnt least restrictive alternative we experience federal system standards apply rfra and positing terrible disturbance prison administration 6 years that rfra force federal prisons have there terrible disruption have accommodations required much prison administrators yes gotten sorted experience bureau prisons federal side one would expect would less farout claims the would expect statute new might claims would recognize frivolous theres experience this true now youre dilemma i mean youre putting position virtually every official in united states judges who worry court appeals but anyway the laughter you see answer argument case youre vice they put a kind pincers good argument say well doesnt violate statute claim weak say well shouldnt violate statute and difficulty pincers like cant win and virtue shouldnt win all right so get kind argument no point then hasnt effect federal ground ill ill grant seems i mean justice ginsburg responded saying things get sorted at beginning get sorts loony claims as time goes get fewer and if werent getting i would expected united states make different representation well i dont know thats got know may may argument i dont know got meaning establishment clause and theyre burdening anyway anyway just dont take money it comes money you dont want burden dont take money i mean they time what us case is case covered the spending clause so dont grapple commerce clause but sixth circuit didnt pass spending spending clause issue and isnt raised opponents petition yes looking there one question brought ohios practice but you say obligation relieve burdens if we would violate establishment clause the point made ohio pays chaplains doesnt pay say psychologists come agnostics so arent right violating establishment clause theory may i ask question mr cole i troubled also point least restrictive language statute but i try apply particular case werent allegations petitioners made treated differently mainstream religions accommodation would well treat would least restrictive alternative it wouldnt created problems describe and say dont cant group meetings they treated exactly would that would satisfy least restrictive alternative part statute wouldnt and would burden dont mainstream religion adherents certain objects theyd like keep cell the mainstream person theres potential harm wouldnt let keep in cell would and words really although language statute seems go farther anything really stake beyond saying treat us treat mainstream members mainstream religions and best example if want us say it would seem would compelling interest say cant well i i suppose youre saying want us make holding one holdings youd satisfied accommodation is appropriate extreme accommodation whats best case i i cant remember case weve tried ask whether every form request accommodation acknowledged is case youve come across well i guess im asking whats closest analogy what american indian didnt i think american indian but didnt want known woman didnt want known number she wanted name that religious basis and social security i think court hold didnt give so stood proposition administrative considerations play important role deciding whether youve hit upon least restrictive alternative and long law youre okay and supreme court case i think i may misremembering youre asking us why it worse for judges overseers religious life prison wardens overseers religious life prison i mean somebody say lines what accommodated wont and someone going government official i reason believe wardens are better judges except respect know security administrative convenience honor statute and i think means give great deference what wardens prisons say compelling interest of penal system can give example because things i think either kosher food cannot either wear yarmulke youre theres another alternative most things yes what case well cant well give something lesser well maybe warden says court would say fine dont accommodate better shot better shot better shot the free exercise clause alone would allow and arent arguing prison context get beyond free exercise line establishment okay but administer how anyone administer that kind test it better much better it thank mr cole mr clement 4 minutes remaining why dont address ways act goes beyond former free exercise also compelled compelled religion you say know i i want give everything except candy lent the prison accommodate right its compelled i know i could something else but i thought prior religion cases did indeed require religious compulsion i know id like religious matter lds i said may underestimate lds laughter i guess youre right i think i thinking free exercise cases rather establishment cases thank mr clement the case

protected first amendment and speech falsely proposes unlawful transaction likewise unprotected the statute issue properly construed prohibit efforts offer solicit materials contraband prevents somebody turning around soliciting offering contraband suggesting materials either exist contraband the statute prohibit truthful speech lawful materials accordingly court appeals erred striking statute face mr chief justice think would covered statute we dont think that would involve first point dont think would involve presentation promotion movie meaning statute we think terms really limited efforts make product available market and i think read terms conjunction directed efforts make product available market now person whose actually distributing film wants try market actual child pornography i suppose would come within ambit statute but movie reviewer anything worry first instance i dont think would come within term again justice kennedy might conceptually possible somebody market lets say mainstream movie basis either statement attached review misrepresents nature movie makes claim movie actual child pornography i suppose unusual circumstance would covered but i guess would equally possible somebody take one countless mainstream movies portrays murder screen say actually snuff film theres actually snuff film this actual murder now somebody would clearly misrepresenting film i dont think would turn around somebody tried something false misleading speech able defend speech would clearly false misleading speech and i think important underlying movie child pornography truthful efforts promote movie wont captured if movie comes within and done sufficiently graphic way captured well justice stevens theres i guess theres anterior problem depiction sufficiently graphic the person would film would possession child pornography would problem statute hes possession and might example starting basic prohibition possession child pornography might situation valid asapplied challenge and also might situation would valid asapplied challenge pandering solicitation provision but i think proper way analyze ask first whether something covered basic prohibition i agree i think theory least may valid asapplied challenges underlying prohibition and court course ferber recognized possibility upholding basic prohibition promotion child pornography context it justice ginsburg i think context would something comes within ambit statute and start proposition i understand justice ginsburg what i would say statute order apply least way interpret requires objective subjective component and would situation promotion movie objectively would lead somebody believe youre marketing manner portrays actual child pornography now i think youve said right would probably fail objective test i think particularly start talking motion picture like natural assumption lets say mainstream motion picture going oh thats actors probably adult actors body double something i dont think comes within statute the thing thats required course subjective component specific intent way would read statute and clearly person whos marketing lolita wants people go see mainstream box office intent convey people actual forbidden child pornography justice souter i would say better answer now justice souter i would say fundamental reason i think read two provisions statute pari materia and provision i think relevant affirmative defense thats subsection statute 6a appendix opening gray brief and provides affirmative defense situation somebody possession child pornography now first problem person gets child pornography mail statute bans possession would apply now theres affirmative defense the affirmative defense specific possession one things thats prerequisite qualify affirmative defense d2b afford material afford agency law enforcement agency access material now youre right justice souter problem prohibition possession unique problem pandering solicitation provision and i dont think fact might situation might actually present affirmative defense case reason strike ban possession overbroad but well justice souter let try two responses one i think problem even possession get mail possession knowing and precisely congress included affirmative defense statute the second thing i would say though read statutes pari materia one ways qualify affirmative defense afford access law enforcement agency material i dont think prerequisite qualifying affirmative defense independently prohibited statute well i think i dont know would necessarily covered statute said i got disgusting child pornography mail clearly unlawful take look i mean i suppose covered statute but doesnt seem like natural reaction justice breyer i think would take position even presenting material making available youre charging youre exchanging youre offering free heres quick free look still covered statute well justice breyer i mean know i think could certainly interpret statute write around problem wanted i think natural reading terms promotes distributes presents advertises  capture somebody making available market sale barter also somebody says look i child pornography i want get interested this real stuff take look well mr chief justice i mean i think first cut drawing line would say problem say believe i got mail talk neighbor describe on hand i think youre presenting materials say i got mail look isnt disgusting clearly child pornography if think though well justice breyer think thats difference expanding statute enormous way i would invite restrictive view presents and certainly want interpret statute way renders overbroad and course court made clear number occasions get overbreadth analysis applying early constructions make sure statute possible construed constitutional but i could im sorry well justice ginsburg i think may distinction drawn we certainly dont think limited commercial speech commercial speech mean efforts buy sell even efforts barter because think somebody sort systematically operating web site giving away child pornography advertising would clearly covered statute so extent distinction commercial noncommercial line would say youre giving away gratis think thats still covered now i gather maybe justice breyer different conception mind really well fairness mr chief justice i think slightly broader conception presents what thinking presents means really sort know abstract way talking presenting material youre actually furnishing material somebody else and not justice alito i think thats important point respect justice breyers hypothetical i mean remember materials talking main materials unlawful even possess and also true wake ferber pretty good job done getting materials real world so kind pictures infrequently occurs especially real world say pictures magazines handed around adolescent adolescent really reason world suspect whats handed adolescent adolescent child pornography opposed adult pornography playboy sort thing because truth matter wake ferber pretty good job done stamping child pornography real world it moved unfortunately internet and context people promoting actual child pornography soliciting actual child pornography it justice stevens basic prohibition and i think whats important may definitional know questions or may view applications statute would unconstitutional but whats important i think pandering solicitation provision doesnt add new definition aggressive definition it simply picks notion basic definition child pornography says youre taking materials offering market actual child pornography soliciting actual child pornography government go direct acts solicitation offering and prosecute acts without thats right justice ginsburg if scienter requirements satisfied im consciously trying get believe even though i something technical reason real thing im offering real thing statute target but seems to first amendment problem it seems natural consequence congress taking courts advice free speech coalition moving prohibition materials pandered actual acts pandering solicitation well justice kennedy think hypotheticals taken one reason i mean i think catholic bishops sure oh but real minors engaging forbidden activity actual child pornography well underlying material actually child pornography may different situation all hypotheticals brief materials underlying materials child pornography and i think thats important distinction youre taking movie like traffic american beauty child pornography youre simply truthfully promoting nothing worry statute now took something i also think catholic bishop situation isnt covered promoting presenting distributing well i mean i mean hand held video video child pornography got internet otherwise decided wanted promote i mean would covered statute but here i would try analyze justice kennedy i would say would asapplied challenge basic prohibition child pornography would apply underlying materials would asapplied exception and therefore pandering solicitation would equally outside constitutional i mean would another way try get right well might way statute could cover it would follows basically im going portray material im going portray way makes clear i valid asapplied challenge im sure i would satisfying objective subjective scienter requirements statute because would clear although i presenting visual depictions children happen i presenting exclusively scientific artistic literary value and therefore sense i building asapplied challenge way i marketing i think could well justice scalia thats exactly right and thats i would think logical way proceed would would find asapplied exception basic prohibition and naturally would apply pandering provision i sort suggesting pressed ways might actually easier find way get outside statute respect pandering solicitation provision possession no correct justice souter and i would say that hypothetical outside ambit statute two reasons first i dont think movie reviewer promoting presenting underlying materials they would reason i also think would started applying objective subjective requirements statute would find either satisfied respect if i know youre talking mainstream movie say depicts sex minor im going naturally think comes within ambit statute actual child pornography within meaning statute with respect justice souter thats i think important objective subjective requirement and i think objective requirement alone would take if i could reserve remainder no i wouldnt think i think would use reasonable person thats exactly thats i that would fine justice souter and i would submit even 17 year old nonlaw student would know movies depict things dont actually happen when see murder screen thats actually murder and i think would understand thats movie its child pornography if i may reserve remainder time traffic child pornography i understand actress 17 time film dont think comes within ambit basic prohibition child pornography think simulated sexual activity interpreted enough subtlety doesnt capture and thats position it but statute ferber and dont think introduced overbreadth vagueness fatal this statute picks definition it doesnt add if i may reserve thank mr chief justice overbreadth court reminded us number times strong medicine even first amendment context asapplied challenges remain basic building blocks adjudication rejection overbreadth challenge mean courts open asapplied challenges going forward of course respondent claim statute unconstitutional applied well i think could justice kennedy you could i mean burden challenger doesnt say statutes unconstitutional asapplied to show substantial overbreadth absolute terms relative statutes legitimate sweep and interesting neither respondent court appeals ever engaged latter inquiry and thats critical inquiry justice ginsburg im urging get rid overbreadth doctrine probably governments interest i simply saying apply overbreadth analyses way supposed applied satisfied its enough envision couple hypotheticals it overbreadth substantial relative legitimate sweep statute this court virginia hicks said faulted lower court opinion analyses whatsoever valid versus invalid applications the proportionality aspect courts overbreadth jurisprudence ignored entirely that could verbatim holding case the 11 circuit engage relative analysis when brother asked empirical evidence comparison said didnt with due respect i think thats fatal case i think way i would explain i didnt think get found absolute overbreadth didnt even reach proportionality inquiry in invent hicks decided afterwards i think hicks makes clear absolute relative i would say one last thing though this first foremost start facts case facts case i think caution reading word presents statute reading unduly narrowly the gravamen pandering offer pictures individual daughter claim i post actual images child pornography group site im real im undercover agent now seems within epicenter statute profit it establish bona fide thank you,774.0,1079,25,well hear argument first morning case 06694 united states v williams general clement but i could start one compelling hypotheticals side lets say im movie reviewer i write review saying awful movie it portrays child pornography arent i presenting information way would cause others believe movie contains child pornography wouldnt covered statute suppose distributor attaches movie review its amazondotcom movie review supposing underlying movie depiction atrocities committed foreign country war zone something soldiers rape young kids and comes within literal terms statute and one said id like take look movie wouldnt covered statute the movie would pictures soldiers raping young kids if news im thinking news reel somebody makes exhibit war crimes trial something like sees actually happening now i understand language statute person film described someone wanted send would violate statute they depiction war crime taking place he saw camera would crime you agree i guess there would valid asapplied challenges statute but ferber confined meaning child pornography i think greater extent statute it talks artistic value several examples given briefs one film depicts 12 year old child sexual relations old man now statement could perceived film shows child pornography just statement but truthful statement lolita why if say say 12 year old child film shows 12 year old child doesnt tell person whos playing 12 year old young adult well individual received actual child pornography mail solicited and calls chief police town says i opened mail envelope full child porn and hes right i mean body doubles this real thing he presented child pornography chief police hes violated statute hasnt you say say wont enforce way but the objective component subjective component example satisfied thats thats fine get point theres still indictable offense you dont prevent dont present affirmative defenses youre already indicted but ban possession real problem normal possession statute would indeed problem merely terms could raised merely affirmative defense element statute if possession merely matter happenstance theres intent problem presumably theres theres offense theres knowing offense acquiring material possession but pandering statute weve got put earlier understanding happens correct objectively correct child porn clear intent convey message way presenting material third party case police so i think merely comparable problem haphazard possession what what call neighbor say god i got disgusting child porn mail indeed covered statute i read brief saying statute applies instances either youre trying sell trade that youre trying seems different matter covering covering well instances somebodys simply showing someone else show got mail well id appreciate clarity if thats covered statute youre going suddenly criminalize could awful lot activity goes schools place somebody think funny maybe isnt funny think kind schoolboy behavior theyre showing stuff around totally certain suddenly become federal crime seems like quite extension and i thought youd written way problem i think havent well thats different thing i read brief way justice breyer particularly footnote 4 reply brief i understood giving presents example statute promotional meaning light words around advertises promotes simply telling know neighbor i got i isnt promotional it may technical term presents promotional and i understood brief suggest interpret words advertising soliciting sense all right then take take i would say looking presenting schoolmates dirty pictures fairly common adolescent postadolescent activity and i would suspect highlevel percentage class people dont examine carefully age individuals depicted many might misrepresent age so sounds like statute enormous reach whereas previously i thought hadnt but i wanted clarify footnote chief referred footnote 4 reply brief it says contrary governments brief expressly acknowledges statutes proscription encompasses noncommercial speech so i think justice breyers suggestion said brief statute limited commercial speech something say thats say encompasses noncommercial speech my understanding limited commercial speech that clear footnote i cited but presents limited promotional activity its one thing present say either whether law enforcement neighbor another thing promote child pornography and i thought brief adopting limited construction words like presents would cover promotional activity well general clement is anything suggest hypotheticals people get child pornography unsolicited mail kids school showing dirty pictures actual child pornography situations occur frequency real world im sorry i lost answer i lost negative something are saying type activity frequently occurs infrequently occurs the universe child pornography includes activities 17year olds even though even though fact showing presenting fit definition even youre showing say i got hot child porn it is adult pretending child virtual image so the problem accurate representation hardcore porn saying i got real stuff present real stuff and answer hypotheticals put forth coalition free speech catholic bishops advertisement amazondotcom netflix lets pardon lets assume moment minors content aspect film that real minors things yes yes right if one hand held video school something like there two things that us work one scienter component is overly broad vague forth the content and concern indicated justice stevens outset there terrible practices childtrafficking area children held brothels debased acts there abuses prisons abuses schools if videotapes showing things seems statute theyre clearly covered statute maybe even killing little girl public might sadistic assume thats covered statute is anything presents promotes language scienter component statute gives protection materials is asapplied is so want public see show bad permitted statute presenting i agree different motives but im sure statute covers of course problem presenting pandering you problem mere possession you find exception anyway you find asapplied challenge exception mere possession even dont pander but would case mentioned actual child porn shown truthful honest statement nothing worry but movie reviewer reviewing latest rerelease something lolita film says depicts sexual activity minor that statement true it would taken naive people saying boy shows real thing that truthful statement and yet would still fall within prohibition statute as i understand position way statement would truthful way would excuse would reviewer said depicts sexual activity minor course actor wasnt really minor isnt correct what 17 years old havent gone law school havent read cases you may well assume do use seven year old objective requirement we would use reasonable adult i thought wouldnt use wouldnt use reasonable personal sort goes movies i would suppose 17 year old nonlawschool graduate would within ambit reasonable class you could one question you mentioned film 17 year old playing part but said wouldnt wouldnt fit but statute says simulated thank mr clement mr diaz can reject overbreadth challenge still leave overbreadth doctrine cases im sure could how different would strange trust document doctrine i i understand relied predecessor statute how occur free speech coalition thank general case submitted,784.0,1170,14,mr chief justice may please court the pandering provision protect act carries 5year mandatory minimum prison term possible 20year prison term affirmative defense provision it unconstitutionally vague overbroad face captures protected speech materials and captures speech materials may even fact exist the language manner reflects belief intended cause another believe  sufficiently define prohibited conduct giving law enforcement unfettered discretion subjectively enforce statute in essence eleventh circuit held determination rest materials contain rather someone conveys impression materials convey in words statute short punishes thought beliefs expressions opinions yes mr chief justice and one problems statute another example weve talking amazondotcom netflix theres also example series photography weve seen nationwide famous photographers minors children photographers child modeling agencies if correct the problem i take anything cnn video actual sexually explicit conduct involving minor i take films i start internet blog say look film contains sexual conduct minor i think something i think form coalition i think boycott and i conveying belief i intending make believe materials contain albeit really really illegal yes sir i think would protected if material substantively violates statute mere possession illegal and defense possession part statute presenting police within certain amount time within certain manner conduct what talking possession materials were talking expression materials contain even youre wrong even youre mistaken even youre lying even youre bragging traditional prankster senator leahy said congressional report one things concerned statute could capture people expressing salacious thoughts one problems issue social value lying dont put people jail 5 mandatory minimum years 20 years prison simply lying we simply dont i agree your honor and i agree your honor justice scalia slew state statutes particularly area consumer fraud if i pretend something thats illegal offer promote advertise i nothing person punished statute we necessarily want protect but dont punish 5 20year prison sentence it degree penalty the statute doesnt cover liars justice scalia it also covers people mistaken it covers exaggeration it covers puffing for example i legitimate clean videotape i want duplicate i may violating trademark patent laws whatnot i want take i want sell marketplace internet and i exaggerate words i choose use promoting tape commercial purpose example im exaggerating that person market materials way causes potential buyers believe illegal even im puffing bragging car salesman car sales situation dont like i think could real world i think easy person puff materials contain lawful possess titanic lolita american beauty and would say put trailer say hot graphic teen sex youre puffing really we know know really isnt mr chief justice i think person listens hears somebody describe titanic lolita american beauty films like hot graphic teen sex i think reasonable ordinary person could believe portrayed proscribed material even doesnt exist even exists protected ferber no justice scalia i dont think i think statute covers people brag people puff people tell truth but problem statute capture pandering illegal conduct goes beyond captures slew innocent conduct discussed morning examples the best realistic example would person necessarily amazondotcom netflix could private citizen it could religious leader religious group regardless type religion talking it could people who look the nan goldin pictures look lolita traffic movies harbor belief obscene one two types materials thats proscribed my opinion justice breyer could done we could put dozen two dozen three dozen exponential number examples would excluded essentially would writing affirmative defense statute absolute defense would prohibit even prosecution the concern that raises answer your honors question youre still going chilling free speech there still going people covered one examples havent thought person going afraid express opinions the court certainly justice kennedy essentially though i think court would would taking four areas speech taken first amendment protection defamation fighting words brandenburg miller obscenity additional extension ferber now would carving yet another area speech first amendment going continue chipping away chipping away that certainly could done mr chief justice again i suggested earlier problem talking anything less criminal statute criminal statute implicates first amendment freedom thought court since existence said honor respect even people thinking nasty dirty things thats country based upon grave concern going asapplied challenge people might afraid express views whether is obscene its parent neighborhood group see movie wants tell everybody say look i believe that would narrowly tailor statute i dont believe justice alito would solve problem chilling speech that could would depend i agree your honor justice souter world universe overbroad speech appendix would shrink make narrower with respect initial response justice breyers suggestion your honor justice ginsburg i dont know creating appendix examples going cure problem i concede would lessen problem we would would in answer your honors question comment laughter i agree issue overbreadth something looking boundaries and thats really i think court situation overbreadth analysis you look boundaries how much far weve gone outside boundaries protected the problem dont empirical answer mathematic answer question what know films like lolita american beauty whatnot presented certain way bring people coverage statute received acclaim around world i mean sorts academy awards theyre seen time time theyre seen netflix theyre seen cable tv to day movies around 30 years my response justice breyer take word present give meaning given ferber make statute narrower you make bring constitutionally acceptable realm i respectfully believe cures entire problem basis saying question justice souter solicitor general you know concern dont lawyers understand hypertechnical meanings court going give interpretations going put i think would concededly lesser degree make clear matters covered statute makes easier people conform conduct words accordingly the concern i still chills still chills free speech if person looks appendix looks rationale courts opinion case certainly i go back question justice breyer adolescents 17 year olds 18 year olds like look types materials one could simply say another internet know think get hardcore child porn hes soliciting child porn another person individual 17 year old kid whos fantasizing experimenting sexuality go jail 5 20 years and see everyday america high schools around country if hes soliciting materials sub sub ii statute pandering provision statute yes that person prohibited excuse person prosecuted your honor i cannot cite specific example i certainly tell your honor prosecutions 1997 2004 increased 452 percent the conviction rate exactly and conviction rate 996 percent and can get can get first may protected first amendment shouldnt captured statute puts 17 year old jail 5 20 years i dont think necessarily covered first amendment i think certainly first amendment court held protect salacious thoughts salacious ideas i think first amendment implied i dont think becomes criminal conduct get either attempt solicitation conspiracy you say i would like get get guilty statute right to fall within protection first amendment and another example comes mind person material believe child pornography they give somebody else lolita opinion present person one biggest problems one biggest verb thats objectionable statute present commercial requirement solicitation crime talking expressing desire obtain doesnt quite go level solicitation intent proximity time immediacy certain geographical proximity words comment intend well theres solicit theres also present it works directions correct i agree thank your honor,949.0,1258,46,well theres difference isnt beliefs thoughts legality particular type pornography something like factual matter i thought child pornography saying regulates thoughts beliefs two quite different questions arent but none i mean weve gone solicitor general he went every example brief youve able produce said arent caught statute whats wrong said why isnt photographers example thats child pornography and would act child pornography ferber isnt protected if isnt child pornography ferber well theres problem okay thats view photographers and amazon netflix problem ferber said same problem so whats response said it possession you possess materials what trying take police stop under ferber protected if protected i think would then ferber hes going go right jail i would think would protected i cant imagine somebody collects sites molesting children material prevent children molested presents proper authority going prosecuted new york statute ferber or good honest liars right i thought purpose first amendment protect speech value reason obscenity excluded entirely first amendment protection redeeming social value what social value find able lie content youre offering somebody else you say somehow youre lying oh well first amendment protects i would think youre lying it clearer ever first amendment doesnt protect there social value protecting lies but depends theyre lying if theyre lying value theyre selling know fraud tell social value protecting protecting lie whether thing really isnt child pornography what would want protect are complaining degree penalty but thats entirely different thing say car great car turns great car say either is child pornography fact those two different things the statute objective component to objective observer must reasonably cause believe actually child pornography so that would would prevent sort vague puffery youre talking covered still covering something satisfies subjective objective test you seem think punishing lying i dont read statute punishing lying youd punished even true what punished pandering you one thats bringing lying example you say goodness even pandering lie pandering pandering and i dont see special protection pandering addition pandering youre lying maybe ought get extra penalty laughter but fact statute provide extra penalty it provides penalty pandering and i dont know good defense to say oh i actually lying i mean what present the word pandering used statute it uses lot words promote advertise well maybe thats redundant i guess would governments position present distribute else all verbs become pandering attached explicit sexual material when promote explicit sex pandering i mean word pandering sexual connotation i i think i thought accepted statute thats directed pandering what would say best realistic example provide show overbroad doing suppose what would think opinion says following we take every one examples ones listed put appendix a opinion says solicitor generals interpretation statute amended say word presentment comes promotion infer think interpretation statute none things anything like could prosecuted and understood find example least none present ferber would overbroad therefore constitutional im saying view i saying simply i want know opinion would wrong opinion well i suppose going would simpler maybe prudent us reexamine overbreadth rule your client falls within none examples he convicted everyone recognizes child pornography involving small child and knew and conveyed belief given fact would appear child pornography growing problem serious problem internet maybe examine overbreadth rule say client cannot make challenge no i dont think responsive justice kennedys point you wouldnt carving first amendment you would saying going treat area like areas would say whoever challenging show theyre problematic case in words client relying didnt produce lolita youre relying effect people overbreadth doctrine allows theres substantial amount speech thats protected and i understood question suggest would wait basically asapplied challenges lolita prosecuted would hear case here we one statute covers advertising promoting presenting distributing soliciting suppose activities lumped together one statute separate provision suppose court conclude problem one lets say promotes presents would others fall well overbreadth doctrine set separate statutory provisions no isnt problem problem answer justice breyers hypothetical he said know appendix list i forget said three dozen examples solicitor general says wouldnt covered sounds fine us your answer well would still examples covered but isnt isnt answer that would conceivable overbreadth i suppose matter appendix said somewhere there would example covered would basis asapplied challenge wouldnt substantial overbreadth and isnt case that justice breyers hypo fact decision case wouldnt fair argument substantial overbreadth left statute isnt and rewrite essentially rewriting law thats question technique justice breyer proposed this court generally business writing appendices say well statute couldnt apply situation couldnt apply long put contours around certainly court could write opinion would inform congress particular statute written overbroad explain kind statute wouldnt overbroad but court i think that i dont know instance provided kind appendix said things like traffic theyre okay things like something else okay i dont know why would lessen i assume whatever put appendix saying situations us covered isnt blatant dictum but course bound later cases dicta but come think i guess whole doctrine overbreadth rests upon dictum doesnt it rests upon determination case involves somebody undoubtedly selling child porn horrible kind child porn say case oh we contemplate cases would hold person guilty that dictum isnt so i guess whole doctrine is based dictum so may well put appendix lets put dictum appendix i agree well boundary what protected relation whats unprotected so whats ratio legitimate films like lolita illegitimate child pornography in words fact protected material substantial relation laws legitimate sweep of course point the point appendix unfortunately failing many charming metaphors acquired life laughter it distracts question but i read solicitor generals interpretation statute amended taking word presentment context ferber part definition promotion i thought appendix at least thats hypothetical question and whether like appendices dont like appendices could focus isnt appendix im talking hes filled qualifications using words knowingly reasonable context purely commercial i understood least commercial plus things bartering that really question youve come back american beauty forth theres one thing i think definition keeps discussion american beauty traffic i dont see interpretation anyone could conceivably prosecuted even hes talking group never seen movie that isnt reasonable group people so response said but isnt answer may still overbreadth left substantial most 17 year olds fact going realize real thing going know lolita movie and accept factual proposition solicitor generals answer also accept way appendix way rationale opinion various activities got given essentially commercial quasicommercial character dont pick conversations neighbor thats simply matter statutory interpretation could part rationale if accept factual proposition reasonable viewers likely know engage kind interpretation following solicitor generals view serial list activities construed dont eliminate possibility wouldnt eliminate possibility substantial overbreadth some things may get there may still legitimate applied challenges substantial overbreadth would left it can give example class activities would effect insulated indictment two steps opinion would substantial character do see getting prosecuted state i asked cases a lot states pandering laws case posit case occurred states maybe thats quantity material increased and one person says another get child pornography solicitation oh get and think thats protected first amendment asking someone child pornography protected the thing limits statute first amendment what else say may covered first amendment what else gives right challenge statute but thought point its request obtain contraband fuels production contraband is protected first amendment soliciting child pornography to fall fall statute protected first amendment protected first amendment which i mean model penal code general prohibition soliciting illegal activities are saying thats provision violates first amendment because words but i thought word statute solicit if youre asking somebody child pornography youre presenting child pornography thank mr diaz general clement three minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-21,15,272.0,-175.0

county jail facility media gives public the purpose access case gather information the district court case required certain access given media there requirement similar access given public determination district court public access inadequate way the required media access i say greater sheriff gives public i would like discuss briefly court public access first mail access mail censorship letters read they subject inspection yes your honor all access i discussing except public tours fact started proceeding started so i answer your honors question way the mail time proceeding started i say – inmate lacked cash pay stamps postage anything like that provided secondly time proceeding started visiting ample visiting it unquestioned ample categories persons may visit they need members family anything else anyone including reporter could visit there restrictions prison under18 prison restriction stems provisions california penal code again time proceeding started access telephones maximum security facility there telephone access collect basis anyone the phone lines go sheriffs department anyway went right telephone company so monitoring capacity us find called what said nothing totally open telephones other maximum security facility telephone access correctional services officers again mr justice stevens time proceeding started interviews pretrial detainees available those could done fact would done typically premises those could photographed tape recorded they would private one sheriffs department would the requirement consents previously obtained inmate counsel district attorney court jurisdiction trial what present time proceedings commenced tours however i believe appendix page 10  beg your pardon page 19 appendix i reading affidavit mr turner counsel plaintiffs june 10 week proceedings filed spoke i told tour so situation time proceedings commenced tours planed scheduled well known everyone including plaintiffs fact would begin it true fact begun it necessary sheriff secure funding board supervisors go  bureaucracy things take time unfortunately cannot spring action the tours cover record shows virtually entire facility screening visitors it  record indicates many places taken ordinary citizens people curiosity going jail the tour see inmates inmates  i better specific certainly might see talk communication inmates members tour the tours time 25 persons approximately 30 four guards plainly conversation inmates visitors impossible no cameras permitted tours tape recorders permitted tours they commencement tours your honor better access anyone else announcement tours made media it fact suggestion members board supervisors first tour set aside entirely media discussion – suggestion rejected grounds wanted go knew anyone else file  exactly they became first six months tours became booked quickly quite possibly end july first tour july 14 1975 probably i remember recollection your honor end july tours booked that correct could gone one tours course means access your honor had occurrence jail indeed tours ever started media alternate means finding going means interviews i completed access available media to public this  became available public media greater access public i beg pardon your honor yes your honor i saying i might misspeak yes exactly that right your honor yes would nothing record case your honor indicate alternative means i say i finished media pardon access package taken whole entire package so riot fire something like means access media alternative means interviews something nature participants not capacity go cameras least demand one i want get one specific media access media alone special tours cameras tapes scheduled basis critical demand scheduled basis fix schedule whatever schedule district court mind keys turned schedule propagated sheriff still willing that part course finally release bus contact inmates alright completes your honors access exists the complaint kqed respect random interviews tours inmates view cameras cells barracks eating televising access demand equipment as i indicated access equipment schedule basis demand the district court make finding intention conceal conditions jail nevertheless district court made injunction requires sheriff allow called full accurate news coverage specifically required sheriff permit random interviews tours permit use cameras tapes plainly schedule tour demand tour the exception stated district courts memorandum injunction tensions fact existed sheriff could put stop stop access in fact district court virtually invited litigation point says anybody thinks really tension come hearing so district court balanced asserted media needs sheriffs public access program there balancing district court publics rights anyway the district court address public rights anyway yes i think i i think public rights access yes your honor no question well well entirely clear in pell case court i i read case court found intention conceal conditions the court found public access enough two factors plainly  nothing swept rug nothing hidden at least court determined public access adequate statement court now i appreciate reason i hesitate mr justice rehnquist i appreciate public access case strictly speaking issue placed issue indeed exactly court said but i read decision saying means necessarily public access zero that resolved decision court i aware it placed issue case that point certainly that well  is whether correct position logical yes logical position your honors position  i convinced considering body i speaking i convinced court held pell absolutely no question well i  exactly position your honor it dealt court deal i asked i think no i urging that position first place your honor  respect tried district court we urged that issue our position district court extend public access measured course automatically sets medias access rights but tried district court kqeds position district court district court adopted special things media tried media access case public access case i want emphasize one thing access read district courts opinion mainly something tours access tours access visitation access mails court said strong things mail rights prisons instance procunier versus martinez court said cannot censoring without lot due process protections there may well right visits particularly per county jail half inmates pretrial detainees special rights might appertain entirely convict population yes your honor no record tell as i recall visiting  well i want go outside record it tell it thing tour oh yes yes tell honor in  instance appendix page 41 i believe dealing minimum security inmates visiting sundays greater visiting pretrial detainees we orders district court different judge judge inaudible visiting greater visiting pretrial detainees yes correct i perhaps misunderstood courts question it isnt expanded in maximum security facility case present indicated understanding glass telephones across table so seems come i consider real legal issue situation adequacy public rights access unchallenged there determination intention conceal must sheriff give access rights greater media gives public briefs cited courts cases back approximately 20 years all effect press greater rights public gather information talking access rights the two latest cases court view controlling pell case saxbe referred issue case interviews media specifically named inmates granted available general public court held case court applied general rule stated press greater rights since public right interview specifically named inmates press need given either now true case media greater access public they right interview encounter randomly course tours instance kqed argues greater media access fact existed case court held constitutionally compelled greater media access issue it merely existing situation there controversy it placed issue litigant there nothing decide nothing resolve hence view holding contended kqed he two respects your honor he gives press tours cameras tape recorders schedule  no your honor i say  i might i  i mean i said it critical it uncritical it fact  pell saxbe  yes your honor that correct yes your honor i believe that would denied yes right no well i know whether right that sheriffs policy sheriffs policy something specially media i find i resume rest time rebuttal thank you thank you mr chief justice may please court couple points the court asked questions visiting it true happen know inmate may visit any prisoner could write member press could telephone ask come sunday pretrial detainee tuesday wednesday thursday matter we talking consents requirement consents sheriff require consents attorneys courts it seems likelihood harm interview pretrial detainee detainee sheriffs view would rather stay parties attorneys courts responsible decide whether interview filming recorders permitted i want point court access public case greater public access pell instance pell mail access subject censoring appropriate due process protections in case mail totally uncensored in pell visits limited certain groups persons case visits limited in pell public access tour cover entire facility cover maximum security area instance one year wait saw inmates took cameras in case see facility except greystone no except little greystone your honor well except say facility except little greystone little greystone your honor barracks facility barracks facilities seen identical right exception there exception incidentally mr justice white asked reference brief page 11 this scheduled tours media reference record displayed well opponent seem differ substantially quality kind access available suit began now findings actually district court the district courts memorandum findings directed almost entirely critic public tours point view reporter so findings there findings so two fighting evidence record that correct respect i afraid true your honor and description special press tour say  in record your honor page 11 opening brief page 11 okay thank i  district court your honor i previous experience late chief judge i really cannot speak i think substantially completes  mr booty may i ask one question certainly your honor precisely question asked decide  yes your honor it claim district courts approach injunction proper if someone tried establish noted private persons parties case testify naacp plaintiffs if representatives public challenged public access program possible district court could determined properly improperly i know could determined public access program adequate that never done i  yes would opinion the error i understand holding court pell saxbe cannot need give press greater access public  it would cured odd error would cured error whether access whatever required that different issue course never reached your honor but first issue decided would agree yes i thank your honor,417.0,535,27,we hear arguments next number1310 houchins station kqed mr booty may proceed ready mr booty i interrupt one question is first question whether violation law entitled remedy requires examination situation time law brought should not tell us kind access proceeding started what opportunity members media become one 25 admitted tours basically tours organized first come first serve basis did one briefs records state opinion overbooked weeks advance and occurrence jail might public interest would way representing media get jail unless signed several weeks advance you still outlining access available it addition rights public additional rights in event existing regime media rights public access plus additional ones granted sheriffs office mr booty outlining i gather general rule general policies sheriffs office are designed cover situation supposing riot broken jail event particular newsworthiness would regulations necessarily governed press public access circumstances when say public right talking term meaning constitutional law is sheriff alameda county elected official and i presume public alameda county thought getting enough access could vote next election and right access public i mean say decided cases court under constitution united states as interpreted court was pell really decision said whatever public access media access need greater but specifically mr booty seriously contend whole problem could solved zero access public press why it perfectly logical position take what court held pell i understood writing press right access superior general public it hold deal whether general public right whatsoever that counted constitution first fourteenth amendment provisions document and would urge court take extreme position would mr booty i ask one question access time lawsuit started one points visiting people could visit prisoners inmates requested does record tell us scope visit could others words could visitor could visitor see does record tell does record i  course i question statement record tell us visiting case it tell us well page tell us something nature visiting rights that tells us barracks auditorium rather wait barracks it implies would unrestricted access entire facility yeah  it indicate physical contact visitor inmate does mean talk glass window i see did say earlier argument sheriff willing willing give press greater access public you say critical case was word used you mean but wholly inconsistent present argument if critical but far  according present argument could eliminate special privilege press and could tell briefs described special press privilege is opening brief and member question members public nonpress members said would like go press tour cameras what would say because public much right press well press sued  private person one goes press tour cameras sued what would say would say  would say required give equal access press in short press greater privilege is saying my worry describe mr turner is court district court area generally enter injunctions without specific findings fact is view basis injunctive relief asking injunction entirely set aside claim one excessive relief granted well court persuaded time law suit brought virtually  insufficient access quite zero close enough zero denial first amendment rights public press arguing preliminarily injunction press said least give us much granted relief press would constitutional error could cured constitutional error saying public press shall entitled relief exactly relief  thank gentlemen the case submitted,970.0,1251,11,mr chief justice may please court first i would like correct state evidence the sheriff never since office held special tour press nothing record support all said became clear evidentiary hearing case would willing court going grant preliminary injunctive relief live special tour press could bring cameras business way he never implemented offer and context offer carried district court going order anything otherwise willing i think permissible for administrator jail prison  a constitutional question arises case sheriff limits access reporters either zero case filed antiseptic guided tours initiated right filed suit there constitutional issue i access zero access reasonably sufficient prevent consummative conditions jail would situation south africa press effectively precluded reporting jail prison conditions well first amendment case i think would trivialize first amendment say requires specific things like particular number days week photographs random interviews opposed full interviews individuals i think first amendment what first amendment prohibit government official unjustifiably interfering acquisition information publication that case well i justiciable yes position our position course press entitled sit conferences court court administrative agency yes and information claim confidentiality theoretically yes fact agencies aware treats information way sheriff the evidence case shows jails prisons area completely open press may enter go maximum security sections talk prisoners interview prisoners take pictures whatever want those institutions one would assume public access rather limited justifiably no course because shows unjustifiable sheriffs practice that valid interest well i think i know presidents reasons might opening cabinet meetings but surely context court deliberation going freedom take opposite points view ultimately handed decision kind discussion nature confidential i think would well relevant show unjustifiable sheriffs practice it dispositive case court court might radically different considerations i would like answer mr justice stevens opening question state access suit filed there none until suit filed conditions jail concealed public sheriff completely excluded press public facility well attorney could go interview client visiting room yes course course mail prisoners people outside time filed suit sheriffs rule bad prisoners mentioning name action officer changed immediately filed suit but course social mail visiting family friends serves purpose cutting prisoners outside world they maintain contact but serve purpose informing public going jail conduct elected sheriffs office the practice i understand anybody could visit prisoner if happen know one if happen know somebody could ask and willing talk you could talk visiting area no would permitted that would permitted unless reporters obtained four consents mentioned counsel prisoner certainly reasonable lawyer certainly reasonable sheriff required consent district attorney reasons unknown us unexplained court jurisdiction case this gag rule problem this standard procedure made exceedingly difficult interviews same rule same rule changed no the feasible way public large know going in jail reporters allowed a handful people go tours reporters acting agent public large eyes ears public large go without disruption jail routine done routinely jails prisons area meet public need without interfering purpose valid purpose sheriff no would mr chief justice would helpful but visiting board could exist go occasional basis facility inspection if charged gathering information event public concern position go jail investigate find happen report public promptly would serve purpose now sheriff answering reporters allowed job job done jails prisons area points courts decisions pell saxbe core position needs provide quality access access equality way reads decisions we think whole assumption pell saxbe decisions reasonably sufficient access prevent concealment conditions if equality fine we claim superior rights press yes exactly we quarrel courts holdings pell saxbe there rather full access reporters could enter institutions go maximum security sections talk prisoners randomly encountered take photographs thing could purposes access denied single individual prisoners make media heroes interviewed come public attention evidence case that indeed created security problems the court appalled narrow restriction access certainly sufficient access prevent concealment conditions prison quarrel either broad greater access statement court cases provided understood sufficient access prevent concealment that right no well yes well situation case filed public  that right if press public wholly excluded case filed indeed the difference kinds closed institutions one two first information discussed cia various government agencies mentioned information properly made public well going jail information claim confidentiality well claim sheriff anything happens jail held secret public well i saying seek access information claim confidentiality indeed extent governmental interest yes course governmental interest inaudible confidentiality discipline paying troops yes indeed oh course we conceive believe proper test one court used martinez obrien governmental interest whether interest confidentiality information security problems important governmental interest of course access could denied well maybe sheriff never advanced consideration he certainly that right the district court invalidated it found interest advanced sheriff though important means exclusion used necessary serve interests of course access denied emergency question that built district courts order all district court said reasonable times see meaning reasonable notice sheriff may completely refuse access time thinks discretion according district courts order tensions jail would authorize close the second one institution whose purpose involuntary confinement people opportunity reaching liberties people involuntarily confined little opportunity come public knowledge unless reporters permitted well would represented public defender pretrial detainees the half prisoners convicted serving misdemeanor sentences short felony terms i understand right counsel oh course could mail court writ habeas corpus but way bringing public attention sheriffs stewardship facility well might writ heard on evidence happens prisoners file writs hold plenary hearing inquire conditions probably 99 writs denied similarly hearing yes would well sheriff prevent what prevents responsibility journalism they going print unsubstantiated information received prisoner whether letter otherwise without opportunity verify allegations made prisoner that missing cannot go prisoners says terrible fire next cell somebody badly injured nobody get find well visit sentence prisoner three hour visiting period sundays yes could see scene you idea conditions look like should press take prisoners word looks like happened without checking i think certainly client thinks well way business the president united states cannot required meet press constitution i beg pardon no i think court could order senator sit meet press we trying use first amendment freedom information act we saying sheriff come meet press open files tell us anything happened he cannot shut door us ground required equality even equality zero that correct it mysterious system mr justice powell the sheriffs position allow visiting practically anyone so reporter reporter happens know somebody jail kqed reporters could go ask person regular visiting hours visit without recording equipment photographs anything nature in order sheriff calls interview four formal consents required if know somebody ask person willing talk yes we tours preliminary  the propriety district courts preliminary injunction grants pendency litigation reasonable access  that way sheriff closes issue yes yes well extent  well want special privilege want access sufficient prevent concealment conditions yes  yes also defending district courts order provides reasonable access authorizes sheriff figure access organized  that way sheriff poses issue whether constitution  yes injunction a greater access county jail  does terms access reporters exactly want reversal message jailers throughout land access never required constitution position oppose is whether was abusive discretion well constitutionally  well constitutionally impermissible sheriffs exclusion it requires access district court  different access press public large doubt yes well issue but access implemented expressly left sheriff determine first instant district courts order we hope upon remand district court work details conditions never escape public scrutiny i sure i think four year term i know your honor he came office january 1st 1975 yes yes attached affidavit affidavit appendix attached record case appendix rules prevail suit brought that right,912.0,1128,53,what say rights individual walks day press scheduled tour says i camera i amateur photographer i want go along do think sheriff exclude private citizen do think matter prison jail administration director sheriff could say convenient keep two categories separate general public visitation first monday every months media representatives second monday every month as administrative matter any constitutional question involved kind decision routine administration institution well gives media precisely exactly access public think constitutional problem involved what part constitution draw say right access take pictures things when say unjustifiably interfering acquisition information publication justiciable question every case whether instance supreme court united states excludes press conferences whether federal aviation administration excludes press executive sessions well  tested way it something subject constitutional inquiry court decide constitutional questions whether decision governmental official exclude press part public domain control called “justifiable” but justifiable decision part but case could go united states district court whatever district want 1331 argue constitutional question whether decision particular agency justifiable let us suppose president decides cabinet meetings open media television instance does mean courts open conferences someone else well significance prisons area different practice well president opens cabinet meetings tv could united states court appeals court claims justifiable reason excluding well suppose united states courts appeals decide open conferences television does mean courts got they engaged kind decisional function then someone else really relevant is there i presume access sixth fourteenth amendment at reasonable time well time time suite started could member press interview prisoner visiting hours prisoner willing interviewed including press and answer yes well recording interview willing prisoner or photograph a willing photograph what rule what rule on visitors visiting and court order change what would say old fashioned system existed least century ago boards visitation reported semiannually quarterly local governing body created six citizens designated mayor court someone made visits regularly reported publicly would say would satisfy publics right  i put limit indeed times beginning colonial days boards visitors visited institutions way bank examiners today unannounced how read well claim i suppose certainly could reasonably claim even though right access communications media greater general public perhaps technical needs communications need media equality needs provided different kind way in words let us say right existing rules regulations public go certain rooms white house within certain hours everyday well press could set television cameras interfere interfering certainly equivalent availability communications media sort public access rooms white house open public might require special arrangements make setup television cameras something else hour public fact just order preserve provide equality media entitled well far argument go there many areas would agree public fact access let say oval office white house general right access general public time 24 hours day seven day week extent access period extent public know goes it knows press officers white house yet mean reason another fact public admitted press must well argument let us assume particular county jail public admitted except terms  general public members families lawyers doctors let general public know fact press gain access seems argument i understand i talking policy prudential considerations wisdom lack taking required first fourteenth amendments else case and mere fact public access thereby confer right upon press access that brand new doctrine i never heard and many areas public life governmental life excluded war room pentagon i assume various parts cia pointed various private meetings sort commissions courts everything else how know properly made public claim confidentiality first fourteenth amendments well make claim first fourteenth amendments constitution so say something claim confidentiality must part first fourteenth amendments otherwise cannot prevail well maybe reasons public given access outside confidentiality the reasons security discipline fact jail jail a troop could commander military station could certainly keep members public observing certain troop activities i assume it maybe part punitive policy particular governmental agency might jail going members general public around we going  maximum security institution one conditions jail going able associate even peripherally members general public why would perfectly legitimate governmental interests well attacking done it saying done unconstitutional violative united states constitution he justify invalidate mr turner answer mr justice stewarts question difference claim rights interest finding happens governmental conferences whether secrecy like said two differences one absence interest confidentiality interest confidentiality cases never get second point do people right access lawyer but court held right access court day ph oh seems might appropriate way precisely and filed court matters public record available press is anything prevent every prisoner institution whether pretrial detainee conviction writing long long letter wife mother lawyer published letters editor cannot go interview particular day could verify corroborate story develop interview or press take presidents press secretarys word presidents view without going oval office checking well way business alameda county we dealing constitutional issue what united states senator how united states senator normally hundred 435 members house mr turner proceed i confused facts respect personal interviews representative media preselected inmate i understood say earlier perhaps i narrow say four preconditions interview including court approval when say interview mean television equipment tape recorders you simply go interview prisoner visiting hours without four requirements nice place would go notebook well i thought issue propriety injunction issued ordering special tours press cameras recording equipment that think issue tell and issue court appeals i understand according opinions whether granting press access prison different public proper necessary question raised petition certiorari and defend opinion court appeals and sole issue not whether generally whether whether sheriff satisfactory access program the issue whether injunction giving special privilege press constitutionally required oh i know got say defending court appeals opinion must defend proposition  because said expressly held special privilege press quite proper that maybe case issue special privilege press question petition certiorari well one granted then listen question mr turner  correct statement question question presented whether district court erred granting preliminary injunction question ask form preliminary injunction but whether injunction granted well granted but side  relief requested side vacation entire injunction change terms  well i still ask think question presented petition certiorari court i would doubt sheriff would like get press hair issue  yes court appeals said remedy granted district court giving special access press it said quite proper apparently thought constitutionally required otherwise i know district judge business ordering press ordering sheriff issue special access press he must thought constitutionally required first amendment you put way want i gather think constitution required injunction issued district court some access special access sheriff houchins told elected official do know longer term you many terms served one so first term mr turner sit record includes visiting rules affect june 75 shows revised june 75 does record contain rules affect june 75 revision i understand controversy

death petitioners there cruel unusual punishment within eight fourteenth amendment constitution the cases present range factual situations in first aikens case death penalty inflicted upon multiple murderer intentional killing particularly atrocious sort in second case furman case killing course burglary murder may may intentional attended aggravating circumstances third fourth cases jackson branch infliction death penalty crime rape the briefs parties amici canvas broad range considerations eight fourteenth amendments but i think mergers briefs clear impression central issue case real nerve controversy scope indeed propriety judicial review legislatives state legislative determinations use penalty death the briefs behalf respondents primarily support death penalty ground exists statute books 41 states federal government and put legislatures 41 states federal government legislatures primary keepers national conscience penal matters and elected representatives people whose judgment entitled respect i agree i think beginning end analysis eight amendment judicial review legislative judgment inevitable difficult under constitution commits courts protection individual guarantee cruel unusual punishment due process equal protection laws precisely guarantees fundamental statements basic principles society the least conferring narrow historical circumstances gave birth they cast general terms generality makes difficult interpret also creates risk mr justice frankfurter frequently warned court court may read dispositions constitution but time general prescriptions bedrock constitution designed endure time give continuing constant expression notion limitations power government deal individuals guarantee cruel unusual punishment due process equal protection broad statements grand form cash unforeseeable future intended construed give continuing protection limitations upon governmental power such protections individual likely often added constitution amending process needed least likely commend political approval necessary add put general form committed courts construe times change life nation visit constitution i conclude that although difference circumspection legislative judgment vital that abnegation judicial legislative judgment impermissible existence clause like eight amendment prohibition cruel unusual punishment belies idea legislatures totally free choice penalogic methods the important thing plain it cruel unusual punishment clause restriction legislation in context american government penal sanctions primarily legislative it meant limit legislative means court fact pretty times appied invalidate legislation cases fact applied clause vindicate plan the question limitations legislative judgment how stringent where court get standards determine the problem standards critical generality cruel unusual punishment i described the language crystalline clear cannot look punishment see whether cruel cannot look see whether unusual and history although relevant cannot controlling evolutionary nature guarantee projection future i described the state california state georgia texas extent briefs made point time eight amendment written capital punishment widely used the fifth amendment clearly envisages capital cases the federal congress put capital statutes books all misconceived i think submission court eight amendment ratified 1791 intended capital punishment anymore intended away whippings brandings cutting beers anymore equal protection clause originally put constitution intended give equal rights indigents women in view mr amsterdam would congress authority legislation field concerning state eight amendment would congress power prohibit death penalty eight amendment oh surely your honor in state in state yes your honor go  i know i say would congress  congress done anything intent with regard capital punishment state yes no your honor bills submitted senator hart congressman seller would impose moratorium execution was past it even come committee hearing your honor that correct mr stewart the problem construing eight amendment emerges i think i said language isnt clear history controlled court get standards find basis judgment determining whether legislation cruel unusual the primary problem formulations frequently find lard port cases announcement punishment may shot conscience court unnecessarily cruel thing in wide subjective judgment one thing i think parties may your honor purpose constitution allow judges write penalogical reflections the arguments made state case sustain capital punishment would i think equally sustain branding confidence meant forehead letter c cutting hands pickpockets atrocious punishments and punishments i think would plainly condemned eight amendment beholds us ask is simply would shocked would testimony uphold punishments punishment death i think i think objective judicially cognizable basis making determination eight amendment and brief tried set forth standards objective standard judicial judgement specifically think question eight amendment whether punishment applied particular individual would available objective indications unacceptable general contemporary conscience standards decency it generally uniformly applied reasonable proportion persons subject penalty crime that true mr justice douglas true cases death penalty discretionary either judge jury depending tries  each four no indeed state policy simply penalty death available imposed particular murder particular class murder there nothing  there nothing record indeed record cases court discloses judicially noticeable findings i believe set brief reflect precision those factors nothing record supports state california thrown brief could deal material neither record judicial noticeable there published materials racial statistics i think judicially noticeable nothing record mr justice douglas the reason urge standard i described proper standard eight amendment what court must is look see whether punishment inflicted particular case would tolerable acceptable prevailing standards decency generally applied is essentially treatable i three considerations commend standard court and i say i take courts time point talk eight amendment standard court little developed theory concept eight amendment and parties i think disagreement theory eight amendment aspect case any good three reasons first conception theory eight amendment picks appropriate count different nature different roles constitution legislature courts legislatures primarily concerned application penalties particular cases as mr justice douglass question suggests legislature regard capital punishment simply said death available penalty it may never used may rarely infrequently used there number left knowledge one capital crime united state men death row most obsolete prison state sort thing mr justice stewart the one crime california crime 4500 california penal crime resolved life time inmate upon noninmate person assaulted dies that mandatory capital crime i know anyone death row standard there statutes essentially absolute impose oh yes it development death penalty made discretionary that correct state yet left mandatory capital punishment murder rape either crimes involved ordinary crimes capital punishments that right pardon that correct the district columbia new york last two united states  less mandatory  capital sentencing provision the second— none mr justice douglas entirely— the aikens case tried sentencing done judge in jury tried case california trial judge may set aside jurys verdict the california supreme court may review sentence whether imposed judge jury the second reason i think theory standard eight amendment commends court assigns proper function eight amendment constitution democracy democracy likely legislature put statute books penalty cruel unacceptable public conscience generally applicable uniform fashion a stature going generally applied would repugnant public conscience generally applied commend enough public acceptance get statute first place the problem democracy legislation maybe inactive form arbitrarily selectively spottily applied outcast thrive whose political positions weak personal situation popular ugly public revulsion would follow uniform application penalties applied follow outcast creatures condemned punishment what saying essentially punishment cast form used way comes court suspect eight amendment actually applied infrequently incredibly relict death penalty suspicion materializes penalty identified cruel unusual punishment this new constitutional conception i really saying nothing mr justice stone said footnote 4 carolene products legislation cast form unlikely make politically remediable sterilize ordinary political processes keep legislature acting decently keep legislation reflective public conscience then particular obligation devolves court assess constitutionality legislation the third reason i think theory eight amendment amends court is imbibe subjective judicial judgment it ask court put position super legislature decide matters penalogical policy in fact theory i believe offers alternative subjective judicial judgment one looks moment grounds state seek support capital punishment retribution permissible legislative aim cases retribution requires killing people deterrence permissible legislative aim legislature could find capital punishment something deterrent efficacy you immediately see arguments could would made legislature fraud boiling oil punishment crime legislature might say horrible curse let boiling oil that could fit retribution crime legislature might direct awful thing we got stop way really make horrible prevent correct boiling oil boiling oil and state could able make essentially arguments making capital punishment in favor capital punishment arguments would sustained would sustained boiling oil somehow shocking digestive system intestinal reaction people particular judges i think i think objective standards invite court apply capital punishment generally would offended boiling oil and i think offended form infliction death penalty debt only limited sense mr justice douglas fourteenth amendment applies guaranty eight amendment state there within scope grant certiorari case independent due process question question raised no mr justice stewart i think i agree i think semantic problem i think  yes i think right your honor i think difference explicit permission simply negative inference fact certain guarantees say death penalty imposed certain procedures must followed must grand jury indictment must due process law i think one say language constitution inference permits death penalty meant project continuing permission i think one say long death penalty could imposed imposed could imposed within restrictions i think takes us back initial question i think i urging anybody put language constitution meant provoke capital punishment i think meant put several guarantees rights one guaranty cruel unusual punishment would grow involve society grew involve another guaranty right life liberty property taken away without due process law right prosecution indictment sort thing said describing legislature could they said seeks take away light inference this—then conceived time state might take away life it procedure there projection forward notion taking life permissible they simply statement know taking life permissible long permissible guarantees must obtain i think inconsistency if one simply recognize historical fact cruel unusual punishment clause  grow evolve a last point i think significance i turn capital punishment theory eight amendment also without historical support the eight amendment seems advent result confluence three primary concerns a concern excessive punishments see english laws far back part concern selective imposition harsh punishments concern without right better the immediately relevant one i think second the concern selective use harsh criminal punishment immediately led english bill rights provision 1689 language eight amendment the english bill rights provision put largely result inaudible and look back trial vote see actual punishment imposed earth barbaric it  divested clergy man imprisoned life pilloried whipped annually occasion perjuries conviction and complaint lodged judgment led bill rights harsh time still killing thousands people it wasnt intrinsically barbaric it selective one fellow singled given unprecedentedly harsh punishment now capital punishment functioning today precise reflect happenned inaudible waking life leads mention i arguing selective cases i would develop part constitutional argument second but simply state first essence argument applying theory eight amendment exceeding contemporary rarity capital punishment the fact death penalty although allowed law overwhelming majority american jurisdiction fact applied infrequently penalty frauds background ideological debate makes clear attrition use death penalty repudiation that circumstance presents us primary objective indicator court say longer true court suggested cope v dallas ph death penalty still generally accepted but contrary death penalty virtually unanimously repudiated condemned conscience contemporary society now developing point factually i think difficult the national crime commission study three years ago pointed salient characteristic capital punishment infrequency use and every inform commentator studied perhaps accepting respondents cases come conclusion i may read professor herbert wechlers description i think fair one there striking contrast broad extent penalty death authorized law relative infrequency sentence actually imposed carried despite imperfections data clear capital punishment executed fraction cases legally imposed a fraction trivially infirmity steadily diminishing recent years i say rely dwindling zero death penalty last years that course large measure result judicial status but i would point even national campaign began secured judicial status 1967 during decade 60’s executions united state dropped average 20 year high almost 200 ordinary normal 175 150 previous decades i also point number death sentences returned juries decade 60’s 1968 100 year now talking country 52 jurisdictions competent impose capital punishment population 200 million people 43 jurisdiction actually use death penalty crime 100 people convicted capital punishment 20 actually executed i  courts pleasure serve continuation theme argument,221.0,248,9,027 aikens california mr amsterdam may proceed whenever ready congresss power would section five fourteenth amendment would in standing statute first case judge discretion impose concluded right do mean four so statement state policy arguing people inaudible is anything method shows congress people death penalty  death penalty imposed their annual income race religion social status are dark are states left legislature said death penalty inexorably follows conviction certain offense there used many left but statutes court in many states used true first degree deliberate murder and state left longer  longer except exceptional kind certain statute  it 10 years ago isnt the congress abolished mandatory death penalty district columbia inaudible under inaudible are standards cases exercise discretion judge jury as matter california law discretion reviewable exercise discretion reviewable you raise question due process clause fourteenth amendment at state inaudible but interrupted let interrupt due process clause fourteenth amendment one  i think bothers case i think matter semantic fact due process clause deprivation life expressly mentioned least negative implication expressly permitted state deprive person life liberty property without due process law it another expressed almost identical mention fifth amendment united states constitution indeed i think fifth amendment reference capital cases implicit approval explicitly constitution united states and i say semantic problem there least three maybe places constitution know occur one death penalty mentioned implicit approval and talking practice time constitution adopted i talking word constitution united states invoking case thank very well mr amsterdam mr george,1525.0,2086,6,i try anticipate remainder professor amsterdams argument follow case the basic issue court course whether death penalty socially morally politically desirable advantageous instead whether specific provisions federal constitution bars people state california case determining elected representative death penalty available possible form punishment would offense murder do information kind people california executes yes i certainly appendix brief summarized short manner case reached california supreme court last six years well since 1965 also certain table brief indicating ratio make persons receiving death sentences rather death row also data regarding social economic status get detail the petitioner comes bearing indeed heavy burden establishing california legislature lacks permissible basis upon conclude protection society requires availability death penalty serious crimes willful malicious taking human life punishment death a form punishment history man now professor amsterdam takes position least 10 ago i california supreme court issue even could conclusively established death penalty deter saves innocent peoples lives thereby death penalty would still cruel unusual punishment that would impermissible form punishment well well one qualification remark one explanation would course execution done humane manner and—what i would like develop length court’s treatment concept cruel unusual punishment i think one key aspects cruel the term defined wilkerson case francis versus restwaiver definition cruelty terms unnecessary cruelty unnecessary pain want infliction pain yes no unnecessary cruelty i think if rational people could conclude i think enactment eight amendment intended bar certain torture punishment i think capital punishment tortures standards altogether existed 1791 and i think start proposition death penalty clearly constitutional period eight amendment adopted your honor pointed specific mention fifth amendment taking life capital offense course capital offenses enacted federal government state legislatures immediately preceding following adoption cruel unusual punishment one must ask rhetorically constitution unconstitutional and recognition capital offenses taking taking life now years some scholars particularly article cited mr branuchi seemed indicate definite lack precision uses term might meant something different time first adopted threatened mistaken mean something different time used i think cruel unusual means two things basically defined courts opinion trying synthesize various opinion wilkerson 1878 francis versus restriver weiver 1947 follows punishment held unconstitutional true unusual either first punishment inherently cruel inherently unusual form now wilkerson i stated speak terms punishment torture others involving unnecessary cruelty now cited approval henry camler decision added definition punishments cruel involve torture lingering death punishment death cruel cruelty implies something barbarous extinguishment life now wing court quoted proof oath the wilkerson definition language hemler francis versus restweiver preceded define cruelty terms infliction walton unnecessary pain said cruelty constitution protects convicted man cruelty inherent method punishment not necessary surfing involved method employed extinguish life humanely in unusual i think mean unusual something customary height offense as 1791 i would like detail deal argument professor amsterdam word somehow change meaning year year i think whatever unusual cruel might certain things usual 1791 subject cruel i think two concepts intervention i get unusual i think customary punishment wing good example—it punishment less life perhaps one might call cruel court expressed highly unusual something totally keeping concept common law punishment involves certain civil disabilities find white collar crime change  i believe that option state utah i sure states i think utah even shooting option that right it think terms— pardon speak  we talking i think methods execution we talking certain kind proportionality now maybe certain types tortures available either 1791 mean covered i think basically eight amendment intended apply types things 1791 today fact recently 1958 court cope v dallas ph regarded death penalty employed throughout history still widely accepted it cannot said violate constitutional concept cruelty the court noted imprecision certainly use words i think opinion come definition i gave first part second principle i think far cruel unusual concerned would involve punishment inherently cruel unusual form unconstitutional grossly excessive applied either relationship seriousness particular offense relationship status involve uncompelled act involve robinson versus california case i think tests applied offense murder clear cruel unusual punishment certainly humane method intentional cruelty fact death comes prisoner perhaps frequently less cruel death natural process comes us eventually so— nobody knows state medical knowledge today i think assume since death comes within matter second whatever might physical reflex actions professor amsterdam chosen i think speed criterion apparently according medical authority involve less pain method court certainly found past i think anything petitioner able show would lead us believe involve  involves necessary intentional torturing the test whether cruelty beyond threat punishment cruel putting man behind bars might cruel especially life test the test unnecessary cruel now although court cope v dallas ph went way uphold constitutionality death penalty petitioner ceases upon certain language opinion the evolving standards decency marked progress maturing society sort talismanic death knell 300 years capital punishment those words represent opinion four members board time one member makes part constituency present form certainly meaning cruel unusual static emphasize words cannot change year year i know professor amsterdam mind meaning cruel unusual 1962 65 petitioner committed crime 1969 judgment california supreme court affirmed 1972 vigorously rejected notion terms cruel unusual change affirmatively year year where case indeed evolving standards decency might regress as germany 1940s 50s what burning oil tortures fact become popular vote mind populous would mean suddenly constitutional fluid meaningless eight amendment i think rather primitive corporal punishments use time eight amendment enacted mean capital punishment stand fall together the framers eight amendment may well intended outlaw punishments indeed punishments although might survived time enactment eight amendment never sanctified constitutional decision court unlike capital punishment method inflictions least sanctified and never sanctifying tortures constitution capital punishment fifth amendment use capital offenses use taking life no i think framers eight amendment attempts sanctify either i think were— i think speaking broadly corporal punishment i think would necessarily mean taking limb i think would mean perhaps certain corporal punishment survives might survive today though i think that— i convinced let us say form whipping would necessarily unconstitutional 20 lashes maybe murdering somebody might unusual today i certainly think would perhaps mind i think petitioner therefore quite incorrect stating say death penalty alright means burning oil tortures necessarily alright now i would like take second factor even assume meaning cruel unusual change decade decade progress perhaps regret i would submit standards evolved point imposition death penalty could offensive murder inconsistent standards i know change 1791 since 1958 decision court cope v dallas ph alter fact capital punishment part moral religious philosophical heritage always recognized indeed professor amsterdams fixation phrase evolving standards quite understandable provides arguable escape historical reality capital punishment recognized legitimate form punishment 300 years nation thousands years heritage now clear point petitioner wants us focus determining standard one thing clear conveniently chooses ignore fact 41 50 state capital punishment federal government eight states exempted abolition death penalty rejected the fact widespread support death penalty confined bill editors prosecutors eventual police officers we cited religious authorities think capital punishment permissible the polls certainly show majority population favor also ignored almost annual ritual california legislature bill produce abolish death penalty exempt defeated usually committee sometimes floor also ignored fact california legislature 1970 added new capital offense federal government 1961 65 so professor amsterdam choose focus attention he cites great length brief inaudible what relevance determine provisions adopted 791791 means reference cruel unusual punishment different countries different social conditions necessitating different forms punishment keeping mind needs protection society significantly non nations abolished death penalty judicially none knowledge petitioner fails even show trends regard there seen recent years great flurry jurisdiction rejecting capital punishment to quote professor patter time due process head count and particularly ridiculous petitioner brief although i know sort abandoned position today focus upon small number executions this posed indication declining popular acceptance death penalty now number execution declining indicator perhaps evolving standards judiciary chose judicial state indication popular feeling much accurate parameter evolving standards times the juries consistently steadily even increasingly california returning death penalty verdicts i think key 36 1970 a prisoner sentence death california and key thing whitherspoon teaches us one important function jury perform making selection life death maintain link temporary community values penal system and jury system i read place center briefs i agree i think assume jury violates i think basis fact lot allegations made professor amsterdam fact facts i think  i agree observation experience anything i read support i think key flaw whole approach petitioners evolving standard form  great trend great movement away capital punishment far values concerned reflected democratically active legislation why 41 states chosen  even professor amsterdam would believe people unpopular nobody going act behalf well i think case bills introduced abolished death penalty time in fact congress often act behest one single individual perhaps alien subject deportation without great resources enact special legislation allowing alien stay country we know bills so situation people unpopular full  inaudible i respect i put level due respect your honor far ability solitary individual whether right remain country right remain alive get legislation enacted benefit democratic process government i think basically professor amsterdam chooses ignoring indicias popular acceptance death penalty he seeks consider sort self appointed guardian evolving standards decency he cocounsel know truth wrong prove evolving standards indications disregarded i think opinion now i also object comes issue burden proof petitioners attitude somehow state obligation establish affirmatively aim punishment accomplished death penalty would served equally well imposition life term i think question i think get ticket problem deciding state justify life term without possibility parole i think life  life accomplish something fixed term years prison accomplished something inaudible i think really asking court become super legislature federal state relationship now basis petitioners argument must indeed permissible reason legislature conclude permissible aim punishment served death penalty i think clear reasonable basis exist i want labor length matter set forth brief great detail obviously first aim punishment rehabilitation served persons found unread bill inaudible aikens according unanimous testimony psychiatrist we set forth evidence deterrence our burden establish deterrence shown reasonable basis upon legislature conclude death penalty deter prisoners made statements police officers reporters the defendants said one whole dont shoot victim get us fried well man alive today death penalty legislature considered things opinion state supreme court dissenting justices love opinion cite relies much important statistical figures professor amsterdam undissentingly refers anecdotal impressions law enforcement he would like believe authority professor perhaps certain bias disregard pragmatic information now i would submit course death penalty would greater deterrent execution carried in fact rise crime rate execution stops might bail although i choose rest position statistics it clear third aim punishment incapacitation isolation served life term prisoners kill fellow prisoners guard escape parole i think retribution something considered well now i would like briefly point court briefs graphically refute statements petitioners discrimination imposition death penalty mentally deficiently uneducated poor ratio minority figures show graphically 38 first degree murder convictions poor negroes 25 got first degree murder convictions received death penalty negroes so discrimination it difficult understand anything discriminatory professor amsterdam says small portion condemned murders receive death penalty would prefer discretion abolished i cannot see unfair mass killers like manson family political assassins like sirhan three time killer like aikens receives death penalty people receive life now conclusion i would like state petitioners offered us objective standard cruel unusual he would court become super legislature enact personal views evolving standards society make showing regarding supposed lack protection afforded death penalty argument prevail indeed many persons might lose lives innocently removal protection death penalty i dwell length upon mr aikens crimes they concededly petitioner terribly brutal remorse mental problem he intelligent education committed three brutal murders so effect i would close statement justice homes jackman case if thing practiced 200 years common consent lead strong case fourteenth amendment effect respondent submits petitioner made strong case he made case respondent joins comment quoted justice shower former justice california supreme court us involved whole process death penalty even appellate level validly wish death penalty longer necessary yet reached utopian state meanwhile putting aside whatever personal feelings might nothing happened 180 years history constitution 300 year history capital punishment country would preclude people various states even considering question concluding society protection requires availability death penalty permissible form punishment certain aggravated offenses indeed cases set forth indicate aggravated offense receive death penalty juries discriminating discriminatory petitioner really seeking court relitigate decided last year mcgartha issue so plea consider things constitutional level without emotional rederick political personal moral feeling desirability death penalty we would submit judgement affirmed case death penalty clearly cruel unusual punishment,212.0,234,6,certainly would agree i impose argument insofar says deterrence sole criteria whether punishment cruel unusual well words i suppose disemboweling burning state drawing quadering might simply deterrence follow petty larceny would answer question well submission shown punishment served deterrent rational persons judgment appropriate deterrent form pain torture inflicted imposing deterrence necessary automatically constitutionally valid and would true horsewhipping  no rational people could conclude best deterrent petty larceny 50 lashes would cruel unusual long 51 lashes imposed fact argument do say unusual means meant means word unusual what mean all respect mr george i talking cruel unusual rules as as question say whatever unusual it one unusual date you cyclic back law time but unusual get back word unusual inaudible any states— inaudible inaudible how might i measure get inaudible instead unusual 1791 i cannot except nobody knows is death sentence inaudible the course fifth amendment also talks jeopardy limb double jeopardy provision first shall applying capital life limb i suppose would use argue today government could cut arm thief would without violating eight amendment where find word limb just like limb it suggested place brief inaudible one reason juries days inaudible

application the application first issue bankers trust issue definition since rests conclusion bankruptcy i think applies definition injury point trustees interest the preexisting debt owed her husband part racketeering scheme alleged when went bankruptcy owing somewhere neighborhood 14 million result property settlement debt preexisting legitimate debt unrelated racketeering activity alleged racketeering complaint yes he received statutory preliminary discharge yes joanne joanne trustee objected within 1 year statutory discharge claiming discharge obtained fraud that adversary complaint ultimately 1994 vincent settled estate joanne individually agreed discharge the order i dont believe record order bankruptcy court accepting settlement includes giving discharge 1994 preliminary discharge revoked i dont believe record yes sir the preliminary discharge chapter 7 bankruptcy granted within certain number months long one none creditors trustee object subject 1year period beyond automatic granting preliminary discharge creditors trustee object discharge ground obtained fraud joanne siragusa trustee file may 1989 yes joanne trustee filed may 1989 adversary complaint alleging among things discharge granted vincent preliminarily obtained fraud the ninth circuit found that date joanne injured our position debt preexisting debt day filed complaint day the focus racketeering scheme case focused bankruptcy fraud its classic attempt get legal obligation pay debt no your honor the two ways joanne injured bankruptcy fraud one debtor obtains discharge obligation pay thats removed secondly forced accept end bankruptcy less 100 percent debt owed started scheme reduction caused racketeering activity racketeering injury point well position bankruptcy complete whether shes injured whether preexisting nonrico debt affected racketeering activity cannot determined she filed protective cause action well i may dismissed bankers trust without prejudice she concerned jurisdiction would accept bankers trust line cases filed protective lawsuit assumption fear one courts jurisdiction would find differently well injury joanne accept argument respect bankers trust with respect trustee ninth circuit pegged injured may 1989 case still related second question whether decide proper approval rule civil rico case injuryinpattern discovery rule if decide trustees injury may 1989 doesnt start statute limitations ticking it wont tick december 1990 well i think bankers trust line cases would apply joanne yes your honor that would apply joanne definition assumes bankruptcy complete the record case stands ninth circuit concluded trustee injured may 1989 since would unaffected the ninth circuit rests decision assumption may 1989 joanne trustee recognized filed adversary complaint husband tried concoct bankruptcy scheme get paying legal obligation well racketeering complaint filed 19 well racketeering complaint different adversary complaint the racketeering complaint filed 1993 the racketeering activity schemes identified scheme defraud her legal debt scheme defraud husbands partners i think ninth circuit concluded may 1989 joanne trustee injured recognition vincent filed fraudulent bankruptcy no it hurt interest estate attempting fraudulently transfer assets people no he fraudulently transferred interest medical practice people that whole basis bankruptcy well assets transferred he trustee proceed recipients property attempt get back a settlement 1992 entered possessors fraudulently transferred property at yes joanne personally result yes he got im sorry at point justice oconnor asset medical practice diminished value entered settlement certain amount money came estate went joanne personally personally settled partners point also the racketeering scheme pattern thats alleged well estate vincent yet paid lawful debt joanne if take account settlement position estate point lost several hundred thousand dollars joanne definition also lost several hundred thousand dollars well i think clearly reduction value business i think allegation would business reduced course bankruptcy bankruptcy fraud proceeding bankruptcy hes pursuing the business worth certain amount money settled partners still pursuing lawsuit thats whole point attempting bring assets back estate pay creditors well i mean something addition submission false statements throughout bankruptcy assets intentions basically mr chief justice yes attempt transfer property claim longer assets pay debt wife go obtain discharge that heart bankruptcy fraud yes that well point fraudulent conveyance something bankruptcy he wanted go bankruptcy claim longer assets pay debts transferred obtain discharge legal debt wife emerge bankruptcy regain possession assets possessed first place thats classic bankruptcy fraud that scheme now turned joanne trustee discovered december 1990 scheme also potential victims the earliest predicate acts alleged complaint filing bankruptcy there bankruptcy fraud predicate act mail wire frauds the scheme alleged no i think suffices two second predicate act brings pattern defrauding vincents partners no im saying your honor i think question answered court in there may may pattern case alleged no i would disagree the pattern alleges rico complaint second part rico complaint scheme victim also served defraud others it may may but justice oconnor redefining pattern rico case the ninth circuit accepted given rico complaint decided injury i think that really starts sound little bit us like overpleading basically dispute husband he tried bankruptcy get pay now one predicate acts could allege pattern theres continuity relationship i dont know but case chose allege racketeering case we chose absolutely we included it quite lengthy quite detailed complaint pattern allege chooses proceed pattern includes no 19 yes absolutely a pattern yes that i think agree the ninth circuit decision second issue i think said decided accept injury pattern discovery rule complaint timely by deciding injury discovery rule complaint timely thing take ninth circuit found pattern alleged complaint evident december 1990 after injury occurred there justice kennedy number predicate acts alleged complaint the first injury several predicate acts in december 1990 discovers scheme designed defraud others occurs point pattern that well i dont im im sorry no i think fair suggest would difficult time proving continuity relationship threat continued activity dispute her husband well well i dont want say circumstances could single scheme multiple predicate acts constitute pattern thats decided hj what saying case individual predicate acts resulting injury constitute pattern i why because one victim i understand that dispositive one victim short period time basically was dispute growing divorce case husband tried get obligations well i but i think fairness way court defined pattern required plaintiff find sort continuity relationship threat continued criminal activity short period time recognizes husband tried defraud her debt would position that sufficient conclude even shes omniscient fact pattern i think well well i think issue court dealt hj single scheme even number predicate acts within short period time really essence dispute husband wife doesnt constitute kind continued criminal activity court contemplated defined pattern i think common sense approach plaintiffs practitioners would start think pattern different multiple victims yes the facts i think simply stated attempted fraudulent transfer reorganization medical practice designed defraud joanne wife one partners junior shareholders answer yes three intended victims pattern using medical practice enterprise it yes mr chief justice well there it establish pattern goes goes and theres threat well i think justice oconnor happened point year may 89 finds fraudulent transfer a year later december 1990 finds victims fraud in circuits would enough time allege pattern in circuits requirement activity needs go 2 years i would like reserve rest time i want make three points quickly number 1 joanne still received 14 million debt vincent went bankruptcy some money went trustee others went estate shes still received full amount in answer justice ginsburg question judge halls opinion clear judge hall agreed rendition pattern decided opinion ninth circuit decided injuryandpattern discovery rule applicable cause action case would timely yes i think choosing two rules ninth judge hall ninth circuit clearly decided gone way chosen injuryandpattern discovery rule complaint would timely issue case second pattern occurred our argument plaintiff reasonably said notice pattern occurred one key elements one unique elements statute in answer justice scalia question justice breyers question injury discovery rule racketeering statute completely unworkable reason a plaintiff may injured first predicate act at point notice inquiry notice yet cause action doesnt exist so instead diligent yes im sorry say no im assuming let explain if really question adopting injury discovery rule completely unworkable thats point right take fact first predicate act discovery youve injured first predicate act pattern predicate acts come later youve essence created two classes plaintiffs absolutely that im assuming that problem injury discovery rule hes arguing injury rule view completely inappropriate racketeering statute many predicate acts fraud claims court already decided holmberg v yonquist means fraud claim must able discover fraud statute limitations starts running when lay top requirement discover plead pattern difficulties intricacies defining finding pattern really created cause action nature fraud case nature case elements concealment continuity seems unfair say statute limitations youre required plead elements starts tick before,721.0,1041,54,well hear argument next number 951723 tom grimmett v patricia brown mr sauber are also representing trustee bankruptcy because interests seem diverge little bit i little curious argument going cover well could tell us preliminarily please whether vincent siragusa one point bankruptcy order discharged vincent siragusas debts has ever order come bankruptcy court changing i didnt see but order issued bankruptcy court reflecting so say wont find anywhere papers a preliminary discharge one could explain briefly that discharge obtained fraud mr sauber whats left injury incurred i mean i dont bankruptcy source injury bankruptcy it discharge bankruptcy if thats undone injury anybody complain case thats well has occurred and cause action injury occurs but authority rely mr sauber bankers trust says claim ripe bottom line case dismissal i frankly surprised urging preserve case injury yet occurred well injury yet occurred lawsuit ive objection dismissing without prejudice i dont know cannot dismissed injury we cant tell whether trustees injured either end bankruptcy when say bankers trust youre referring second circuit case how injured may 19 how injury trustee bankruptcy were two acts i thought youre claiming complaint person owes money joanne secured interest property figures way get rid secured interest hes going go bankruptcy secured interest disappear thats whole thing now thats whole thing i dont even see two acts where rico case much less the part is trustee hurt it thing isnt it thing what went bankruptcy wasnt entitled i mean i take i fraudulent scheme get 100000 bank might hurt bank might hurt depositors might hurt shareholders how two actions trustee go back justice scalias question trustee bankruptcy hurt rico proceeding it hurt feelings but transfer assets did anything it seems nothing the assets transferred trustee therefore collected less money bankruptcy estate that happened correct and trustee bankruptcy settlement trustee bankruptcy individuals got yes talking trustee did trustee get assets back bankruptcy estate right could answer sorry could i i answer justice oconnors question i never got one how much money trustee lose result scheme how much owe no joanne how much money trustee lost result scheme say involved fraudulent transfer property by fraud reduction value business why would enter settlement accepting less hes entitled when say bankruptcy fraud mean something different mr sauber i take fraudulent conveyance surely answer yes either mean something different dont but i still dont understand separate claim somewhere conveyed property perhaps medical practice third parties fraud creditors that nothing bankruptcy i take can tell first predicate act rico second date what later predicate acts does suffice rico violation need second predicate act and occur you say cannot pattern without second victim well couldnt pattern inferred multiple predicate acts second victim even entered picture well pattern i thought answer moment ago i would suppose far pattern requirement cause action satisfied anything done damage medical partner yes yes two predicate acts insofar concerned filing bankruptcy petition second transfer assets medical practice thats enough establish pattern well well lets suppose think enough story another doctor well fine complete time bankruptcy petition filed transfer made plus mailings calls forth im looking record discloses whats alleged enough alleged apparently establish claimed injury series acts would qualify pattern you included facts complaint laid in fact complaint went 130some pages youve got plenty place that chooses proceed she filed complaint year november 93 and claimed injury claimed rico cause action decide among things i guess statute limitations begins run anything agree messy case do agree least elements rico claim exist statute run that means injury pattern but injury occurred well lets take point i problem brief saying terrible problem we first predicate act injury second predicate act well i kept asking rico injury theres second predicate act time injury occurs yes fact may well pattern already there filing bankruptcy petition fraudulent intent alleges transfer assets thats second thing so already see pattern and whether understands cause action correctly something court said doesnt matter you dont understand medical malpractice law statute start run if knows acts acts add cause action okay start statute running she doesnt understand she doesnt understand would considered part pattern then seems go back say i thought say justice oconnor suggestion welltaken there pattern pattern second victim came picture thats said and i think youve got choose pattern view accept justice oconnors suggestion suggestion i guess seems youre even favorable rule but thats dispositive agree but seems boil justice oconnor suggesting moment ago she simply didnt recognize fast enough youre saying happened short time it grew domestic dispute if pattern seems law got require plaintiff nimble enough see so i think i agree i complicated scheme sell brooklyn bridge youd wise you wouldnt buy five six others might buy now suppose instead one person buying it turns five putting money is suddenly rico violation i mean rico violation activity hurt five people rather one why create pattern i dont understand pattern words whats causing problem i dont understand seven complicated acts lead sale brooklyn bridge comprise two predicates i dont understand dont fact three people buy brooklyn bridge rather one makes difference rico purposes so youre saying i think answer justice breyer sell bridge twice sell five people thats becomes clear is did sell bridge twice in 170 pages despite detail complaint longer antitrust complaint ive seen including complex i still couldnt find detail facts that facts lead sale brooklyn bridge twice well say pattern i understand it simply conveyance property less fair value i mean thats one act i mean happened there lot wasnt vincent paid continuing salary much earned there continued operation new enterprise put money pocket had this went now case law least establish pattern very well mr sauber mr lacovara but could assume without wasnt she could say even pattern didnt exist later date still complaint timely knew known injured yes may i interrupt youre assuming answer something opponent thinks need decide youre assuming person cant rico cause action based injury statute violated youre assuming plaintiff may rico cause action based injury occurred statute violated but add version that discovery second thing occurs whichever comes later no youre still saying im suggesting youre assuming rico cause action violation occurs thats rule friend arguing way hes arguing injury rule thank mr sauber the case submitted,1332.0,1787,34,thank mr chief justice may please court in order understand district court court appeals properly dismissed claim basis statute limitations may important mention four possible statute limitations rules briefs frame three i think colloquy learned friend would show judgment must affirmed also important go back find case actually pled district court court appeals in court seems transformed lost debt bankruptcy case that emphatically reason alleged district court indeed bankruptcy court 1989 led claim petitioner ms siragusa actually incurred substantial measurable injury 1987 let refer i may joint appendix lets start first bankruptcy adversary complaint date thats may 1989 time district court court appeals found adequate notice rico claim may 1989 4 years filed bankruptcy rico case although theres discussion denying existence pattern suggesting may one two predicate acts may 1989 ms siragusa filed adversary complaint among things lists in bankruptcy court yes mr chief justice its effect civil claim way related jurisdiction bankruptcy court its claim may made either trustee third party may made outsider debtor third parties well also case mr chief justice request personal remedy individuals indeed individuals bankruptcy case included respondents court today lawyer defendants in may 1989 ms siragusa claimed called fraudulent course conduct look page beginning page 191 joint appendix beginning paragraph 21 uses defined term the debtor beginning 1983 never intended make marital payments undertook fraudulent deceptive course conduct paragraph continues defendants ultimately joined she goes refer justice kennedy justice breyers question filed may 1989 no ill get moment mr chief justice she goes beginning paragraph 33 allege beginning least 19 july 1987 approximately 2 years complaint filed series fraudulent misstatements mail wire made vincent made alleges counsel heart institute entities thats patricia brown respondent ultimately firm affiliated beckley singleton firm paragraph 33 continue subparagraph b c d youll see references heart institutes counsel saying next thing then go page 198 joint appendix she says debtor filed certain schedules january 1988 taking unbelievable position she attributes heart institute counsel thats respondent patricia brown she says paragraph i 99 schedules prepared respondent purportedly described certain transactions the point several points justice oconnor the key point pattern existed point alleged time several years allegedly fraudulent activity wire fraud mail fraud fraudulent bankruptcy petition the bankruptcy petition filed 1987 yes thats next point get she alleges complaint specifically injured incurred financial damage result scheme now scheme alleges important well exactly scheme district court court appeals understood alleged rico case it fraudulent discharge debt she alleged bankruptcy complaint 1989 exactly alleged rico complaint november 1993 object scheme nature injury fraudulent transfer security interest husbands interest medical practice yes i think judge hall left open question whether petitioner would prevail injurypluspattern recognition point our argument today however colloquy several justices indicated even rule thats third fourth briefs frame case dismissed petitioner thats correct thats correct i want say well i speak respondent we opposed certiorari justice ginsburg i say court appears taken certiorari decide existence real conflict correct accrual rule civil rico claims there three rules think clearly bar complaint the fourth one fourth one thats third circuits last predicate act rule one would save the one think even petitioner brief seems recognize would clearly command affirmance think correct rule pure clayton act accrual rule well ninth circuit since ninth circuit law quite clear sufficient argue petitioners rico complaint barred ninth circuits injury discovery principle court i take issue right rule lay civil rico claims whether one adopted well i think way injury rule defined either actual imputed constructive injury the first rule i dont want get lost discussion the first rule one think correct clayton act accrual rule petitioner acknowledges injury knowledge discovery element exactly even actual knowledge yes justice oconnor argument specifically rejected implication argument specifically rejected agency holding v malleyduff court said proper statute limitations civil rico cases fraud statute even happens fraud predicate thats invoked particular case congress fashioned civil rico section specifically borrowed pattern section 4 clayton act court held therefore borrow section 4 clayton act statute limitations reason i say that make easy case dispose settled since 1919 including court zenith v hazeltine petitioner acknowledges brief discovery principle clayton act section 4 civil damage cases thats tolling doctrine and concede principle accrual tolling theres active concealment designed mislead potential claimant believing claim i dont think thats necessarily necessary assumption statute what congress done say may possible look predicate acts taking place far apart 10year period determine whether pattern racketeering but hj case court unanimously agreed pattern requirement requires relationship among predicate acts threat continuing criminal activity unlikely predicate act year one predicate act year 10 would show sufficient continuity give rise pattern but point justice scalia relates whether civil rico claim arises i dont think really bearing claim viewed accruing purposes statute limitations well thats conceivable i would suggest ground disposition applies consider correct rule clayton act discovery principle even ninth circuits discovery injury principle would academic moot even though plaintiff petitioner would also lose pattern discovery principle knew may 1989 according allegations yearsworth mail frauds wire frauds leading fraudulent thats debatable question i think justice breyer raised question whether injury must take place pattern i would think that issue isnt squarely framed injury alleges i would like cite passages describes injuries 1989 indeed 1987 i think correct interpretation statute justice scalia would rico claim accrue must pattern racketeering injury predicate act occurred otherwise would hard reconcile language i would agree discovery point under one rules sorry no i think discussion i justice scalia would rico injury unless rico pattern well there something consistent there something said may way congress defined statute time injury first person injury result arson necessarily result rico may yet but thats case well odd position justice oconnor for last 8 9 years petitioner working several different court systems claiming injured sizeable degree virtue fraudulent transfer interest medical practice violation right foreclose lien complaint dismissed federal courts state court bankruptcy court says oh way i havent injured yet right fact injury wont mature bankruptcy case well know next millennium its still im sorry there revocation discharge right so thats correct joanne creditor yes shown theres bank anything no that shown record attached summary dismissal summary judgment papers case opinion february 1993 bankruptcy judge recommending withdrawal reference adversary complaint recites recommending that complaint dismissed joanne time creditors paid joanne remaining creditor thats correct i may go outside record this judicially noticeable bankruptcy court dismissed trustees claims theory namely shes creditor he cannot maintain prepetition claim fraud allegation vincent whose shoes trustee stands active participant fraud therefore barred suing anybody else vincents stead but i may yes sir oh im perfectly prepared say right 1989 purposes litigation she i didnt on basis complaint filed civil rico complaint lets turn alleges 1993 various kinds losses injuries injuries said incurred 1987 fraudulent transfers defeated security interest lien property nevada law prevented foreclosing business realizing later claimed 6 million worth profits would able earn shed allowed foreclose 1987 the tangible injury alleged complaint i refer page 47 joint appendix page 70 joint appendix itemizes losses suffered siragusa medical practice interest scheme  says losses currently exceeding currently 1993 exceeding 6 million failure receive marital payment thats 13 million judgment obtained vincent september 1987 impairment ability execute foreclose siragusas medical practice result alleged fraudulent transfer 1987 so alleged civil rico claim pattern racketeering detailed justice breyer five exhibits attached prolix complaint thing claims dozens maybe hundreds acts wire fraud mail fraud said lost property tangible amount 1987 we suggested respondents briefs the latest theory case presented court really bankruptcy discharge case challenge fraudulent conveyance fraudulent reduction i see 14 million verdict but since time original litigation began record shows attached appendix beckley singleton respondents brief petitioner received approximately 19 million result settlement dr bowers result redefined alimony award replace discharged marital payment 200000 vincent paid 1994 settled case now petitioner says maybe shes entitled maybe claim interest i think would hard say without knowing whether interest running original 13 million judgment 1987 rate look least made whole but point the case law far lower courts court never addressed treble damage trebling takes place damage award jury renders therefore victim financial case made whole trial theres nothing treble trebling doesnt arise air it arises calculation verdict made whole lower court cases suggest basis rico trebling but point i would make posture case court basis possibly treating either moot recognizing isnt claim opening brief main brief merits court order sidestep statute limitations problems injuries complaining injuries took place 1987 petitioner argues injury occurred yet wont know bankruptcy case closed next millennium bring rico case based divorce case she said vincent eventually denied discharge reasons joannes debt owed vincent survive full unaffected bankruptcy proceedings mainly alleged bankruptcy fraud quote page 16 17 moment injury definition final discharge defendants legal obligation pay debt the rico injury may occur unless discharge granted and brother i agree 1994 judge riegle bankruptcy judge granted stipulation vincents consented revoking discharge basis petitioners claim court recharacterizing bankruptcy fraud lost debt case isnt injury never in either event affirmance dismissal rule 46 moot would seem appropriate now brother said well i think justice ginsburg case perspective alive enough decide right accrual rule conceivably i think well i would view almost inconceivable least theoretical possibility court might decide third circuit correct case last predicate act rule would kept claim alive civil rico purposes court authority decide issue granted cert namely four rules that i think thats correct thats youd that correct certainly respondents standpoint wed happy disposition i think right one justice stevens clayton act accrual rule in malley duff court held congress patterned civil damage remedy rico clayton act its clear 80 years clayton act rule discovery principle its worked quite well no section 4 dates back im sorry but court zenith cites cases district court cases going back 1919 civil remedy 1914 forward section 4 thats right construed running time injury without regard discovery i saying arguable rico violation rico injury until rico pattern injury following predicate act at point but colloquy justice breyer i conceded thats necessarily correct construction statute certainly one thats academic petitioners pleading ample predicate acts well fraudulent transfer defeat security interest well ill take hj it agreed upon unanimously i know justice scalia characteristically pungent concurrence still frustrating nevertheless said court done best could congress handiwork it certainly doesnt mean multiple schemes necessary it certainly doesnt mean justice souters opinion court emphasized multiple victims so whole lot different criminal acts mail fraud wire fraud bankruptcy fraud directed defeating injuring joanne siragusas property interest would i think clear constitute pattern ever one alleging last 7 8 9 years injury took place result culmination pattern even acts continued affected may affected persons dr heeren if questions ill submit,418.0,626,16,this adversary complaint and strictly speaking adversary complaint bankruptcy and seeking sort remedy assets bankrupt and youre reading adversary complaint bankruptcy not complaint present action what paragraph i thought said 33 i see so point reading was injury mr lacovara may i ask clarify as i understood ninth circuits opinion judge halls opinion said theres statute limitations question circuits position 10 years injury whether know pattern other circuits injury plus pattern if ninth circuit rule complaint would timely said rule injury period am i wrong understanding thats judge hall said but thats something ninth circuit dealt the ninth circuit said rule contrast rule circuits simply injury doesnt matter didnt know point pattern and youre telling us seems like isnt right case us decide question but i thought debate parties third circuit rule injury injurypluspattern rules well theres another aspect rule do look whether plaintiff knew known injury andor pattern look whether actual knowledge no shouldhaveknown component and yet circumstances fraud element courts fairly often applied shouldhaveknown thing rico often involves claims turn fraud what fraudulent concealment is fraudulent yes mr lacovara troubles applying clayton act rule clayton act provision like rico refers predicate acts last occurred within 10 years commission prior act racketeering activity i theres problem seems reconciling sudden death knowledge injury rule obvious expectation statute would long lapse time 10 years predicate acts basis suit but point tell us this academic case whether apply rule injury injury plus pattern complaint untimely take view say well havent got real case deal since either rule would lead judgment under proposed rule pattern existence injury occurred order injury start statute running well otherwise strange statute allows 10 years know two predicate acts you could first predicate act injury occurs immediately 4 years go statute run second predicate act occurs still within 10 years and would cause action rico time first injury and rule would 4 years time discovery commission second predicate act whichever occurs later no well i didnt say i didnt say discovery i said rule would i take it would 4 years injury right commission second predicate act whichever occurs later i dont see need that say couldnt person burns somebodys house part plan burn three peoples houses occur 5 years later couldnt person whose house burned begin recover i mean would seem odd congress wouldnt want recover and rule would allow person 4 years time injury time second house burns would i think rule of course theres claim theres theres claim theres injury fact theres evidence petitioner joanne better ever and bankruptcy case fact there final discharge and theres final distribution and creditors remaining she one remaining well follow may i sure get one little follow night follows day shes beneficiary shes injured neither trustee injured mr lacovara aside inconsistency saying know 9 years shes injured shes injured right 9 years laughter now im prepared say i mean obligation do case controversy us case proper us entertain im asking and subsequent events rendered alleged damages nonexistent notably elimination discharge well mr sauber said shes entitled several thousand youre disputing maybe right may wrong theres controversy well rico claim valid i guess treble damages would order how dismissal improvidently granted thought case squarely presenting split circuits one hand injury rule the injurypluspattern rule well wed decide whether fourth rule youd still leave three rattling around so point view dismissal improvidently granted couldnt pick three something objection i take but go ahead decide three think best it hasnt clear 80 years section 4 wasnt enacted till 1950s the statute limitations part wasnt enacted yes construing state statutes limitations i thought conceded would modify clayton act rule degree say injury occurred second predicate act until right okay depending pattern thank mr lacovara mr sauber 4 minutes

question presented whether iowas search incident citation statute shall adopted court new category per se reasonable searches it march 19 well iowa supreme court construed language says otherwise lawful search extend search incident excuse search incident arrest exception encompass circumstances citation issued fact yes yes say thats correct your honor in march 1996 mr knowles pulled speeding newton iowa in respects routine traffic encounter mr knowles obedient single deterrent pull he produced valid drivers license a computer check revealed warrants arrest police officer testified suspicion we didnt raise question lawfulness arrest were questioning lawfulness subsequent search if i answered way justice oconnors question i misspoke the statute says otherwise lawful search the iowa supreme court held search lawful at stage proceeding district court iowa supreme court court contested validity arrest excuse stop case authority arrest circumstances traffic citation yes thats correct your honor the officer testified suspicion mr knowles carrying contraband weapon items concealed person car at point satisfied issued citation mr knowles handed mr knowles signed at point officer radioed backup searched mr knowles person automobile he found small quantity marijuana officer called pot pipe at suppression hearing officer testified justification search excuse consent conduct search he relying entirely iowas search incident citation law the supreme court deciding mr knowles appeal essentially held search incident arrest doctrine united states v robinson held per se reasonable search doctrine going extended state iowa virtue statute situations citation issued the fundamental premise iowa supreme courts decision search incident arrest doctrine require custodial arrest it merely requires grounds arrest cause arrest this premise incorrect the search incident arrest doctrine historical legitimacy it existed common law country england always thought involve search incident arrest necessary assumed reasonable search there comparable historical roots historical legitimacy search incident citation search incident means criminal prosecution would commenced outside arrest also the actual the actual stop would arrest no that would a seizure brief detention court held seizure but order effectuate arrest officer would essentially handcuff person take police station an arrest all arrested persons handcuffed yes if necessary suspicion he could conducted terry patdown well recently minnesota v dickerson court reaffirmed requirement terry articulable basis believe person armed dangerous no i dont believe simply speeding yes thats correct if done would valid search incident lawful arrest yes distinction that well your honor arrest iowa differ terms seriousness offense an arrest placing somebody custody state the state exercises dominion body arrested purposes commencing prosecution public offense it necessarily entails going jail booked jail post bond that i understand i didnt mean i meant say officer says youre arrest would commence arrest process that entire arrest that would begin arrest process you arrest the officer would take control person then rest procedure would thats correct your honor i think bumpers v north carolina would legitimate reason questioning voluntariness consent would be acquiescence claim lawful authority police officer i would question well i think would would simply issue whether consent would would valid i think consent coerced threats lawful things well unlawful things and i think basically the holding bumpers v north carolina i would like answer question quoting united states v robinson 414 us 234 note 5 i quote the danger police officer flows fact arrest attendant proximity stress uncertainty grounds arrest and i would elaborate traffic citation common occurrence country in iowa alone average 400000plus year citizens great fear theyre pulled traffic violation they know brief encounter they know soon free go they know receive summons they go court contest elect pay fine plead guilty this provocative encounter whereas arrest presents unique threats officers safety the person may items car if uncovered might go prison long period time including life and going extreme danger trying bring person control lot lose brought control yes thats correct justice scalia i aware common law means prosecute criminal offense commence prosecution criminal offense outside arrest but i also believe proliferation lot minor misdemeanor offenses country citation came vogue reasonable manner to prosecute criminal offense i i know common law distinguished a simple seizure person arrest i think lot the common law history im aware referred united states v robinson court indicated common law authority historical sources respect scarce and court we didnt thats correct i believe later court clarified decision berkemer said officer told individual arrest inception particular encounter court would considered arrest oh i dont know clarification i dont im going venture guess theres another reason searches incident arrest differ searches incident citation lot fourth amendment areas larger intrusion subsume smaller intrusion speak lesser included intrusions and person taken custody arrest lot rights lost lot things done would intrusive violation fourth amendment subsumed greater intrusion longer case in situation citation issued law physical intrusion sort court ever found allows lesser included well the right make greater intrusion purposes fourth amendment hypothetical situation no arrest made key point case terms fourth amendment i conceded arrest could made made traffic offense arrest wasnt made a citation issued because i would refer united states whren v united states fourth amendment concerned actual events events could happened normally would happened its sort reverse argument made whren there defendants tried rely fact normally police vice officers would made arrest therefore beneficiaries hypothetical situation the side coin state allowed beneficiary intrusion lesser lesser included smaller intrusions fact never occurred i dont believe specific examples brought briefing iowa supreme court every traffic offense iowa arrestable offense therefore every traffic offense iowa somebody cited basis full search person vehicle no but traffic citations produce need look evidence but i would like say citation would necessarily involve evidence need look evidence particular search could governed carroll decision simply officer probable cause believe offense occurred probable cause may evidence car and search could justified existing doctrine but typical traffic offense involve evidence officer acquired already thats correct but offenses no those arrestable offenses the iowa yes wow because iowa supreme court recently yes and thats laughter this law applies municipal offenses iowa supreme court held recently state v yes absolutely searches would justified existing reasonableness reasonable searches court carroll i would think know offense would likely involve possession recently stolen property no no i say laughter thats correct and that would citation give rise justification yes well probable cause would needed arrest search generally traffic citation supply the justification arrest right im aware its theoretical position if questions id like reserve remaining time rebuttal thank thank your honor i would like make comments ms chambers mentioned officer suspected mr knowles drugs the officer although may suspected testified suppression hearing cause suspicion mr knowles drugs occasion appendix the second response id like make regarding enforcement statute although statute passed 1983 wasnt 1990 thereafter iowa supreme court gave construction anybody idea meant and hasnt enforced much lot county attorneys advising police officers rely sole basis search pending belief may overturned and finally response justice ginsburgs question citizens iowa putting 400000 citizens iowa year get traffic tickets if policy uniformly nondiscriminatorily enforced right arrest would ended the legislature would end i confidence this policy enforced statute enforced selectively otherwise would politically stood citizens iowa fact one dangers statute like thank much ill waive additional time the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,837.0,1102,39,well hear argument next no 977597 patrick knowles v iowa mr rosenberg im sure thats statute the statute says i believe issuance citation lieu arrest lieu continued custody affect officers authority conduct otherwise lawful search so i took issue whether lawful search whether statute said fullblown search i thought left subsequent determination whether search lawful now case iowa court said full search lawful course seemed rely least part federal law fourth amendment well i thought court say full search occasion traffic citation lawful view isnt happened yes it isnt statute requires result they said kind search lawful so i guess decide whether federal constitution thats correct mr rosenberg could back minute answer justice oconnor said something i didnt understand challenged that i didnt understand contested authority make full custodial arrest speeding you contested dont merely give citation cant search but i hadnt realized raised question justice stewart left gustafson case whether could constitutionally full arrest traffic violation where raise question well answer justice oconnor right asked contesting authority make full custodial arrest basis traffic violation said but i understood were making limited challenge assuming could make full custodial arrest didnt all issue citation having done citation cannot engage in full search arrest make full custodial make full search so talking dont exercise authority authority youre challenging merely issue citation nonetheless go ahead so thats talking do think its clear stop traffic offense committed officers presence arrest is clear is person free leave handcuffs required well would agree officer made valid stop exercised the option which understood i think clearly require driver get car officer point could least have gone to point terry kind patdown search do concede no hes well assume valid stop traffic violation assume ordered person car driver standing right front could have conducted terry patdown without okay that would regardless suspicion caused appearance person bulge waist something like thats i dont understand response justice souter i dont think mere fact person speeding creates articulable reason search person then answer different shouldnt shouldnt said basis terry patdown well youve conceded could arrested iowa law takes said handcuffs going station is necessary suppose officer said im placing arrest said words searched driver passenger inside car suppose said youre arrest conducted search so whole thing turns whether officer says youre youre arrest heres ticket then happened handcuffs station im trying determine constitutes arrest iowa law takes words youre arrest different case go quite an involved procedure effect arrest well youre giving different answer one gave i asked enough officer says youre arrest this officer says youre arrest he searches car finds whatever found small bit marijuana pipe brings person already told youre arrest station house your basic argument as i understand justification full search arrest take person custody said in robinson facts present simply issue citation suppose police officer said look im entitled arrest take station im going im going give citation let search car well officer right take custody couldnt give choice mr rosenberg you pointed historically distinction seems recognized searches incident arrest consequences mere citation why what arrest assuming valid arrest made justifies search doesnt justify noncustodial situation of course thats one justifications would express the one obtain obtain necessary evidence isnt isnt another justification thats alluded besides protecting the officer i mean hes arresting somebody outside car able search inside car just keep guy outside car he search inside car case arrest obtain necessary evidence could i ask your researches common law common law draw distinction youve called custodial arrest noncustodial arrest would common law considered the stop car arrest i mean policeman telling go if go know violation the law i use force stop is would common law consider arrest i think mistook question i guess im really asking whether common law seizures person considered arrests is clear two categories seizures person one know temporary traffic stop another one call full custodial arrest well thats case then didnt long history of allowing searches sort connection arrest could long history allowing searches connection traffic stop whether give citation well i guess didnt lot cars trucks back 1600s 1700s laughter if move forward common law cases decided court berkemer mccarty cite brief i guess proposition traffic stop arrest that clarification i assume that justice powells argument in robinson im sure i understand right make greater intrusion isnt right make lesser argument i understand said youve arrested search kind de minimis i mean theres nothing much left object body subject custody and thats true but i dont know whether really goes issue right make greater intrusion isnt right make lesser intrusion no maybe i misunderstand i thought conceded arrest could made it would lawful arrest no question the right commit greater intrusion arrest assumed doesnt follow right commit lesser intrusion mere search mr rosenberg made rather graphic comparisons in briefing others say every citation trigger a full custodial search jaywalker danger person whos walking dog without leash i mean examples brought iowa supreme court say every citation every petty offense yield search turn something nothing offense because limit iowa i understand everything every traffic violation dont signal arrested do count driving influence traffic offense because seems officer might reason akin given robinson wanting search evidence seems also speeding offense complete sense car brought stop youre going find anything inside car going help prove person speeding and i understand correctly state law that search whenever issue citation its state law search whenever issue citation instead arresting offense that permits arrest so walking dog failing curb dog examples really would problem iowa law they arrestable failure curb dog theyre tough laughter and goes at least the ability substitute citation arrest goes second degree burglary there i suppose might reason search wouldnt case speeding well would say youre cited second degree burglary arrested right search lets say vehicle vehicle stopped citation issued second degree burglary well lets assume theres no probable cause to believe theres burglary tools fruits crime car could officer incident citation burglary search car without im surprised youre conceding your answer well gives rise one justifications advanced robinson doesnt the need search evidence plus fact i suppose issue citation probable cause got probable cause right moment would include probable cause search vehicle i suppose the need for searching evidence justification chief justice referred would would taken care probable cause presence probable cause if indeed need search evidence probable cause dont rely arrestability offense right and justification talking need keep safe i dont think issue citations burglars anyway do know theyve ever done writing ever give warning laughter very well mr rosenberg ms chambers well hear thank mr rosenberg the case submitted,1082.0,1685,35,mr chief justice may please court in 1983 iowa passed statute allowed officers use citations almost offense at time iowa legislature authorized stated that citation issued officers may still search make otherwise lawful search patrick knowles challenges statute applies search car made issued speeding ticket the concerns raised petitioner case met fact iowa statute requires probable cause arrest every case search made its probable cause arrest makes arrest issuance citation reasonable fourth amendment its probable cause arrest in iowa almost every ordinance it generally yes correct correct could make custodial arrest search incident thereto no it no in iowa clearly could strip search two reasons first iowa specific statute deals 8053 i believe 8043 statute specifically says scheduled traffic violations simple misdemeanors would include ordinance violations no thats second prong answer clearly courts prior decisions context search incident custodial arrests strip search made certain carefully restricted circumstances i cannot conceive could exist context jaywalking or city ordinance violation its probable cause arrest also prevents random suspicionless searches major part petitioners brief case the states position interpreting iowa code section 80514 iowa court simply says statute authorizes whatever fourth amendment authorizes went decide fourth amendment authorize search incident citation so yes we think its certainly issue hasnt decided its states position extension prior opinions searches always require probable cause arrest right its states position must probable cause arrest initiation prosecution manner that believe consistent courts prior opinions in cupp v murphy difference situation although probable cause arrest kind initiation prosecution there charges filed whether custodial arrest citation no prosecution initiated so given particular circumstance court simply said exigencies exist case cupp give rise kinds concerns arise prosecution initiated escape destruction evidence prosecution the state concede point your honor couple reasons first context speeding certainly wouldnt looking kinds broad ranging evidence might look burglary case example but certainly identity always issue case thats its certainly true the person likely produced kind identification right likely two things true your honor if officer cant search officer doubts whether that identification valid person cant produce acceptable identification officer likely make custodial arrest might could search let give example its uncommon officer stop someone particularly iowa dealing rural communities small population stop someone person say i license i simply dont my name bob jones i live 308 elm street the officer may well know that information true feel comfortable writing citation theyre comfortable identification officer can make necessary records checks confirm license valid on hand certainly isnt uncommon suspects misidentify present false ids situation officer doubts identification either issue citation knowing issued right name make custodial arrest and simply well course states second response issue whether theres evidence a speeding case example gustafson robinson court said search reasonable dont look particular case see whether would fact evidence weapons search well certainly one would normally expect search based concern officer safety might made initiation stop i would point couple things correct its states position officers allowed make decision best serves safety in case officer stopped knowles kept car officer wrote citation the officer called backup point backup officer arrived officer issued citation made search so one infer officer kept knowles place could keep least partially observation officer came serve backup made if extend robinson court means apply situation officer subjectively fear suspect state agree characterization i think court noted robinson i think court noted robinson that officer subjective fear defendant certainly right and states position similarly general rule established context we certainly agree although studies say that show officers objectively able accurately predict offenders likely dangerous are statistics indicate traffic offenders pose threat certainly common sense would tell us continuum danger cases offenders less likely dangerous and your honor we make statement really extension robinson gustafson every case officer search iowa statute officer already make custodial arrest there handful states either rule statute judicial decision practice similar iowas in vermont state v greenslit case cited states brief florida issued decision state v mccray 626 s 2d 1017 arkansas state v earl decision 970 sw 2d 789 colorado colorado makes bit distinction dealing statute offense statute specifically prohibited arrest im sorry i misunderstood question all states depending counts varies 25 30 my count came 27 allow virtually every circumstance almost 50 states allow certain circumstances thats normal no actually your honor although statute went effect 1983 practice far routine couple reasons i think one could infer one reasons constitutionality searches were unsettled cautious prosecutors likely advising cautious law enforcement officials exercise great deal care area well certainly one would expect prior belton probably auto searches that doctrine prior decision case certainly officers exercising caution but secondly thats second ground i think officers exercise great deal discretion and careful use its certainly one two well certainly law currently allows custodial arrest search every situation unquestionably constitutional conceded by knowles officers currently searching cases would would behave presumably similarly search incident citation the fact officers exercise discretion certainly doesnt defeat rule the rule presumes reasonable fourth amendment concerns preservation error officer safety officers subjectively choose go limits power state believes thats proper exercise discretion well course custodial arrest miranda would made officer wished interrogate so necessarily true would given every case but question allow officers search without providing protections provided arrest course answer yes however but taking back practical example officer knowles case could already made custodial arrest searched unless officer wished interrogate mr knowles would required give miranda similarly officer could arrest iowa law search subsequently release person citation fact the practice advocated american bar association american law institute all circumstances functionally identical point view suspect it practical matter matters little suspect whether officer utters words youre arrest searches releases for reasons although recognize that one could see skirting miranda example really functional manner it certainly that would we certainly concede latter that would true fact iowa law officers arrest search subsequently release citation because promptly release citation those practical limits might might arise dont yes and fact form would use well thats thats certainly one take of course states position that releasing citation allows officer to things finds necessary confirm identity investigate crime obtain evidence necessary releases suspect minimizing amount detention required again i would point thats position american bar association american law institute fact advocate the position advanced knowles is really one countereffective terms overall protections fourth amendment hes asking court require custodial arrest made case where officer wishes search protect safety preserve evidence but certainly would would meet needs preserve evidence yes situations officer could search terry certainly again identity also might speeding is probably lowest end continuum certainly course he he certainly case officer made bones fact suspected drugs he searched drugs found drugs but rule enunciated court apply case analogy to every case yes robinson gustafson court also said fact officer didnt believe would fact find evidence weapon defeat need search search reasonable fourth amendment thats end thats end question officer may search and believe search reasonable couple reasons first ive said every search incident citation iowa requires probable cause initiation prosecution so manner citation so definition officer authority right make arrest in circumstances no they may give warnings yes yes if arrest mean saying youre arrest or certainly yes the state however believe court needs go far deciding whether search could conducted a warning issued the did assume arrest did i hear of course thats case raises i think question pretext right laughter i think i think could i assume defendants would raise issue pretext i think whren likely would answer question i think could your honor again dont think need go far heres i think could i think underlying premise least i read whren officers case followed subsequently stopped car thought would find drugs and issue course pretext and i think i think court getting officer really along wanted search arrest pretextual improper and whren would states position would proper now may good public policy may raise concerns but wouldnt answered fourth amendment but thats thats happened case rule state proposing would require initiation prosecution either citation custodial arrest leaving another day hypothetical posed court there argument made may good one probable cause arrest alone would enough state recognized courts concerns robinson gustafson cases the scope search immediate need search related custody equivalent custody so reason reason proposing rule would require initiation prosecution strong belief prosecution initiated whether thats custodial arrest issuance citation concerns officer safety preservation error arise it could happen let remind court could also happen custodial arrest yes equivalent arresting saying eh dont really want proceed prosecution were dismissing charge we believe like citizenry would upset custodial arrest made every case would also upset if right search abused well were certainly advocating that happen certainly encouraging given hypothetical think could conceivably happen and reasons arrest followed dismissal charges wouldnt violate fourth amendment likely would but let go back to question posed by court would would citizenry become upset certainly custodial arrest abused likely legislative process would lead curbs offenses custodial arrests could made similarly if officers abuse right search incident citation legislature curb authority believe that would happen abuse occurred think happen that essence thats right currently dont always exercise custodial arrest but could used discriminatory abusive manner one theres evidence thats happening iowa since 1983 secondly unless violates fourth amendment kind discriminatory abusive police procedure objectionable they might certainly case person arrested white man born newton evidence abused but course abused certainly would something state would advocate if abused legislative process police regulations certainly advice counsel ways kinds abuses curbed and certainly used discriminatory manner equal protection clause provides remedy court noted whren id like point couple things one things knowles proposal would require court frequently get issue officers subjective intent examination court rejected time time time time recently whren the reason wed get some examples posed court dealt officer made decision search would open question happens officer makes search doesnt issue citation later makes custodial arrest subsequently do determine whether officer intended arrest search made do determine decision made those kinds subjective evaluations nearly impossible it would course require court set rule arrest would required cases rather less intrusive alternative issuing citation,672.0,1086,27,may i sure agree opponent said scope citation this includes something like jaywalking and therefore because could arrest jaywalking and therefore somebody jaywalks police could search and would include strip search i mean youre arrested could subject strip search a strip search jaywalking but argument would constitutional objection strip search traffic citation do acknowledge rule youre asking us confirm today iowa opinion extension previous cases well well extension prior cases well cupp v murphy certainly didnt speak terms broad right conduct searches even presence probable cause well theres reason expect evidence produced virtue search traffic violation really how say point decision made issue citation i mean point individual presumably produced drivers license whatever identification if isnt officer isnt going let go citation well would officer let go a citation didnt identification surely he wouldnt know write citation well i think youre i dont know whether thats im small town laughter and i im ready i think concede example much real world example assuming assuming wouldnt make sense us simply say order keep kind constitutional categories constitutional protections intact say case better officer make custodial arrest justify search basis consider broadening scope socalled search incident exception include a citation for kind misdemeanor traffic violation even wouldnt make sense say look thats problem go ahead arrest know stand okay goes back another one justifications robinson one evidentiary justification referred one weve already heard morning justification protecting officer fact making good arrest that made i dont see apply i understand facts point decision cite announced effect end encounter the officer says im going arrest im going give citation instead the fear police safety i would suppose minimum case whereas maximum arrest made so why isnt robinson but its i mean talking i presume talking case weve got isnt search encounter to point issuing citation officer says way im going search car well infer officer always intended make search relying state law realized might well want extra protection searching car but sort begs question the officer protection justification robinson justification protecting officer individual in arrest custody following arrest and definition dont so seems whether argument ultimately prevails would certainly extend robinson order see way i going go ahead well thats robinson said going establish general rules okay but way you would going beyond robinson youre saying theres authority search would basis set forth robinson when traffic stop youre going find additional evidence speeding searching either person car safety situation is simply great issue citation formal arrest and officer power iowa law obviate least part danger making custodial arrest how many states policy like iowas i i havent able uncover perhaps arkansas are states say traffic offenses subject full custodial arrest im asking many like iowa frankly startled to think that police officer could make full custodial arrest pettiest infraction may i ask another question routine procedure police follow is correct normally custodial arrest made officers procedure follow would include rather complete search sure weapons around whereas normally citation situation unless go ahead arrest conduct search in states except iowa but iowas statute books i suppose iowa police routinely making searches situations so if affirm iowa court presumably practice would become much prevalent doesnt also indicate iowa officers consider usual case necessary search order protect officer but youre asking us have rule presumes theres danger officer i suppose thats basis rule but presumption doesnt accord facts even iowa officers understand ms chambers theres another side person whos apprehended fact theres arrest theres warning light go person get miranda warning but argument appealing say greater lesser full arrest citation but part defendant gets traffic ticket doesnt idea thats kind situation faces theres full custodial arrest must given miranda warnings so pretty good situation police it seem enormous amount authority put hands police as said leave judgment police exercise good judgment but thats constitutional checks always sure that police exercise good judgment but lot trouble for suspect officer system arrest somebody and deterrent conducting conducting searches genuinely reason conduct search yes arrest you paperwork police dont like paperwork i gather watching television movies laughter they dont like excuse they arrest search say never mind arrest wow laughter i really arrest i could search ive done search heres citation lets forget thats entirely true i dont think ms chambers i think reasons simply looking person car to feel armed anything i think youd authority search terry without needing rely custodial arrest doctrine and evidence need to search youve stopped person speeding if youd come second burglary might different actually case knew defendant he knew knowles stopped stopped and whren said theres thing pretextual search the fact thought might drugs doesnt counsel reasonableness arrest may i ask statement requires initiation prosecution i know ive stopped officer well gave lecture i warning and sometimes may stop intending initially give citation figure a unusual excuse the speedometer wasnt working something and decide later give warning in iowa stop must give citation they could give warning could give warning initially arresting person yes they could words could arrest search find nothing say well ill give warning they could could could arrest justice stevens hypothetical could arrest search give warning arrest simply pretext search intention time arrest anything giving warning absent finding something could could could officer arrest intention times simply giving warning could arrest simply order effect search well one said right lot well its pretext its its instance officers objective actions really are disclose true purpose i dont understand would require you say would require initiation prosecution officer would authority make arrest guy speeding he makes search says i dont think i want write ticket ill give warning what would prevent yes i know say that would thats rule propose seems adopted rule propose would nothing prevent officer conducting searches wants simply giving warnings whenever finds nothing going ahead prosecution whenever finds something that could happen rule there point point ms chambers made response and said yes maybe good citizens iowa would little upset get arrested every time forget signal theyre turning well you usual rule search incident arrest you want turn around arrest incident search and seems thats abuse authority if officer arrests intending really arrest thats abuse authority youre really proposing could happen but answer officers going use judgment theyre going use power think well im sure fellow doesnt look little bit suspicious he little nasty conversation i mean could authority without using every case or better yet might save outofstate motorists laughter but arrest objective thing thank ms chambers mr rosenberg 2 minutes

petitioner versus cale j holder united states district judge southern district indiana mr smith may proceed argument every defendant unwilling every defendant unwilling how  case differ i understand complicated pleadings several parties crossclaims  difference basically case ordinary case plaintiff sued defendant asked medical examination defendant i know facts complicated ultimately difference application rule 35 now difference inaudible contract carriers court problems  especially inaudible stage game court  accounted believe greyhound corporation the original – voice overlap – situation bad times later counter claim national lead filed kind inaudible written files but moment question one defendant demolition rule south dakota now petition type rule says  ill read inaudible but national lead included bus driver crossclaim part  and filed application examination but filed filed cross action and alleged bus driver negligent inaudible contract carriers alleged mentally incompetent so whats point frankly im sorry i see – i dont  party national lead hes party original plaintiffs point party contract carriers you mean joint issue there issue joined matter mental physical health well tell mr smith least national lead crossclaim answer kind filed behalf  and allegation  vision bad in national lead how   theres answer file well greyhound filed also greyhound name they filed i understand cross action national lead contract carriers and course bus driver agent –  possibly judgment inaudible caused representing also right i say lawyer represented bus driver representing bus company  mr smith  position rule applicable except party joined issue party matter mental physical health – well i know i  i confused brother clark im quite clear i thought telling us position rule applicable except instance party examination sought joined issue party issue mental physical health right and point schlagenhauf whatever name joined issue anyone on matter mental  but i dont understand made party  i cant find pleading  national lead it must alleged something bad vision something well i dont  i dont understand didnt enough opportunity answer allegation why would well lets assume had opportunity  denied bad eyesight court ordered examination would rule 35  well would sustain action 35 well i know i realize good cause probably another point line somewhere would eliminate present argument if schlagenhauf denied  denied court court ordered examination point would wash and think  really substantial question and know – would deny  or would admit lets assume  mo  complaint filed alleged schlagenhauf bad eyesight you say opportunity answer now would  idea would happen whether deny affirm well  well happens application premise rule 35 this thing he  said would  said would except gives another point cause i guess point good cause notice there course question invasion privacy i wouldnt go time i afraid i used  court questions i reserve  inaudible that line hold practices filing interrogative defendants whether method whats done suit filed places you inaudible along plaintiff filed interrogatively defendant asking questions he doesnt give notice get issue he wants get evidence try issue form whats difference or  would objection opportunity began ask questions examine wouldnt file motion set aside why didnt but i  i wasnt assuming original decision but sealed  right file interrogatory plaintiff tried right file defendant   theres issue drawn files interrogatories interrogate  but havent made effort going court you didnt go back court say look didnt notice want cancel reverse get set aside draw file objection you immediately took position theres no right issue drawn why didnt  didnt   and yet amounted anything didnt present judge what but could  could bound i believe do judges do i understand fact petitioner filed answer national lead crossclaim denying allegation crossclaim accident due defective vision whatever allegation now would well whats left well i  i understand argument  thats say powered make order case i put you answered denied allegation crossclaim premise upon orders issue namely good cause missed now  ground well mean prove negligence in words examinations submitted issue damages is anything wording rule would justify distinction well how would support do make  still would make point nine examinations instead four washed case but issue remaining actually theres practical issue remaining far nine rather four examinations there four  so order modified well set appendix brought certified judge directing us file  to prove negligence thats youre really saying prove negligence you would problem getting examination plaintiff contributory negligence youre drawing distinction i understand whether issue one negligence whether relief question physical mental examination party and one inaudible judgment motion incorporates letter  judge site pretrial conference that conference instructed certain things he never advancing judge alleging  page 21 said schlagenhauf mentally  inaudible its page 40 the defendant greyhound corporation carry thing employed driver expecting  operate said bus public highway although says like inaudible hes mentally physically capable operating said bus sort tallies time place said accident occurred which fact known known grade that motion motion refers letter refers claim mental incompetence the motion starts page 7 refers i understand judge able take notice fact alleged mentally incompetence party inaudible i beg pardon time thank gentlemen,1650.0,1971,14,mr chief justice – – may please court at outset i would like behalf respondent make one correction this order filed february petition filed february 5th it laid upon dockets court period 15 days local rules required order file anything opposition laid one day longer district judge entered order upon february 21st the trans  transcript case shows served united states mail pursuant federal rules put mails never transactions including circuit court appeals suggestion i heard petition properly filed notice made laid upon court records thats correct and transcript shows male service  record sir point never made circuit court appeals its never mentioned brief its mentioned transcript i say court matter lie 21 days  16 days action taken required local rules 15day period order opposition objection filed thereto im speaking petitioner contract carriers to national lead also joined  well filed petition  identical times set certain voice overlap serve  then record shows inaudible that correct sir also filing filing action crossclaim now i would like point federal rules they useful discovery areas place lot emphasis really dealing noticepleading and dealing codepleading suggested this rule say physical mental condition issue says controversy i say federal rules even forms applied plaintiff files suit two codefendants said “you negligent” suffices from point discovery procedures resorted order get facts now always possible codefendant situation prove discover would enable side codefendant solely negligent neglect but later particular district courts requirement purposes instruction  letter part indicating mental phy – physical condition petitioner placed issue contributory negligence allegation special answer later  mr justice goldberg practice this particular judge pretrial instructs parties spelled specific acts negligence spell indicate whether common law statutory violations letter compliance order pretrial conference thats correct sir right sir yes sir thats correct sir thats sequence there formal formal hearing anytime petition affidavit discovery procedures discovered driver schlagenhauf greyhound similar accident flat rock michigan previously it also pointed day tragic accident another observer similarly positioned schlagenhauf highway see lights trailer half mile three quarters evidence discovery time part affidavit schlagenhauf admitted saw lights 10 15 seconds although fourlane highway two lanes made effort deviate move position so judge without opposition filed local rules within 15day period laid upon record sir well sir field sort thing visual problems in addition even people operate vehicles become terrifically aggressive theyre vehicle theres car there instances people known situations even suicidal impacts now factors including visual cant find function disturbances proper area psychiatry theres reason wouldnt examine man eyesight viewpoints time may find underlying psychiatric problems could lead difficult court dealing common carrier i would like point anomaly on page 36 i think petitioners brief point would sufficed taken medical reports interstate commerce commission upon man schlagenhauf used court now irrespective question evidence whether could isnt interesting approach man willing submit physical examinations administrative tribunal court insist becomes issue inviolability person now constitute  no sir i think affidavits filed similar accidents hes driving vehicle common carrier type people saw thing didnt see 10 15 seconds intervening that sort cause shown  oppose come within 15day period lay table type contrary affidavit type contrary information i say sir good cause shown district court respondent absolutely proper exercising discretion given rule becoming increasingly useful complex society people wheel airplane throttle fast moving equipment explanations accidents also uncovered reasonable physical examination now i say course district court cannot automatically must firing line cause field theres good justifiable cause order grant order i think replete seen seventh circuit court appeals considering question to extent sir i think correct whether motive busy judge signed order made selection point still remains seventh circuit decision rendered stay order lifted matter represented crowd judge reduced orders four so stand court we‘re dealing order four physical examinations nine subject circuit court appeals matter moot still say unless court render decision vacuum would  recognition new development case since ord  extraordinary writ mandate sought dealing multiple examinations four shopping i know many many instances plaintiffs submit cases upon medical evidence involves doctors treating doctors experts addition thereto defense counting four five doctors testifying medical condition individual i believe thats appropriate conclusion sir inaudible oh yes i think pleadings filed i know instance opportunity  file appropriate pleadings national leads counterclaim inaudible well theres fi  theres answers filed cases issues closed inaudible yes im sure inaudible this case actually set pleadings trial district court state proceeding  inaudible well theres certainly  case it might filed subsequently the clerk refused print anything record circuit court appeal now i  i know matter – issues closed i supposed clerk proper district judge order attorney file court bring proceedings date now issues closed i  i think possible that closed time matter went circuit court appeals but since but i dont consider  the  mr justice black i dont think exception seeking physical examination defendant part rule doesnt confine  plaintiffs seeking personal injury says party the real doesnt confine one seeks federal orbit forum the rationale suggested petitioner one seeks forum therefore waves constitutional right well know right highly qualified its absolute sense whatsoever no i know none rationale plaintiff filing action seeking personal injury complaint therefore issue upon complaint even limited notice form court would still require statement sir there case knowledge thats unique  uniqueness case court  exhibit defendant thats correct  whole area discovery someone talks substantive rights involved really seeking truth discovery methods impact ultimately substantive rights but difference make whether defendant put position asked questions indicts facts deposition procedure whether hes subjected physical examinations find explanation one tragic accidents unusual occurrence men physical disability incapacity sort another find serious accidents involving trucks air craft various methods modern transportation and suggestions made petitioner would take us back pre botsford days these rules terrific utility brought  sir well many instances perhaps  no sir this  first instance explored first instance used paternity suit district columbia there first instance used warrant arrest policy there  theres first instance rules many examples plaintiff seeking personal injuries rule expanded utilities expanded i think day modern transportation upgrading whole situations recognition definite fact areas hot conditions many physical factors explanations many tragic accidents unusual one this accident resulting demands well excess 2 million young boy maimed life serious riding common carrier common carrier two similar accidents driver sort now suggestions made court constitutional questions involved and course sibbach put rest opinion constitutional questions now precise  it  it said  rule 35 procedural origins it therefore consistent enabling act rule reported court congress without change deviation process i would say that attacked constitutional grounds  even mr justice frankfurter dissent reasoning said theres question theres constitutional question still within power still procedural subsidy  still consistent whole scheme things discovery procedures mr chief justice i think frankness court example busy judge submitted prepared order custom nine named doctors could make selection instead making selection required number inadvertence signed order norm but that would explanation matter i dont think would ever occurred within 15day period petitioner made steps agree busy trial judges keep calendars frequently confronted situations matter appear court completely corrected and i think important situation court never indulged moot questions never indulged thinking vacuum  mr chief justice argue argued also behalf respondent dont know mind we dont know mind also argued could motivated well exercise discretion putting schlagenhaufs models one basket want way gave multiple examinations would possible question virtually board doctors reach conclusion true condition man asked submit one doctor might say asked submit specialties would question afterwards disaster situation so extent sir argued circuit court circuit court appeals seventh circuit took position discretionary matter within corners court would appeal court invade discretion court  basis record trial court extraordinary writ mandate stated court time time issued district court virtually nullifying rule excess exercise power beyond intention rule im sorry time im sure i inaudible the logic argument  i want insist upon one point trial judge must certain facts affidavit form form would justify conclusions now i dont think say every negligence case codefendant defendant going subjected psychiatric mental examination mr justice goldberg thats logic position put question we  multiple examinations ive said recognized rule start drawing line going two going five ive pointed experience i frequently found plaintiffs serious cases six doctors five doctors testifying now i see area medical specialty specialization multiple examinations appropriate cases answer and pursued theyre plaintiff theres reason world shouldnt pursued defendant subjected sort discovery procedure order  i know were unearthing truth truth courtroom and suggestion inviolability person case theres qualified right begin false – i suppose boy girl today go get license wedding marriage subjected requirement administratively blood test would prefer test qualified right you might say well dont get married they refuse get married point society rights qualified theres reason right shouldnt cut ways order us get backs prior trial pretrial find frequently could what could cause tragic accident would happened end suppose man submitted hasnt done wed find theres nothing wrong physically mentally hes inconvenienced yes supposed find serious physical disability accounts two accidents mental disturbances accounts two accidents i say miscarriage justice averted truth sustained spirit federal rule this writ seeking all writs act mandate court expunge record mandate expand record disorder yes i think impliedly throughout argument petitioner suggested  fact nine chief justice suggested nine requested  oh four requested  nine actually granted that indication abuse discretion that  sir he  sir argument presented court morning i get implication i deal areas constitutionality i think long ago foreclosed courts decision i think would sad day went back pre botsford day like  language clear operation rule clear i would think would ive said sad day us strike discovery im sure wouldnt also create lot problems areas without  without power must theory theres constitutional innovation court never knowledge ever suggested constitutional problems involved whatsoever  prove negligence well thats rule know again areas many things rules reported the dinsel  dinsel case thats file indicates one court felt inherent power court take driver codefendant  defendant subject physical examination either even though rule didnt apply now thats one instance i think  inaudible no sir proposal made court permit agent named party physically examined named party would court far advisory committee concerned impression i get court took position occur point inaudible well i invisibly that one i say knowledge great many cases area but court wanted say plaintiff pursues personal injury rule could easily said wanted say anyone pursues  pardon sir yes yes mr justice black thats exactly argued argued petitioner theyve even gone far say rationale pursue remedy federal forum subject waiver theory now point suppose defendant removes matter federal court selected forum subject plaintiff now  pardon as i view brief theyre merely saying defendant sub  subject examination unless circumstances brought federal orbit forum consent waiver theory go back botsford language use botsford language inviolability person bring courtroom later date years know dealing absolute sense rights modern society all rights modified common good one the power clearly  power subject far defendant concerned clearly and court narrowed stand moment interfere discretion district court theory nine four examinations i see thats case narrowed no i dont think i  i meant i say inviolability person certainly modern society hammer respective rights absolute sense particularly deal right isnt qualified common good society now doesnt mean court virtually edict  thing growing five centuries assertion common law five centuries wigmore brings clear back days emphasis upon property this rule developed i believe ive exceeded time i apologize we point process discovery many cases disposed without trial truth upon  table see cases tried  federal courts would congested many instances would impossible thats useful discovery thank sir,383.0,374,11,mr kightlinger inaudible and youre speaking petitioner contract carrier  not national lead well also joined petition and records shows inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible the district judge didnt exercised  apparently exercised little discretion granting didnt even read petition  read understandingly granted good deal asked didnt he granted nine examinations instead four so youre suggesting i suppose effect us chain circumstances different case case originally granted certiorari besides thinking  investigation far sibbach versus wilson say in reflection made physically examination defendant judgment court plaintiff subjected put examination  and theres denied right examine plaintiff personal injuries something material case ground forum pleading issues pending know i dont  do know inaudible  examination sought prove negligence rather injury that court present time this difference inaudible well thats along line not along line have ever used rules get physical examination  get physical examination party prove negligent i think constitutional inaudible well mr kightlinger prompted judge provide nine physicians examine man even parties asked four we might agree  mootness issue advantage become material you  must argue  argue entitled point nine judges court appeals court appeals sustained beg pardon inaudible and still wouldnt views discretion judge requires nine examinations man instead one thats right im  im sure i completely understand mandamus isnt now heres ground if one grounds  ground void many examinations going i didnt understand issue now another thing could correct though i thought claiming power now another question  going back physical examinations  as defendant though cannot plaintiff objective examination i assume thats arguable is argued hes defendant immune kind inquiry   made examination plaintiff is argued also i thought inaudible if one arguments im sure say says examine find physical defect like absence arm absence vision see examine see mental defect mike motor disaster effect is one argument i hope case doesnt

amendment interest side of argument case i mean suggest interest less significant interest individuals banding together make expenditures might otherwise able make and i think even party context court recognized distinction colorado republican cases held limitations the party spend support candidate subject limitation there valid limitations party contribute candidate choosing now contrast rather minimal first amendment interests interfered section 441b plays important role safeguarding integrity election process this court in national right work committee already recognized corporate contributions pose risk reality appearance corruption broad prophylactic limitation corporations including without great financial resources appropriate response threat all corporations regardless size also pose risks circumvention undermining workability candidate disclosure requirements as court recognized cedric kushner promotions king whole point corporation basic purpose fundamental reason for existing create legal separateness individuals form run corporation artificial corporate entity giving artificial entity right contribute name independent individuals underlie corporation obviously poses distinct risk campaign finance system based largely individual contribution limits section 441b addresses risk requiring contributions made segregated fund subject enhanced bookkeeping disclosure requirements those bookkeeping disclosure requirements turn make campaign disclosure forms individual candidates file work meaningful fashion if candidate disclosure forms simply revealed candidate received money artificial entity either ambiguous name court citizens against rent control v berkeley termed seductive name tends conceal true identity true source funds campaign finance forms disclosure forms provide meaningful information if hand 441b makes underlying corporations use segregated fund discloses individual sources contributions disclosure forms work meaningful fashion i think bears emphasis court recognized massachusetts citizens life distinction contributions expenditures applies full force context nonprofit organizations a limitation expenditures prevent organizations members might otherwise resources reach certain audience pool resources together reach audience there comparable function benefit pooling individual candidate contributions the individual candidates perform pooling function assembling together candidate contributions whatever size order reach audience engage political speech the intermediate pooling function nonprofit corporation serves benefit either circumventing individual contribution requirements assembling aggregate contribution sufficient size potentially capture attention candidate purposes quid pro quo to sure provisions campaign finance laws allow corporations assemble funds in aggregate amounts segregated fund additional safeguards imposed including enhanced disclosure requirements congress adopting section 441b drew important distinction corporations ability contribute individuals in expenditure context limitations corporate expenditures stand stark contrast general right individuals engage unlimited independent expenditures but one right engage unlimited corporate unlimited contributions candidates congress addresses threat individual contributions dollar amounts it addresses distinct risks corporate contributions requirement segregated fund higher limits enhanced disclosure requirements respondents effectively ask court disregard second guess congress decision treat corporations differently individuals purposes candidate contributions with respect i think essentially respondents ask court treat north carolina right certainly chief justice rehnquist the main difference context segregated fund all incoming contributions segregated fund disbursements must disclosed pacs i mean pacs generally segregated funds particular context corporations labor unions the donor listed there specific provisions small donations name goes fec publicly disclosed but theres really everything comes comes segregated fund traceable either fec public disclosure requirements in context corporation generally only donations given 200 express purpose of political activity disclosed and create significant loophole in justice oconnor really isnt least case comes court the prohibitions corporate contributions law since 1907 left completely unaffected bipartisan campaign finance reform act it true certain limitations electioneering activity new term introduced law bipartisan campaign finance reform act apply corporations so considering challenges mccainfeingold legislation court may consider restrictions corporations engaged expenditures new electioneering activities the issue corporate contributions miraculously unaffected many reforms put place bipartisan campaign reform act laughter in end a political action committee segregated fund give 5000 there indeed justice breyer its 5000 and two points emphasis question one respondents dont right set segregated fund theyve actually already done theyve already set segregated fund and i know court massachusetts citizens life emphasized unique restrictions burdens setting segregated fund i think thats true context expenditures but i think easy exaggerate burdens imposed setting segregated fund although segregated fund like pac theres requirement separate offices separate officers they distinct leadership and leadership corporation i dont know particular limit on members but point thats really required segregation funds keeping separate its onerous requirement and i think accident four cases court involved nonprofit corporation national right work committee massachusetts citizens life austin michigan chamber commerce case four nonprofits already set segregated funds case got court so i dont think least contribution context onerous requirements there this court footnote 8 suggested that wasnt dispositive reasoning other entities could set position similar massachusetts citizens life might able afford burdens but massachusetts citizens i dont want suggest may true risks slightly less context nonprofit advocacy corporation context something like general motors but i think particular context candidate contributions corporations court repeatedly decided willing accept broad prophylactic approach limit corporate contributions including contributions corporations without great financial resources the court said much national right work committee it repeated national conservative political action committee i think tellingly said massachusetts citizens life and particular look footnote 13 massachusetts citizens life decision court specifically said understood massachusetts citizens life would continue subjected national right work committee regime purposes contributions talking fact didnt massachusetts citizens life example didnt shareholders but quick to reinforce that didnt mean didnt members purposes national right work committee could solicit subject course overall limit could give direct contributions candidates well i dont think necessarily holding case obviously case involved expenditures but i think court distinguishes prior precedent court thats part opinion lower court free ignore i think part opinion critical reasoning court given stare decisis effect and i dont think theres reason thats brought bear revisit courts distinction massachusetts citizens life contributions expenditures fundamental building block courts campaign finance jurisprudence i would think many respects thats important part opinion its say court cant subsequently revisit part opinion i mean thats certainly court i think purposes lower court anyway if court distinguishes two cases ground prior case involved corporation less 10000 subsequent case comes along theres 9999 involved i would think lower court would well served heed distinction court drew and i think particular context obviously court free reconsider prior precedents i dont think theres reason the distinction contributions expenditures proved workable particularly context nonprofit corporations as i say isnt abstract application contributionexpenditure dichotomy court never considered massachusetts citizens life involved nonprofit corporation court pains pretty much every step courts reasoning distinguish contributions expenditures in end i think respondents ask court effectively disregard congress decision treat corporate contributions distinctly individual contributions they effectively ask court treat north carolina right life incorporated incorporated theres reason disregard either respondents decision incorporate congress decision subject corporations regime segregated funds distinct disclosure requirements higher limits fact contributions if questions ill reserve rest time rebuttal thank mr chief justice may please court let begin distinction respondents rely limits contributions prohibitions contributions even something distinction i rather doubt reasons unearthed justice stevens colloquy with counsel respondent even valid distinction case involve absolute prohibition this court massachusetts citizens life austin fact much earlier pipefitters made clear limitations corporate labor union contributions section 441b quote absolute prohibition rather limitation contributions the availability segregated funds make contributions another way making limitation particular limitation designed unique risks artificial entities like corporations labor unions and i think effort distinguish discussion massachusetts citizens life distinguished distinctions contributions expenditures grounds prohibition might different doesnt work massachusetts citizens life national right work committee involved provision section 441b so whatever might case absolute prohibition somebodys right make contributions 441b either isnt isnt in constitutionally relevant way courts decisions massachusetts citizens life national right work committee some discussion fine distinctions potentially could drawn american association retired persons national right work committee massachusetts citizens life north carolina citizens right life the point section 441b contribution context congress found need draw kind fine distinctions mcfl course drew distinctions contribution context expenditure context rather drew distinction contributions light inherently greater risk corruption contributions another suggestion made perhaps seemingly less restrictive alternative as independent expenditures made nonprofit associations perhaps contributions made association purpose used contributions candidates could disclosed no contrary this court held it apply least restrictive alternative analysis national right work committee in california medical association case plurality court fact affirmatively held least restrictive alternative required context contributions so i dont think requirement but i want address the supposed less restrictive alternative precisely i believe less restrictive alternative illusory suggestion that individuals could say could disclose give contribution nonprofit organization purpose contribution well thats going effect avoiding circumvention rationale i wonder whether people really going volunteer information contribution nonprofit purpose and additionally even permissible way would enforceable real political world really doesnt give much different result congress specifically provided segregated fund and indeed segregated fund actually responsive kind first amendment associational interests underlie courts concerns buckley even going back naacp button the concern disclosure requirements imposed organizations could backhanded way get membership lists the segregated fund prevents keeping membership lists organization separate political activity organization indeed congress hadnt provided segregated funds requirement corporations simply made available i would think many nonprofit corporations would avail option precisely avoid interference associational interests cases like naacp button the last point id like talk simply idea underlies much respondents arguments threat expenditures types corporations therefore threat type corporations engaging corporate contributions if analysis applied across board would undermine entirety courts campaign finance jurisprudence based fundamental recognition contributions involve greater risks expenditures and expenditures therefore largely unregulated presumably pose great risk contributions if questions id like court reversed,176.0,245,13,well hear argument no 02403 federal election commission v christine beaumont mr clement mr clement government does challenge exemption notforprofit corporation expenditure limitations do think decision massachusetts massachusetts case nrwc would right make independent expenditures why attenuated first amendment right isnt right enables formation political parties people forming together order collectively give money particular candidates well may well but i i wouldnt shrug inconsequential importance individuals able band together support individual candidates thats whole basis our party system can summarize briefly enhanced disclosure requirements youre talking pacs right and donor listed mr clement this section 441b related affected way mccainfeingold legislation but least issue case unaffected what limitation pac how much contribute say senator this youre saying particular kind organization cant contribute directly could set call segregated fund i thinking pac and segregated fund wants make contribution senator smith reelection campaign limit much give id think 5000 i mean could two members well in massachusetts citizens life separate pac but court say type type corporation commercial corporation burdensome unnecessary risk corruption kind corporation significantly less commercial corporations and would apply well if the evil corruption im buying candidate dollars risk less advocacy organization is isnt that assumption case you dont dont dont assert holding case you think whenever distinguish prior case one opinions that distinguishing stare decisis effect very well mr clement mr bopp well hear have actually held mr clement regulating contributions government must find least restrictive means thank mr clement the case submitted,1024.0,1187,24,mr chief justice may please court expressive associations play vital role democratic republic because attract financial support due political ideas prowess economic marketplace participation political process poses threat corruption long serve conduit business corporation contributions well thats classic quid pro quo corruption dealt contribution limits well controversy court on whether the decisions court mass citizens austin accordance constitution cases court distinguished types corruption entailed corporate form potential unfair employment wealth political purposes this applies economic corporations that mass citizens north carolina right life formed advance political ideas yes and thats right size organization issue the issue courts jurisprudence whether nature organization corporate form per se if nature i dont believe your honor i think well the court mass citizens established criteria determine whether organization corporation benefitted mcfl exemption and include whether incentives disassociate lack incentives disassociate instance insurance plans benefits membership economically related secondly would look amount corporate business corporation contributions business activities if much insignificant in comparison total sums raised would qualify thats correct your honor and circuits considered four circuits agree features explained and characterizing mass citizens in supreme courts decision constitutional requirements descriptions organization and agreed that notforprofit ideological corporations still qualify for massachusetts citizens exemption i think mixture political nonpolitical purposes therefore like austin the michigan chamber commerce austin mixture political nonpolitical purposes therefore qualify mcfl exemption and complete answer yes there also incentives economic nature would cause people reluctant disassociate michigan chamber commerce it proved disagreed political ideas advancement political ideas and four circuits considered question amount business corporation contributions said long insignificant comparison total revenue organization still serve conduit business corporation contributions still qualify exemption well true contribution limits notforprofit corporations however intent donor circumvent limits would contributing notforprofit would highly inefficient ineffective way political activities notforprofit corporations major purpose test would cause organization become pac political activity became major purpose internal revenue services limitations activities 501c4 organizations regulations require qualified in order quality mcfl exemption all mean small percentage contribution notforprofit corporation could ever used political activity furthermore contributing notforprofit versus pac a political party also unfavorable prospect donor i mean notforprofit 441a contribution limits limited 2000 contribution pac give 5000 political parties give much furthermore money pacs political parties receive hard money accounts used political activity whereas ive mentioned notforprofits really small percentage order continue qualify mcfl exemption continue deemed pac for purposes federal election campaign act now disclosure interest there contributions readily narrowly tailored way dealt simply requiring contribution notforprofit used intended used contributions candidates must reported and thereby subject aggregate contribution limits this much narrowly tailored way deal disclosure aggregate contribution limits prohibiting organization completely making contribution laughter well theyre pac well theyre theyre pac give 5000 out 10000 posit if theyre notforprofit corporation give i agree agreed yes well the desire subjecting aggregate contribution limit contribution excess 2000 one direct one another source dealt two ways one contribution made group posit earmarked contribution considered contribution group also candidate so earmarked contribution subject 2000 limit contribution used would violation act currently that current law and prospect prohibited appropriately secondly federal election campaign act previously required anyone contributing organization pac contributes money independent expenditure that contribution must reported group independent expenditure congress could require thing they could require money given generally earmarked generally candidates reported the group thereby subject aggregate contribution limits that would also true they yes the internal revenue service would treat organization described political organization thats exactly that would effect i said yes yes yes much less restrictive well court held mass citizens austin pac requirements administrative including record keeping appointment treasurer filing regular reports et cetera limits imposed upon pacs theres 5000 contribution limit pacs et cetera impose constitutionally burden burden constitutionally exercised rights did pass constitutional muster so true pac imposes unconstitutional burden first amendment activities and course goes back know justification in words prohibited source well theres onepage report there organizations independent expenditures pacs theres one onepage report file and report would say much spent independent expenditure much donated organization purpose independent expenditure similarly report like could filed contributions could capture people trying circumvent limits to make undisclosed excessive contributions we would capture choice left donor would completely undifferentiated unearmarked contribution going used organization 95 98 percent purposes lobbying education charitable activity well asking distinguish massachusetts citizens life type but issue case whether organization viewed prohibited source of making independent expenditures making contributions case yes yes court clear mass citizens corporate form per se potential unfair deployment wealth political purposes held types organizations pose threat threat whatsoever well but well we believe holding court mass citizens organization serves potential corruption democratic process essential court hold independent independent expenditures would allowed yes but in right work wasnt prohibition contributions it a limit amount contributions and agree limits amounts yes your honor thats correct thats said but the case involve neither mass citizens right work involved limit amount contributions like 2000 limit we challenged only prohibition that court buckley reaffirmed shrink said speech association aspects making contribution that far speech concerned general expression support found undifferentiated act contributing well prohibited contributing they cannot organizations cannot give one cent therefore thats yes prohibition thats correct speech aspects association aspects contributing remain limits amounts imposed speech aspect general expression support association aspect serve affiliate person candidate you name the method contribution affiliated candidate when zero contribution limit speech association allowed act contributing therefore well is generally correct characterization jurisprudence examine why contributions subject lower level scrutiny and the is speech association aspects giving smaller contribution remain cant give contribution speech association aspect yes yes well cumbersome constitutionally unconstitutional burden court held mass citizens austin require first amendment political activity done pac so yes and im aware im asking court to consider not apply dicta mass citizens since involve contributions to apply consider rationale and north in national right work court considering prohibition soliciting contributions members pac considering limit considered member so case involved contribution limits prohibition well theres valid reasons unlike representation argument government people want pool resources association that valid reasons fact people already contribute pacs political well that true many people choose pool resources want group separate existence political purpose unlike individual know identified particular point view political idea like group would like like naral would so choose pool resources group order make much powerful statement political ideas attempting support want candidates associated now addition fact group aggregate small contributions make large contribution particular candidate enhances the contribution individual would otherwise made made done group aggregate so justifiable reasons people want associate and association no amount limitations you mean the amount yes well goes source the rights first amendment rights implicated amount limitation opposed prohibition well potentially would case decided point and court upheld 5000 limit instance political action committees and would consider got low i mean theres certainly potential contributions low justices breyer ginsburg explained shrink certainly potential theyre low unconstitutional but talking challenged the 2000 limit we accept we dont accept proposition organization poses threat corruption political process completely prohibited making contribution so view source limitation amount limitation result the contribution jurisprudence court accepted greater regulation contributions applicable if questions thank you,630.0,863,14,i i dont understand if i bribe somebody senator out political motivation im environmentalist whatever thats corruption its i economic motive corruption well i mean i may well i dont see distinction whether economic actor political actor anything whether theres corruption well immense corporation formed advance political ideas i i dont one happens small one attract enough people immense organization whats organization american association retired persons i mean thats immense organization with large amount available money well mr bopp would say aarp referred justice scalia national right work committee involved opinion massachusetts citizens life boat why mr bopp point i thought massachusetts citizens life went it said policy accepting corporate contributions one difference organization massachusetts citizens life they said would take money corporations you accept money corporations you get little business corporations dont policy turning away well would call aarp ideological organization ill bet members also get benefits and criterion would would make different but could serve conduit large donor wealthy person wants avoid personal limitations much individual could give what i understand saying the one justifications advanced restriction contributions ive interpreted following we five people these five people write check candidate smith 2000 they get annoyed they think able give 4000 law forbids so form committee nonprofit corporation called 4000 smith corporation and writes another check 2000 gives corporation corporation gives smith and i think government says well congress wanted stop its actually going limit zero theyre going limited 5000 group provided jump certain hoops all right now whats whats wrong argument i know see im saying im saying congress doesnt want groups called 4000 smith group even call something different they want limit members 2000 and thats though variety reasons directly relevant question theyve allowed people get together jump various hoops called pac hoops give 5000 extra so congress wanted might say none all right now thats thats basically argument i want get straight know direct reply all right so mr bopp isnt also case the corporation justice breyer posits would qualify as 501 exempt organization thing using money make contributions political candidates im trying it relatively insignificant part overall activity so five people would to get together maybe 100000 people their little portion watered significant part corporations business i didnt think numerical limit and question tried eliminate extraneous points i think understood perfectly well i mean 503c corporation et cetera but i want go back answer the im trying get clear and youre saying congress could take group whatever else to qualify could take group youre saying congress could say well limit corporation give money five people insofar havent met 2000 individual limit and moreover could require reporting know all right now less restrictive alternative congress actually done say proceed segregated fund because well go i dont see proposal doesnt administrative inconveniences mr bopp court basically decided issue national right work committee case didnt you want us distinguish type nonprofit corporation i think thats hard i mean dealt precise issue case but organization opted corporate form knowing limitations well couldnt holding in massachusetts case talking independent expenditures rather contributions certainly massachusetts case doesnt control outcome mr bopp least three times text courts opinion massachusetts citizens life least three times distinguishes direct contributions candidates expenditures time explains reached result it makes distinction and i think that thats central massachusetts citizens life so if opinion shorn however remember contribution candidate citing back the earlier decision justice oconnor mentioned national right work committee distinguish case seems massachusetts citizens life drawing bright line contributions candidates independent expenditures yes im im talking massachusetts citizens life line justice brennan drew massachusetts citizens life contributions candidates every time talks holding case said remember contributions candidates mr bopp challenge distinction first amendment purposes restricting contributions restricting expenditures so youre youre saying distinction for valid first amendment purposes the contribution limit and expenditure limit distinction strong enough forbid entire prohibition but say i dont think cases sliced onion quite fine get nuances theres difference prohibiting contribution limiting i think distinctions primarily contributions may quite substantially regulated independent expenditures cannot but say cant give overlooking saying pac doesnt count it isnt absolute contribution it it arm create segregated fund 501 501c4 organization you can it rather cumbersome way so isnt cannot make contributions not first amendment activity in massachusetts case i said i dont want repeat except justice brennan repeat least three times mr bopp that first amendment right talk associational interest the ability give least dollar identify candidate really first amendment interest applies association apply members association and mr clement pointed individual members association remain free give dollar indeed 2000 particular candidate all youre really talking is ability individuals identify candidate ability individuals pooling resources help candidate significantly it seems thats interest at issue but among reasons order identify candidate to reach pocket give dollar mr bopp seems argument really would go way amount limitation total prohibition everybody contribute 10 wouldnt would okay say amount limitation low as i understand youre trying draw categorical distinction total prohibition amount limitation and i dont know i dont see argument really directed but seems amount limitation thats very low would vice argument total prohibition thank

distinguishing feature presents review issue whether extent sitting trial justice may participate actual give take negotiations guilty plea invites resolution question specifically left open brady united states consequences would judge deliberately employ sentencing power induce defendant tender guilty plea threatening impose harsh sentence trial harold ramsey petitioner 24 years old took plea he history emotional problems certainly stranger criminal justice system kings county he juvenile delinquent adjudicated youthful offender convicted felony prior involvement law in case charged two separate armed robberies and case made way courts king’s county appeared conference part specially designated kings county exploration possibility disposition without trial in part entered guilty plea reduced charge unarmed robbery upon sentencing promise made judge indeterminate term three half seven years incarceration slightly greater minimum could received new york law subsequently plea case transferred trial part mr ramsey first time encountered judge whose conduct called question it 18 months arrested incarcerated throughout period time mr ramsey afforded pretrial wade hearing one witness called identified petitioner perpetrator armed robbery quite definitely defense tried raise issue propriety pretrial identification techniques however next day next morning prior conclusion hearing defendant mr ramsey offered plead guilty this time charge armed robbery charged indictment one count cover indictments this plea upon sentencing promise offered judge indeterminate term six twelve years incarceration there transcript negotiations led guilty plea custom kings county new york plea negotiations generally conducted bench conferences recorded record learn negotiations happened lead petitioner plead guilty immediately prior sentence petitioner moved paper supported affidavit affidavit defense counsel that correct your honor yes your honor in fact oral argument appellate division district attorney quite candidly conceded type negotiations goes time well i would ask court establish procedural safeguard based upon analysis jackson needless encouragement guilty plea i would think active participation trial judge give take negotiations guilty plea encourages defendant plead guilty and serves state interest therefore needless well i think agreement maybe reached defense counsel prosecutor agreement maybe presented trail judge now argument limited essentially judges scheduled preside trail event disposition reached thats correct i find constitutional objection conference part concept established kings county defendant may invite judicial participation knowing judge negotiating preside trail disposition reached it seems source encouragement plead guilty defendants knowledge rejection plea offer made court judge mean trial held judge may view guilty man rejected fair disposition case i would object presentation federal system agreement presented judge may ratify reject offer the judge must act independently accordance responsibility certainly responsibility ultimately impose sentence independent agreement reached prosecutor defense counsel cannot bind judge may present i find nothing i find course impact presentation judge well first difference comes mind although assume that agreement rejected judge there would personal investment plea bargaining procedure judge there would personal rejection case judge makes specific plea offer defendant rejects the judge apparently presumably would make offer would plea fair sides defendant rejecting offer made court would face possibility judge would resent reject resentment might either intentionally subconsciously work way either sentencing function discretionary ruling would make trial well conference part special part cases sent arraignment established court rule no statute im aware new york there statute rule  it your honor yes and recognized court appeals state judges participate plea negotiations although cases questioned referring aba standards last week amended well seems judge becomes advocate disposition perhaps in case good example prosecutor taken plea negotiating procedure prosecutor prior wade hearing said would consent reduction charge would consent guilty plea unarmed robbery consent needed statute after wade hearing withdrew consent district attorney never took position indicated court would position sentencing so whole question  well particular case circumstances bargaining judge defendant well called  its called prebargaining kings county your honor i must say though many instances prosecutor make sentence recommendation kings county may even condition consent reduction charge upon imposition sentence agreed so extent i dont mean imply cases kings county prosecutor participate i simply say case prosecutor effect participate expect first give withdraw consent reduction plea charge it your honor the proposal cite advanced aba adopted and permits request sides defense counsel defendant prosecutor difficulty reaching agreement may request plea conference judge maybe moderator find difficulties part adopted aba standards indicates judge may independently offer disposition would acceptable thats correct i dont think position moderator would consistent constitutional principles certainly i would objections proposing disposition would acceptable i would add however aba standards adopted last week quite emphatically said judge shall neither word demeanor indicate defendant believes plea ought entered and also says negotiation conference shall conducted record the problem plea bargaining conducted record well seems established prior wade hearing generally discuss fact prosecutor say think prove defense counsel may say well dont  he your honor and case negotiations he could in case seems established uncontested prior wade hearing trial judge apparently unreported bench conference extended defendant plea offer involving unarmed robbery carrying three half seven year sentence petitioner rejected offer insisted innocent requested would permitted go trial what happened witness testified wade hearing crucial part record clearest account happened negotiation following wade hearing given page 28 record court defense counsel engage exchange council speaks followed witnesss testimony and says briefly talk plea guilty time plea guilty discussed plea guilty talked i came bench discussed and your honor said would give six twelve district attorneys approval i came back said client six twelve said went back forth finally arrived decision according judge district attorney withdrawn consent time charge reduction the lawyer agrees goes we arrived six twelveyear sentence prior time admonition statement made guy goes trial convicted going get twelveandahalf twenty five your honor told take back client time i judge i gave warning judge explains says subject course reading probational report practice court armed robbery impose maximum sentence unless mitigating circumstances lawyer replies well i think your honor light everything that basis defendant took plea our position plea record plainly coerce now quarrel proposition stated recently court december corbett new jersey state may indeed offer defendant substantial benefits return guilty plea and learned bordenkircher prosecutor may threaten bring charges justified evidence order induce defendant plead guilty theory prosecutor defense arguably possess equal bargaining power i think that might enter judges sentencing decision but judge  and may give yes might no i challenge i think petitioner respondent part company context case whether proposition state may offer substantial benefits induce persuade defendant plead guilty whether proposition includes trial judge we submit court must draw line trial judge context criminal case cannot count judge representative state his obligation stand state accused ensure accused afforded protections safeguards entitled law we think that role consistent judge judge saying i simultaneously i give sentence six twelve guy convicted trial get twelve half 25 in certain aspects your honor i dont believe within confines statement announced corbett state may offer i think word state statement meant include trial judges i think meant include prosecutors represent state prosecuting body adjudicating body different roles a defendant may faced one hand prosecutor trying persuade give fifth amendment constitutional right plead guilty sixth amendment right go trial also face judge supposed stand prosecutor also face judge attempting persuade i objection procedure i see coercion that may enter  well might enter i think might better practice go another judge i dont think constitutionally mandated event plea agreement reached essential plea presented agreement presented court i find nothing wrong your honor well difference i think judge offers specific disposition becomes advocate risk defendant faces rejection disposition apparently desired judge when prosecutor defense counsel hand agree independently plea bargain must alternative present court judge judge guilty plea may tended judge alternative and require circumstances state federal system mandate case transferred one judge another circumstances made prove i think burdensome would constitute needless encouragement analysis jackson i your honor both i think the defendant expresses interest pleading guilty judge judge likely conclude defendant interested pleading guilty likely guilty fact it would encouragement plead guilty would precisely the difference however ire jackson prohibiting needless encouragement guilty pleads suppression case defendant seeks suppression inculpatory evidence must address suppression motion judge must decide confession fourth amendment question therefore judicial participation circumstance hardly needless essential even though may ultimately work coercive encouraging effect defendant plead guilty well i think i think circumstance i see state interest advanced participation trial judge right county would judicial participation plea there could proposal except i  argument might made i think whoever  thats right i think would whoever propose argument demonstrate need well reasoning based i see underlying principle jackson case constitution  what i think means i think jackson holds encouragement encouragement defendant plead guilty always violative due process test jackson needless whether serves legitimate goal whether goal achieved means and i think case participation trail judge plea bargain serves state interest therefore needless encourages defendant plead guilty therefore needless encouragement barred principle jackson absolutely yes i i think principles jackson prohibited yes jackson course  i think case cite reply brief called i think united states mccoy district circuit court  dc circuit questioned presented precisely judge announces policy impose maximum sentence upon anyone convicted trail armed robbery well course thats closer question course difference lawyer saying client judge reputed policy imposing maximum the difference judge announcing opening court defendant leaving room doubt yes i policy get maximum convicted your honor i agree i think consensus opinion commentaries case whatever benefit may accrue defendants class increase information say outweighed coercive effect judges announcement judges participation plea bargain it  i familiar i think i would trouble the whole concept differential sentencing troublesome its true justice white suggested judge may take account defendants willingness admit guilt take first step road towards rehabilitation announced policy differential sentencing i think would run problem find case i think  which twice  there differing interpretations offered court petitioner respondent it seems respondent suggested footnote brief i point reply sequence events occurred i read record show i may well entitled relief i seek therefore seems tacitly least conceded evidentiary hearing establish interpretation occurred required our position  who trial counselor yes yes your honor well subject reading probation report  i dont believe meaningful since new york every court obliged law every judge obliged law prior imposing sentence least order consider probation report hes obligated  well obviously misrepresented position defendant pleaded guilty armed robbery received less half maximum sentence so really meant anyone convicted court  after guilty thank much it experience  custom  well middle criminal trial certainly issues law raised but  you certainly could i think must  negotiations i think better practice transcribe simply custom kings county i understand recommendation aba i agree thats implication statement core i understand yes course range  yes yes may state announced  yes may i dont think i dont think no cant your honor he may  bargain struck yes may say accepts may give reasons accepting desires no proposition proposition may prior plea agreement well i believe  well let reconsider i think yes i think yes announcement policy causes trouble announcement whether would sentencing may individual case  in proper cases would acceptable sense due process thank you,724.0,881,33,we go order may colleagues arrive and first case 776540 harold ramsey versus new york mr fisher may proceed ready mr fisher continue told us moment ago ordinarily kings county plea negotiations conducted bench conferences record made does apply quite usual judges participate negotiations and position i gather always improper judge  well extent would suggest judge role file a judge sentence man pleads guilty found guilty what prosecutor offers recommend certain sentence defendant pleads guilty defendants says i know judge your recommendation isnt binding prosecutor says well agreeable take judge make feel thinks would say thats unconstitutional whats difference mr fisher state new york brooklyn statute rule bench conference but statute rule says judge shall participate this custom grown and judge party  well side judge negotiation if one parties district attorney position sentence good plea bargaining bargaining is normally understood plea bargaining or trial mr fisher aba standard side footnote page 16 brief fact changed last week wasnt when say aba standard permits mean recommends states federal government anybody else might sentencing authority ought permit judge but would agree judge one board fails going turn case even moderator just pause one another point at conference case discuss facts so judge going trial case  gets prerun case later trial he could get full run could and trial case would new trial well judge sentencing guilty plea normally says announces i think proper get consideration give leniency person pled guilty indicated ready rehabilitation something like yes i understand lawyer may properly advise client least judge usually gives leniency you dont challenge practice yet purposes state action fourteenth amendment judges action every bit action state sense prosecutors isnt i think wouldnt think bargain thats worked prosecutor defense counsel presented kind approval judge may try case what judge says i dont know agree and tried case alright so trial judge turns defendant goes back says something else take back judge agrees well knows judge simply said dont go something better im going try mr fisher rely of course least i understand due process clause fourteenth amendment and contend rule would never permit judge participate bargaining extent least defense counsel said case judge going trial judgei basis submission knowledge part judge defendant guilty rather potential resentment therefore vindictiveness trial judge of course judges time deal rule certain evidence excluded sometimes reasons guilt innocence person probative evidence guilt judge required law fourth amendment rules involuntary confessions whatever exclude trial yet judge knows wouldnt give idea pretty clearly defendant guilty how situation maybe pretty hard brooklyn lawyer realize many parts united states like kings county many many trial judges one trial judge many counties united states one trial judge would longer needless would need wouldnt well one though whole county what  could privilege the way  way might come say well county needless but dont make you used phrase needless guilty pleas im sure i know mean jackson opinion what think means thats im trying get what judge assigned district regularly sitting habits known announces beginning term call criminal calendar persons tied found guilty get maximum sentence permitted statute do think tendency encouragement guilty pleas people make judgment likely found guilty do think bad do think jackson prohibits whether instead announcing particular judge long habits communicates entire bar practicing court thats fact doesnt articulate standard dont think advantages category defendants class versus charge candor judge gives much better working basis making decision mr fisher close 20 years ago 15 years ago court appeals seventh circuit reversed conviction ground statement trail judge chicago practice policy considered always give greater sentences somebody had pleaded guilty found guilty pleaded guilty are familiar decision well i cant remember what would think although least case least according defense counsel active participation bargaining judge precise statement case found guilty nonguilty plea would get maximum sentence there problem case facts actually statement defense counsel the colloquy call attention page 28 appendix most support factual position comes mr bavenzino ph who trial counselor defense there qualified conformation judge but immediately qualifies but said practice court armed robbery give maximum sentence unless mitigating circumstances after notguilty plea why didnt statements negotiations transcribed say never is reason i mean middle criminal trial bar conference sibebar conference isnt transcribed right could well counties i take state announced policy leniency guilty pleas well i mean thats  otherwise guilty plea systems would always unconstitutional i suppose i suppose almost everywhere prosecutors plea bargain  charges that ask almost prosecutor plea bargains says yes say “well give policy recognize leniency extend leniency exchange guilty pleas” what answer  its almost everywhere so may state announced policy leniency guilty pleas the state state yes the prosecutor may judge say i policy extending leniency time sentencing pled guilty you certainly seventh circuit okay well must judged always  may say  i agree i approve bargain struck based leniency so time  must defend position sentencing judge may never leniency guilty plea that isnt i ask may i  i say judge sentencing says “my policy give leniency guilty pleas” thats ever said says almost every time lawyers  constantly tell clients judges policy announced policy give leniency guilty pleas unconstitutional so says says proper cases policy  very well mr mischel he taken long time get mr mischel,1332.0,2075,28,mr chief justice may please court before i respond petitioners arguments regard constitutional propriety judicial participation plea negotiations i would like clear i perceive misconception misrepresentation misconception conference part kings county conference part statutorily mandated provision anywhere new york criminal procedure law however court rules enacted various appellate divisions state new york established separate distinct conference part whereby defendant indicted case sent conference part discussion concerning disposition plea present discussion defense counsel prosecutor necessarily defendant may waive presence judge at time prosecutor presents information regard case defense attorney responds regard defenses matter hed like bring judge at time judge evaluating entire record reading grand jury minutes listening sides advises defense attorney would consider favorable permissible disposition case as counsel pointed negotiations fact negotiations appear record but necessarily detriment plea bargaining system kings county because question certainly defense counsel court may go record spread case understanding plea agreement i suggested brief due process would satisfied trail judge participated  well negotiations everything spread record necessarily preclude require matter negotiations taken stepbystep i see nothing constitutionally wrong situation conclusion discussions prosecutor defense counsel judge spell agreement terms agreement understood certainly circumstances particularly defense counsel may looking towards claim prejudicial conduct coercion would expected indicate believed coercive aspects plea negotiation secondly i would like point raised oral argument petitioners argument suppression hearing markedly different suppression motion must addressed particular judge therefore establishing strict necessity perceives united states versus jackson but easy answer addition prejudicial information brought suppression hearing time judge may suppress evidence conclusively establishes guilt defendant you may also suppression part counterpart plea part kings county what seems saying suppression motion directed particular judge motion must made judge but hand court easily set suppression part trial judge suppression judge hears suppression motions disposition reached the case may sent back trail judge with regard american bar association standards i think interesting note recommend increased participation trial judge matter judge judge may suggest defendant completely unsolicited what would consider favorable disposition but addition american bar association specifically rejected proposal would require disqualification judge motion defendant predicate motion must established judge exposed prejudicial information presentence report even american bar association 1968 recommended judicial participation plea negotiations said judge may disqualified exposed unfavorable presentence report that correct your honor agreement brought attention judge judge says “no i dont want go along agreement go back bargain more” judge aware fact defendant wants plead im sorry your honor that correct your honor  your honor candor typical type plea bargaining horse trading but honor situation judge said defendant well take one three defendant says well zip two he negotiating defendant your honor unclear record record  that correct your honor your honor may i qualify i cant  your honor judge suggest plea taken your honor judge say prosecutions case strong defense weak i therefore recommend  the facts presented wade hearing your honor your honor fact really presented motion maid suppress code identification testimony no your honor there discussion facts case i understand happened case case transferred trail judge this judge going try case he cases going try  well im sorry ive mislead court what happens conference part either disposition  no one judge conference part your honor no your honor either disposition reached called criminal term part 1a if disposition reached judge conference judge assigns cases respective trail parts time motions made defendant  no judge involved ultimate plea negotiations going try case two step process there two judges involved case the first judge conference judge worked plea agreement defendant judge going preside trail three months defendant pleaded guilty consolidated indictment court withdrew plea claiming railroaded coerced case transferred another judge time case called defense counsel approached bench asked judge would objection resurrecting original bargain pardon im sorry your honor the conferencing case terminated the case transferred trail this pretrail hearing the motion suppress  but nothing plea that correct open correct happened case transferred  yes no court stenographer take the wade hearing transcribed but understanding record first case assigned mr justice heldtph point defense counsel approached bench said honor would agree resurrection original plea agreement namely plea robbery second degree term 35 7 at point judge said fine course subject looking probation report district attorney agrees the district attorney agreed defendant – pardon the original agreement conference judge now different trail part he asking resurrect old agreement okay defense counsel went back defendant defendant said i dont want agreement i turned besides im interested i want go trail then made motion suppress identification testimony the identification witness gets upon witness stand goes facts crime identifies defendants perpetrator crime unsolicited says i wouldnt forget mans face 20 years at conclusion hearing thats testimony we assume entire proceeding transcribed petitioner solely doesnt allege witnesses at time next day district attorney witness gotten upon witness stand exposed cross examination exposed prosecutions case now vernacular ups ante says i accept robbery one it practice district attorneys office expect particularly notorious cases it practice district attorneys office kings county never recommend sentence so went unusual certainly unusual county kings the judge knowing district attorney accepted robbery one would robbery one plea required state law it requires concurrence judge district attorney the judge says based i seen certainly legitimate ive seen witness testify i heard say based since practice cases armed robbery cases i impose sentences maximum sentence case would 125 25 years subject course mitigating factors probation report the judge  no your honor i think judge saying is saying defendant im going penalize youre going trail what saying defendant look practice matter sense discretion i find armed robberies kings county particularly dangerous they pose particular danger safety people i decided discretion armed robbery penalized severely criminals danger in short saying go trail i  he would also persuade contrary regard your honor in probation report pardon no pointing honor redeeming factors mans  example participation crime what extent crime was anybody hurt does man prior record does man show signs desire rehabilitation does show remorse commission crime the judge talking defendant time the judge talking attorney understands if attorney didnt convey information honor defendant defendants complain attorney judge the defendant side counsel table this conference judge defense counsel all information conveyed your honor defendant counsel your honor  i certainly personally i would i would suggest court four circumstances possibly three circumstances hearing view would totally unnecessary one circumstance course would court find participation judge whether hed trail justice violated due process assume petitioners facts correct facts say due process violated case or assume facts could correct facts say event due process violated see  what im saying – im asking know making findings facts right im taking language honor case dissented united states ex rel mcgrath v lavallee discrepancy actually transpired prosecution defense judge and dissenting opinion pointed even assume prosecutions case actually states i would still find due process violation the point i making your honor i think petitioners facts borne record that judge said unequivocally take back client doesnt like 6 12 if goes trail convicted im going give 125 25 your honor i would hesitation saying that bold threat impose penalty pardon and would violate constitution regrettably your honor clear record there two interpretations placed transpired we think reason set forth brief page 33 note 28 position persuasive position i concede your honor yes your honor understanding however seriousness particular allegations indeed feel petitioner account correct account due process would violated we nevertheless feel hearing maybe mandated particular circumstance i – authority court its understanding petitioner would burden establishing went that correct we  the participation  i would like classify  that correct would need hearing participation he certainly actively engaged i think distinctions must drawn i think judge says look go trial take plea guilty i offer 6 12 but go trail convicted i afford every consideration i afford every defendant convicted court i sentence according valid exercise sentencing prerogatives i lot difficulty understanding trail judge case becomes adversary prosecutor well your honor santa bella  it promise prosecutor defendant relied upon court refused honor excuse prosecutor reneged promise the prosecutor reneged promise i think clear distinction conduct prosecutor far would permit prosecutor go opposed trail judge for example opinion i dont think judge could threaten kind treatment prosecutor bordenkircher threatened circumstances defendant alternative believe trail judge conduct prosecutor got go court fight evidence prosecutor got fight hostile trial judge but i dont  yes i would your honor i would submit your honor i would difficulty announced policy anybody convicted court would sentenced maximum point taking sentencing requires flexibility  i still think judge circumstances would imposing penalty based factors  i think wrong prior trail judge information given particular case particular facts circumstances  alright then i misunderstood what saying always subject exceptions subject mitigating factors point willing take account fact individual person sentenced  pardon that correct judge im saying fine mr fisher arguing two step process he didnt say convicted subject mitigating factors under mr fishers view facts judge first offered 6 12 defense counsel went back spoke defendant the defendant said i want go trail im pleading guilty finish trail counsel went back bench said your honor doesnt want plea at point according petitioner trail judge said well doesnt like take back convicted im going give 125 25 according petitioner statement practice statement probationary report merely afterthought window dressing brought time sentencing six weeks plea thats i perceive distinction mr fishers facts petitioners facts judge completely disregarding sentencing discretion saying look i give  based i know ill give one sentence if go trial i give another sentence under circumstance your honor i believe penalized asserting rights type case would come mandate jackson but judge says i treat like everybody else you sentenced according valid exercise sentencing prerogative defendant penalized going trail yes your honor your honor brady vs united states mr justice brennan pointed specifically opinion parker vs north carolina one big considerations jackson case death penalty corbett handed i assumed that probably primary motivating factor reading corbett my understanding law statutory scheme setup automatically subjects individual penalty  doesnt mean get automatically subjection penalty would available pleaded guilty would come jackson violate due process in words statute would say defendant armed robbery cases get 15 years pleads guilty automatically gets 7 years i would difficulty situation in corbett your honor defendant whether pleaded non vogue went trail subject type penalty pleaded nonvogue trial  that correct your honor  my understanding corbett your honor i maybe mistaken was went trail jury found guilty murder first degree got definite sentence if pleaded non vult could found facts he could point could also subject penalty the judge could penalize thing discrimination discrepancy two situations in fact jackson opinion pointed jury could find guilty penalize  i would retreat i think trial judge  if i may articulate i think trial judge take step back its certainly question trial judge going impose sentence secret number two trial judge imposed sentence defendant pleads guilty definitely cases would lenient sentence the state certainly encouraged either trial judge prosecutor legislature encourage taking pleas offering substantial benefits but i think judge announces trial without considering facts circumstances case without knowing anything  i understand i think difference legislature your honor trial judge succinctly pointed mr justice brennan parker v north carolina footnote 8 said distinction human distinction statute rigidly implied judge approached evidence bearing overreaching appear record i think judge goes record says im going to under certain circumstances construed threat a statue neutral across board type application the judge hand  may rulings petitioner points personality influence conduct trial may well i would hesitate say made say may readily apparent record trial im sorry your honor could your honor seemed come bordenkicher i still maintain definite distinction prosecutors threat recommend sentence judges threat impose sentence  that correct your honor threatening impose sentence based nothing defendants assertion rights go trial i think point defendant assume trail judge become fact prosecutor longer attached neutral magistrate heard much yes your honor yes im your honor now i would suggest american bar association considering constitutional ramifications certainly would suggest practices advocate would also run counter constitution my problem sentencing particular case judge without regard factors fact individual  your honor i understand correct addition proposals american bar association standards certainly would required states state would able adopt system contract i think system kings county fully comports due process,491.0,737,31,but may  exposed may participate moderator one bargainers isnt correct as i understand go back one gone judge in case wasnt going back forth judge judge held whole thing he didnt negotiate  but got   well i understand prosecutor said practically nothing but least record judge the judge participated merits case is right wrong no sir did judge participate merits prosecution mans alleged crime did ask facts did ask fact im talking im talking theory judge   well judge going try case so current theory cases going try well conference part well cant remarked every judge conference part and tries case well i get understand case judge going try case was trail one conference thing was trail conference business where judge sitting bench trail case pretrail hearing held open court in open court and court stenographer they didnt take this wade hearing right that conference judge like french civil law youre guilty youre prove innocent it also says might persuade contrary you said said unless kind circumstance yeah well – well another sentence he crazy i dont know would say nice armed robbery bad the defendant wasnt what think need find happened he thought worried but would like hearing find happened not assumed fact we difficulty assuming you said assuming facts  is said now son let tell son like father son i didnt think i thought little reaching and unconstitutional is fair say mr mischel i expect i think i know answer going since told us clear record part record appendix what happened case you think concede that clear well isnt burden proof case comes court state court seek upset criminal convection petitioner person seeks upset action state court under authority court well doesnt petitioner burden right court establishing correctness contention order establish principle proceeding unconstitutional well mr mischel told us i think record clearly show participation part trial judge plea bargaining told us didnt some and told us i unless i misunderstood misheard petitioners counsel correct constitutional claim due process clause fourteenth amendment prohibits participation trail judge plea bargaining lose how case fit santa bella case im sure know attempt promise to prosecute but trail judge cant bring another indictment either bordenkircher involved you puzzled something said said assuming facts unfavorable version facts point view would kind acknowledge due process violation well case assume different one chief justice posed little ago trial judge announces policy always impose maximum is equally bad supposing judge says practice  say 20 year maximum says practice case kind gets 17 years well supposing always take one step chief justice said earlier and doesnt every draft case man gets three years every tax evasion case two years bar know whats difference judge saying policy i think ill follow anybody ought know course exception strong mitigating circumstance how differentiate and isnt better defendant really know judge intends but says practice always subject exceptions exceptional cases which i think says  isnt judge didnt judge do think distinction jackson inaudible do think might one rule case jackson relating specter death sentence would necessary apply concept matter two three years less what corbett situation corbett but went trail way could found guilty way hed get lesser sentences statute stated so flat rule go trail certain penalty he could less i understand so trail judge says well look got trail isnt statute if got trial going get x thats i always armed robbery i always give 30 years thats way i but plead guilty i may give less i could give 30 years i may give less said unconstitutional thats difference  ive said corbett 30 years isnt statute which one going retreat you dont need answer right well legislature would announced trials certain crimes mandatory penalty what prosecutor says go trial recommendation trial judge always 30 years guilty what prosecutor says go trail armed robbery found guilty i always recommend 30 years without exception but im certainly willing plea bargain want he power impose just minute friend referred timetotime american bar association reports cover area several might rather sweeping concessions seem made  i wonder aware everyone reports american bar pointedly said addressing constitutional question nearly

Wilson,Richard Seiter et al.,5.0,4.0,0,975.0,1346,7,mr chief justice may please court this case involves holding lower court eighth amendment allow relief directed continuing conditions prison confinement unless individual defendants case acted persistent malicious cruelty maintaining conditions confinement to affirm lower courts decision case would mean conditions confinement nations prisons could fall beneath standard decency without redress federal courts the truly terrible conditions gave rise cases hutto v finney would return to affirm lower court would mean even prison deprived prisoners basic necessities life continuing basis fact regardless consequences suffering death prisoners would enough justify federal court intervention for court affirm lower court would necessarily mean abandoning holdings rhodes v chapman estelle v gamble west v atkins youngburgh v romeo also rationale deshaney v winnebago county dss government affirmative duty supply basic necessities life deprived ability supply necessities affirming lower court would cause serious doctrinal problems would effect create good faith immunity defense injunctive actions such holding would inconsistent courts settled rule good faith immunities apply solely damages actions and good reason rule court giving prison officials defense damages constitutional deprivation personal fault makes sense denying injunctive relief ground makes sense once continuing conditions confinement prison bad enough violate constitution denying basic necessities life point injunctive relief end suffering fix blame no case court supports application malice standard challenges continuing conditions confinement no case courts appeals lower court decision court today supports result the decision inconsistent fundamental principles eighth amendment jurisprudence established court reversed in case court appeals held critical issue prison officials state mind affidavits petitioner mr wilson put issue prison officials state mind courts decision whitley v albers according court appeals prison officials alleged made affirmative efforts improve conditions could acting quote obduracy wantonness ellipsis court appeals marked persistent malicious cruelty whether one construes holding lower court applying full whitley prison disturbance standard requiring malice sadism newly invented standard lower court requiring malice requiring sadism application malice standard continuing conditions confinement error this case governed rhodes v chapman court dealt challenge continuing conditions confinement in rhodes court held eighth amendment challenges continuing conditions confinement examined determining whether conditions alone combination deprived prisoners minimal civilized measure lifes necessities these necessities set forth rhodes later deshaney include food medical care sanitation shelter reasonable safety had court appeals simply applied rhodes opinion makes clear would remanded wilsons claims trial wilsons claim lack heat provides convenient example court appeals analyzed case rhodes v chapman in brief court prison officials concede lack heat violate eighth amendment wilsons allegations included claim lack heat since prison opened 1983 a lack heat obvious condition the several affidavits support petitioner make slightly different claims all consistent claim complete completely inadequate it appears form heat one affidavit says place heat right around central toilet the affidavits say things frigid air going large cracks walls prisoners put blankets head and therefore lack heat obvious condition this facility three living units no warden facility three living units could aware unaware three winters sort lack heat facility your honor position continuing conditions confinement state mind test relevant however court find state mind test imposed court appeals would still erred applied wrong test if test relevant think continuing conditions relevant test ought deliberate indifference that position fact makes much doctrinal sense simply say continuing conditions confinement state mind test fact analysis going come way since going come way coherent position easier federal courts apply simply say state mind test because obvious condition denies someone basic necessity life continues 3 years necessarily deliberate indifference shortterm conditions raise different issues they in sense rhodes hutto rhodes court said conditions confinement punishment and consistent think idea punishment that conditions cell continue mean punishment and conditions state mind test the reason whitley court applied state mind test dealing conditions imposed said imposed punishment therefore important know and distinction works look longterm shortterm things if condition cell continues 3 years part punishment if heat fails i would agree i would agree tests come exact precisely if look shortterm situation whitley sense shortterm situation looks makes sense find happened if heat boiler broke even negligence part prison officials thats different situation what stops different whatever reason boiler broke 3 years later working thats part punishment thats also deliberate indifference analysis relevant your honor i could respond second question regarding language whitley first the first thing language obdurate wantonness quoted point whitley comes first gregg v georgia later rhodes v chapman in cases language used used refer effects the policy condition people it wasnt fact cases used refer state mind the second thing i would seems thats one way reconcile language whitley it seems way reconcile dictum whitley say precise language court using point conduct we agree difference whether state mind applies shortterm conduct and distinction shortterm events continuing conditions formal government policies reconciles courts eighth amendment decisions easily it also way reconciles estelle v gamble the distinction reconciles courts cases eighth amendment area in fact court i agree one courts go analysis longterm events always come result that deliberate indifference test practice satisfied i think however it less less complicated makes sense cases stanford v kentucky rhodes v chapman forth court remotely suggested state mind element eighth amendment violation look way official government policy continuing condition conditions necessarily part punishment reason look state mind indeed precise language rhodes v chapman held hutto v finney well i obviously paraphrasing broadly conditions case bad violation the conditions violated eighth amendment there slightest suggestion rhodes v chapman state mind relevant determining whether continuing condition confinement violated eighth amendment yes yes and reason court majority estelle also viewed as one time shortterm event series limited individual interactions medical department justice stevens dissent instead said looks could systemic case said i think prescient comment look something systemic case irrelevant state mind test eighth amendment given courts construction estelle medical claim case onetime event courts decision use deliberate indifference standard makes sense no given point you would reach result i agree however given would always reach result obvious condition deprives prisoners basic necessities life need put extra complication law requiring courts look state mind i apologize your honor what i meant systemic word usually used medical area is equivalent long term that continuing denial basic necessity even one prisoner ill reserve balance time thank your honor i want begin going back last series questions mr chief justice asked opposing counsel i want point court appeals found claims raised wilson suggest type seriously indecent conditions proven would violate eighth amendment that first thing court appeals state mind analysis whether conditions alleged bad enough eighth amendment violation on ground already said yes claims rise level i i want go back point whether rhodes anything say whether state mind analysis applies i submit courts discussion rhodes hutto case makes clear rhodes court saw reason state mind test the court rhodes makes clear hutto v finney constitution violated conditions bad there suggestion language element necessary and rhodes hutto also say conditions confinement punishment thats analyzed because punishment sense i think equivalent justice scalias point dont know intentionally imposed when conditions sense one intends natural consequences ones act imposed condition continuing basis part punishment given part punishment whitley simply isnt relevant whitley case analyzes particular conduct imposed punishment might nonetheless violate eighth amendment justice stevens asked well im sorry i one point i want go i want go back whether difference damages injunctive actions now first point i think central point eighth amendment standard either injunctive actions damages actions the standard eighth amendment course differences one speaking damages regard special defenses apply damages injunctive actions the major authority your honor i would cite youngburgh case i wanted go next justice stevens asked financial issues prison officials case made claim reason failed supply necessities life financial reasons but lets assume then would come time would difference damages injunctive actions courts decision youngburgh professional prevented duty lack finances defense damages and cant possibly against professional it cant cant possibly apply defense course injunctive actions question isnt shouldnt look deliberate indifference someone and imagine hard injunctive action would figure actually person denied money that doesnt work thank the honorable court adhjourned tomorrow ten oclock,242.0,353,17,well hear argument no 897376 pearly l wilson v richard seiter well minute ms alexander may proceed are talking ms alexander comparative lack heat total lack heat or tell and say implying would accept test included deliberate indifference one components but tell make determination looking objective factors cant you make inference i mean said warden could let go 3 years without knowing well say something unintentional completely unforeseeable officials necessarily cruel unusual punishment well one test shortterm conditions another long term but also showing deliberate indifference because use objective facts determine institutional state mind why part punishment 3 years know i dont understand i also dont understand say i mean said explicitly whitley obduracy wantonness inadvertence error good faith characterizes conduct prohibited cruel unusual punishments clause whether conduct occurs connection establishing conditions confinement supplying medical needs restoring official control i mean thats obviously frame mind test yes what do well phrase obduracy wantonness goes say inadvertence error good faith thats said whitley inadvertence error good faith yes say reconciles simple fact goes long time easily find absence inadvertence error good faith thats reason reconciles because lasts 3 years impossible believe somebody didnt know so show obduracy it show mental state i dont know basis picking air longtermshortterm distinction where get well blueeyed defendants might whats reason long termshort term i given reason reconciles long term short term its one justice kennedy suggested long term shows different state mind short term well ms alexander certainly estelle gamble claim based failure render medical care prisoners court followed i understand deliberate indifference standard a state mind component well dont think deliberate indifference standard would apply longterm neglect medical care needs well would reach result ms alexander youve confused i thought drawing distinction long term short term colloquy justice oconnor changed systemic versus nonsystemic it long term nonsystemic seems one particular prisoner denied medical treatment long term where come within theology is long term nonsystemic what work even one prisoner thank ms alexander mr bryson well hear what authority 1983 liability accept standard propose would limited far damages concerned as professional thank ms alexander the case submitted,1123.0,1817,26,thank mr chief justice may please court in whitley v albers court determined wantonness obduracy characterize conduct prohibited cruel unusual punishment clause whether conduct occurs connection conditions confinement supplying medical needs quelling prison uprising a necessary balance competing societal interest humane treatment inmates security financial concerns operating nations prisons requires standard affords proper deference prison officials decision making this balance would achieved conditions confinement case defining wantonness obduracy requiring malice no your honor clearly would but since court your honor i think would depend whether named defendants ones culpable state mind if fact warden named defendant would i think instance 1983 action would culpable state mind present behalf named defendant yes would actionable eighth amendment conduct no your honor could sue to contrary your honor there would remedy within state courts rise constitutional deprivation if fact proper named defendant culpable state mind named as alluded in earlier questions could fact collective state mind type inquiry based whether legislature governor i believe could sue governor could sue legislature the governor ability fiscal emergency take appropriate monies necessary fact could resolution within federal judiciary well ability sue state inaudible your honor it states position fact condition constitutes punishment deprives basic human need done wanton obdurate state mind that would way eighth amendment violation able made if fact three elements missing states position that fact fatal eighth amendment claim yes your honor yes your honor in fact when looking conditions confinement your honor fact competing governmental interests issue security financial concerns play role when court looked medical claims raised estelle v gamble i believe fact identified interests inmate free physical injury paramount however looking conditions confinement looking conditions uncomfortable involve type detriment bodily integrity injury illness could result medical case at point that certainly correct your honor at point time serious medical need arises prison officials deliberately indifferent would actionable eighth amendment violation but conditions simply something hypothetical nature if deprivation your honor the deliberate indifference test apply looking medical needs prior condition becoming medical need states position requirement showing form malice competing societal interests issue in fact looking petitioners claims give examples petitioner claims lack ventilation dormitory true requirement behalf prison officials close fire doors crash gates bottom stairwell sufficient hold prisoners clearly example clear security question must left deference prison officials the petitioner also claims challenges classification particular institution assigned classification assignment dormitory facility again goes core securitytype determinations prison officials must afforded wide deference your honor one claims raises has challenged violates eighth amendment yes fact this court recognized courts ill equipped deal increasing urgent problems prison administration would wise secondguess expert administrators matters better informed this court fact readily recognized security special expertisetype decisions behalf prison officials must afforded wide deference the united states case attempts essence apply state mind test looking conditions confinement it clear court looked eighth amendment case inquiry whether claim constitutes cruel unusual punishment petitioner attempts well united states apply test disregards prison officials state mind in fact clearly runs afoul courts decision whitley v albers fact runs afoul number decisions court first whitley court defined wanton obdurate behavior requiring fact malicious sadistic purpose causing harm type mind set yes your honor absolutely your honor that absolutely correct your honor and estelle v gamble another example use state mind analysis looking medical cases the court found deliberate indifference serious medical need again graham v connor court examining fourth amendment question looked terminology fourth amendment compared eighth amendment found terms cruel punishment clearly require intent inquiry intent analysis whereas terms unreasonable fourth amendment your honor i would submit state mind equally important whether physical well may matter intent official it certainly would make equally much sense look intent prison officials medicaltype context your honor instance inmate choked prison official question malicious intent would almost instances type hypothetical implied yes your honor absolutely your honor your honor i believe what consider absolutely your honor yes your honor in fact it necessity using persistent malicious cruelty test afford proper deference prison officials decision making the lower your honor distinction estelle type situation looking systemic conditions confinement yet type physical injury illness fact identifiable medical case in deliberate indifference context specific individual fact seriously ill disregard inmates medical needs when looking conditions confinement need look whether prison officials knowledge existing conditions actions took cure existing conditions barriers action financial otherwise type barriers ability cure deficient conditions we believe lower courts definition persistent malicious cruelty allows ability examination good faith remedial efforts taken cure deficient allegedly deficient conditions also allows ability look whether ongoing policies place maintain habitable conditions place hocking correctional facility this court whitley v albers clear identify inadvertence error good faith identified actionable conduct we believe persistence element lower courts test proscribes that type conduct actionable in addition petitioners claims fail present genuine issue material fact regarding condition confinement yes your honor i believe case court looked conditions existing southern ohio correctional facility found fact doublecelling violate minimal civilized measure lifes necessities i believe court need reach question found deprivation basic human need once element satisfied culpable state mind inquiry really become relevant so court directly address question whether culpable state mind necessary rhodes v chapman decision interpretation that simply necessary inquiry point inquire my understanding no decisions since 1981 decision rhodes v chapman either limits facts way overrules decision what objectively case your honor no your honor i still believe in rhodes v chapman i believe answer would in rhodes v chapman court found deprivation basic human need thats correct your honor correct your honor our position court adopt threepart test requires analysis whether conditions constitute punishment whether inflicted prison official acting wanton obdurate state mind fact whether deprivation basic human need and failure present three claims fatal eighth amendment violation in fact attempt apply petitioner united states attempting argue would result in essence strict liability behalf prison officials all good faith remedial efforts that correct your honor the united states concedes examination state mind looking damage action tries limit argument simply injunctive relief however simply runs afoul courts analysis general 1983 law in fact daniels v williams davidson v cannon court considered fourteenth amendment claims found fact need find something lack due care negligence trigger protection due process clause and daniels court specifically stated given 1983 suit plaintiff must prove violation underlying constitutional right depending right merely negligent conduct simply may enough when looking right question eighth amendment clearly court recognized intent element necessary inquiry make eighth amendment violation so united states attempting proscribe injunctive relief different form identifying cause action fact states position that would simply incorrect the conditions confinement case malice required show wanton in cases your honor i believe court looking element whether something punishment constitutional sense something fact intended punishment in imposing death penalty no your honor that correct your honor it solely limited conditions confinement context it would certainly inconsistent states position your honor i think would still consistent states position consistent precedents court yes your honor when looking question procedural nature case must kept mind motion summary judgment motion dismiss summary judgment recognized court important tool expeditiously resolve disputes summary judgment preserves rights parties disputes heard enables judges determine without trial cases genuine issue material facts exists the courts ability utilize summary judgment particularly important looking eighth amendment claims pro se prisoners entitled liberal construction pleadings make conclusory allegations fairly often denied fact eighth amendment rights subjected cruel unusual punishment as noted amicus brief filed behalf 19 states attorneys general gauge prisoners group prolific litigators the volume prison litigation steadily increasing petitioner classic example individual adding congestion federal courts in last 2 years alone filed 24 federal court appeals since 1976 filed 70 federal court appeals while state mind fact factual question may resolved motion dismiss clearly essential inquiry motion summary judgment if actions taken prison officials show state mind relevant conditions confinement cases prisoner could defeat motion summary judgment merely making conclusory statements mirror reflect conclusory complaint it unavoidable conditions confinement objectionable prisoners however good faith efforts made prison officials fact provide prisoners habitable conditions must considered summary judgment analysis to evaluate whether petitioner fact presented genuine issue material fact court must evaluate objective facts determine whether reasonable jury could find petitioner denied minimal civilized measure lifes necessities whether prison officials acted wanton obdurate state mind petitioner denied minimal civilized measure lifes necessity defined include food clothing shelter medical care reasonable safety the threshold level unpleasant conditions become constitutional violation defined point petitioner personally offended no your honor i think court directly recognized anderson state mind question certainly appropriate disposition summary judgment in fact inquiry would trial directed verdict question and question whether reasonable jury could conclude your honor i think due deference i believe court previously recognized anderson ability decide questions state mind summary judgment level well directed verdict level trial thats correct your honor that correct your honor that correct and record believe reasonable jury could concluded respondents acted wanton obdurate state mind petitioners denied minimal civilized measure lifes necessities when looking solely objective facts show efforts taken prison officials question petitioners complaints simply state eighth amendment violation regardless whether court defines wanton obdurate purposes conditions confinement cases requiring deliberate indifference persistent malicious cruelty question petitioner simply presented genuine issue material fact court the petitioner made series complaints basically identify pleased housed dormitory facility he believes inadequate cooling believes restrooms unclean kitchen facilities unclean excessive noise however record shows undisputed affidavits petitioners claims occasionally subjected 95 degree temperatures certainly ohio residents without air conditioning likewise subjected shows ventilation adequately maintained summer months open windows two large fans placed end dormitory petitioners claims unclean restrooms kitchen facilities also countered the evidence shows restrooms cleaned two times day additionally spot cleaned needed the kitchen areas dining room areas cleaned every meal prison individuals work kitchens required wear plastic gloves hats and fact inmates prison staff your honor i believe lower court identify whitley v albers wantonness obduracy controls analysis conditions confinement claims they add additional sentence said wantonness obduracy would defined behavior marked persistent malicious cruelty the court apply whitley v albers test argued opponent in fact nowhere entirety opinion word sadistic utilized unquestionably analysis looked sadistic state mind would required additional evidence simply showing malice clearly inquiry state mind without question lower court found correctly evidence could supported reasonable jury determination prison officials acted wanton obdurate state mind and position respondents regardless standard utilized analyzing wantonness obduracy deliberate indifference malice persistent malicious cruelty outcome case there evidence record would show prison officials way acted wanton obdurate state mind in conclusion your honors cruel unusual punishment clause never intended serve escape unpleasantness imprisonment ohio seek operate prisons without regard prisoners constitutional rights however inmates encouraged use federal courts arbiters grievances amount uncomfortable living conditions the lower court imposed meaningful test protects rights inmates still allows appropriate deference prison officials decision making therefore respondents respectfully request court affirm grant summary judgment lower court thank your honors,428.0,659,44,may i ask mentioned financial concerns would always defense warden matter bad conditions say i tried get money legislature wouldnt appropriate but because acting entirely good faith nothing wanton he cant get money well name everybody prison staff boy scouts they want help much legislature didnt appropriate money and could could prisoners sue could sue state so thered would remedy case i pose what would remedy oh state courts but would federal remedy no im assuming nobody culpable state mind they trying help prisoners cannot get money legislature wont appropriate and conditions andersonville you cannot imagine worse conditions remedy proposal no federal remedy on behalf but who sue collective state mind dont sue state well governor also urged legislation legislature wouldnt pass but would guilty violating eighth amendment exercise extraordinary power appropriate kind money even though thought best interest matter political philosophy thought legislature ought what lack medical care do think estelle test applicable deliberate indifference and prison conditions lack food why wouldnt apply standard well play role medical care i dont see distinguish but might involve things actually if food insufficient circumstances incarceration were subjected abuse injury prisoners i mean could wide variety things would cause severe medical results effect and wouldnt apply test theyre inhuman medical thats odd line seems but contend ms eppler wrong classification cruel unusual punishment in context prison riot course and i thought opinion careful say might different mental component contexts i thought referred specifically estelle gamble example will help state mind point if cut breathing stop breathing matter to state mind does matter im strangled of course doesnt well reason would choke you would would implied but would consider so arguing considering applying when complain air coming room freezing find whether intended maliciously they knowing full well but addition to prove preponderance evidence malicious then isnt equally true go back justice oconnors question isnt equally appropriate medical care context i understand youre saying i missing point distinguish estelle what test think rhodes chapman used that prison conditions case i know what test standard did think that case included mental element deciding eighth amendment issue and think rhodes chapman overruled confined facts anything kind later cases may i ask question rhodes case supposing proof unlikely internal memoranda smoking guns sorts things proved warden staff hated prisoners malicious state mind exactly objectively an eighth amendment violation no objectively rhodes chapman you conditions fact motivated malicious state mind warden colleagues hated prisoners thought couldnt get away anything they imposed doublecelling thought would make prisoners uncomfortable wanted harm would violate so malicious state mind sole criteria its one necessary sufficient condition well strict liability action injunction not necessarily opponent pointed action damages let interrupt i may what capital punishment cases is requirement malicious intent part state say cant impose death sentence crime rape that true regardless states intent isnt right but im suggesting theres requirement state motivated kind special malicious intent cases yeah so youre argument goes confinement cases maybe justice stevens question suggests youre wrong establish earlier three separate criteria that maybe one always exist deprivation basic necessity life including life either two either intent punish would explain capital punishment cases taking away persons life intentionally order punish person malicious anything order so dont way there must either intent punish say intent punish thats purpose nonetheless done requisite state mind ranging indifference wantonness i dont know want describe would explain cases i thought state mind issues almost inappropriate summary judgment thats true issue put state mind seems certainly inviting waiting jury trial decide you say threestep inquiry and one missing fatal case including deprivation basic conditions life ms eppler wasnt ground court appeals sixth circuit went things deprivations whatever state mind they said order deprivations show state mind set forth whitley opinion really didnt get question whether state mind shown nevertheless would deprivations but wanton obdurate words court appeals use certainly suggest sort subjective inquiry thank ms eppler ms alexander 4 minutes remaining do rebuttal,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,386.0,579,9,mr chief justice may please court our position case stated simply prisoner subjected cruel unusual punishment conditions confinement deny minimal level basic human needs now follows that conditions confinement issue need inquire state mind certainly need inquire find conditions product i quote persistent malicious cruelty defendants court appeals suggest this not need inquire reason that right because duty there that your honor would consider prison conditions that something happens prison happens people live outside prison it something thats act god it isnt something product incarceration part punishment your honor reason reason resist notion negligence resist deliberateness simply really comes class cases particularly concerned and suppose warden prison officials prison officials trying good job dont resources there reason way resources allocated legislature requirements law cant provide services basic human necessity human life they cant provide enough decent food they cant provide enough decent shelter the fact arent acting bad faith deliberately even negligently defense injunctive action if want you could you could your honor could say collective deliberate indifference virtue somebody cant point finger particular person somewhere there deliberate indifference world could anybody allow conditions like continue without deliberately indifferent now seems created fiction it view direct way approach problem going way result instances perhaps instances result well may though when speak deliberate indifference normal sense somebody kind moral culpability respect conduct it may nobody one person legislature ever sat looked situation said problem going attend so normally say deliberate indifference talking somebody reckless something like recklessness we dont think required but course court construes term deliberate indifference way impose kind moral requirement recklessness simply says condition general condition prisons denies people necessities life thats deliberate indifference come exactly come you one step process exactly your honor your honor looked cases yes well i would look first best statement deshaney case if i read well discuss it admittedly dictum i think dictum telling court said respect explicitly eighth amendment said duty someone custody taken custody thereby deprived ability fend themself nonprisoners due process clause prisoners eighth amendment duty provide basic necessities life that your honor position court set forth no your honor rhodes chapman hutto finney court said essentially thing i think clearly deshaney case west atkins youngburgh romeo but cases either premise explicit point duty eighth amendment case somebody custody provide basic necessities life you cant let someone starve deprived ability feed thats right and suggestion intent our suggestions respect precise question certainly malicious sadistic intent even persistent malicious intent sixth circuit respondents suggest yes and would whitley albers in words cruel usual punishment well case one person sets punish another even single isolated instance if i prison warden decide punish prisoner number 443 arranging cell mate attack thats violation cruel unusual punishment clause actionable but doesnt mean thats thing thats actionable doesnt mean although state mind necessary case isolated instance state mind also necessary cases involving general continuing conditions i think problem reiterate see position court appeals took respondents arguing leaves major hole cruel unusual punishment jurisprudence court lower courts recognized years we asking radical change way cruel unusual case punishment cases litigated this read cases one another lower courts standard used they said conditions unacceptable if product general prison conditions thats violation and i think court fact adopts position urged upon state radical change nature cruel unusual punishment litigation would strongly urge court follow path thank the estelle test seems to go nature medical care adequate in words oh yes i thats right yes yes problem that,106.0,181,9,not even negligence you consider negligence state mind right it doesnt even require negligence what hurricane lights go prison air conditioning its terrible 2 days help cant get is more specifically product anybodys negligence deliberateness but could say state the state legislature guilty deliberate indifference hypothetical i dont consider fiction legislature default obvious duty well mr bryson really submitting quite broad proposition court much intent idea cruel unusual punishment prisoners provided minimal regard minimal food clothing shelter what authority court go ahead tell authorities the deshaney case doesnt deal eighth amendment all dicta deshaney sweeping proposition but granted certiorari case whether malicious sadistic intent requirement we didnt take decide whole range questions sort things prisons furnish its basically question intent must shown fail provide something in justice scalias hypothetical hurricane i take prison warden anger prisoners arranged heating plumbing conditions applied would say cruel unusual wouldnt in words hoses prisoners water turns heat so cruel unusual intentional component but would leave estelle test intact medical and would leave whitley place prison security involved thank mr bryson ms eppler well hear

representing petitioner action in north dakota statute provides corporation applies pharmacy permit majority stock corporation must owned registered pharmacist good standing actively regularly employed responsible actual management operation supervision pharmacy now respondent action applied pharmacy permit and application disclosed stock corporation owned red owl stores large supermarket chain midwest known shareholders red owl registered pharmacists the state board pharmacy north dakota denied application based upon reason comply ownership law i mentioned the respondent appealed district court raise various constitutional questions mainly due process clause fourteenth amendment equal protection clause various constitutional issues north dakota constitution motion summary judgment the district court relied liggett versus baldridge’s decision case declared statute violation due process clause also violation equal protection clause unconstitutional the petitioner appealed north dakota supreme court north dakota supreme court basically relied entirely liggett versus baldridge’s decision court 1928 stated bound decision liggett versus baldridge see insufficient reason distinguish decision case sustain trial court’s conclusion the liggett decision based upon pennsylvania statute  that’s correct well ownership compliance problem physical safeguard problem that’s correct your honor they decided fact question regard physical safeguards well final regard constitutional question it remanded back additional hearing regard physical safeguard problem facility well would appealed i imagined respondent adverse physical safeguard feature no i think decision final regard constitutional questions presented on liggett decision involved pennsylvania statute required 100 ownership pharmacist north dakota supreme court liggett decision based entirely due process clause fourteenth amendment we feel basic issue whether liggett versus baldridge decision proper authority north dakota supreme court rely reversed reversed now large change philosophy supreme court regard legal writers referred economic due process since liggett versus baldridge decision in briefs traced history citing lochner adkins coppage later cases rejected cases in examining later cases griswold versus connecticut ferguson versus skrupa williamson versus lee optical daniel versus family security savion versus hostetler it’s clear examination least doctrine prevailed coppage adkins lochner cases abandoned court this court stated emphatically refused go back time used due process clause strike state laws regulatory business economic affairs feel unwise prudent harmony particular school thought the court stated set superlegislature judge wisdom need reasonable us merits state laws touch economic problems business affairs social conditions system government issues properly left legislative branch government now daniel versus family security life case specific reference made liggett case said rational followed case find expression liggett versus baldridge decision pronounced shift emphasis since liggett versus baldridge decision also i stated various state court decisions said collins liggett seriously limited completely undermined now based decisions feel extreme presumption constitutionality validity state legislation particular area north dakota legislature determined evil present rational way prevent evil correct exposure evil efficient sustain constitutionality validity statute set facts reasonably justify statute feel efficient now respondent brief raised also equal protection clause amicus brief national association chain drug stores devoted time i think basically governed standard review due process clause invidious discrimination prohibited states wide latitude regard i think it’s got standard due process clause effect also left states wisdom judgment far passage legislation now amicus national association chain drug stores also raised commerce clause issue raised first time appeal i don’t think it’s properly raised consideration raised first time appeal however case i cite mainly state’s attempt protect local industry exclusion national industry outside national commerce depot case say dean versus city madison case state attempted protect local industry requiring milk process within five miles it process within five miles city madison and particular statute applies case equally local corporations local chain stores  local chain stores chain stores within state north dakota law applies equally well national chain stores might refer also feel statute anything interstate commerce i think it’s safe say prescription drugs manufactured state north dakota and i think i also say prescription drugs properly approved federal government available north dakota and volume sale prescription drugs course governed prescriptions doctors and example led hundred chain stores hundred stores opened state theoretically greater sale prescription drugs limited prescriptions i think would point  it’s demand prescription drugs filled state evidence course regard mr lucas opinion real purpose behind statute well feel related public health welfare do want cover point i would time well historically know impetus enactment north dakota minnesota south dakota well primary purpose time i think one main purposes prohibit physician ownership drugstores precisely and therefore public health i think you’re quite correct made statement i  in california medical clinic case hearings decision documented inherent conflict interest positions pharmacy i imagine  tragic situation it’s ethical public health approach well it’s related public health physician course he call prescriptions they don’t go store he charge higher prices he carry lower inventory items limit prescriptions certain items make profitable the public may end using drugs on approach however justifies hospital exemption statute well mainly  physician make dispense prescriptions i suppose hospital feel supervised properly physicians hospitals they want… presumably physician pharmacy would supervised physician but hospital won’t owned physician it owned hospital well place hospitals owned physicians that correct i don’t know north dakota apparently physician probably supervised result danger public account i one last question suppose pharmacist owning drug store sells stock 49 happens practical matter does go business does place go business if pharmacist sells stock 49 yes nonpharmacist yes you would compliance statute that correct he could and still  would board put put business that never happened knowledge i suppose would determination board time way statute reads i might add pennsylvania maryland also antiphysician prohibition ownership pharmacies and also united states senate hart ph bill various hearings senate i think determined abusers shown record well california case well distinct ethical problem one time perhaps still you’ve heard california situation i think also feel nonpharmacist ownership resolved subordination professional responsibility professional service commercial motives now feel might emphasize profit there’s lot ways emphasize profit investors nonpharmacist stores course looking return investment and thing using drugs legislators bring traffic sell products branch builders grass seeds thing they keep inventory carry fast moving items understaff pharmacy pharmacist work long hours little brief rest time lunch results mental fatigue possibility error filling prescription but isn’t equally true pharmacist’s pharmacy we’ll feel pharmacist  professional would sensitive problems and realized public service public responsibility police within profession similar perhaps law provision laws may protect problems areas it’s enforcement problem and north dakota one inspector perhaps state board he’s got duties simply can’t enforce problems feel way would resolve internal policy profession pharmacists control how sure one fact if opponents prevail i take object provision pharmacy shall run registered pharmacist no they objection regard in brief admitted prohibition physician ownership valid purpose they recognized briefs i think that’s plan i trying make believe bought believe rational basis statute protection i think true required court’s going try second guess legislature that presumption it’s valid purpose valid statute mr lucas many states statutes rigorous requiring pharmacists may drugstores north dakota one majority requirement michigan 25 requirement it’s gone supreme court three times date majority decision declared unconstitutional it’s unusual situation two three justices wrote thought unconstitutional one wrote opinion first it’s  every judge wrote opinion the justice wrote opinion there’s majority decision court and new york i understand passed legislation recent session vetoed governor based upon liggett versus baldridge decision alaska i believe recently  are saying state new york allow chain drug stores they oh just provision  statute similar passed recently vetoed vetoed oh well arguments make support rational basis statute record they record decided motion summary judgment we opportunity present evidence regard in michigan various hearings welldocumented testimony pharmacologists practicing pharmacists michigan various individuals we may wanted opportunity you think could produce evidence yes despite experience 48 states i’m certain present evidence i’m sure there’ll contrary evidence certainly debatable questions when statute enacted 1963 is documentary legislative history one get state legislature mr lucas i think respondent’s brief they short synopsis reasons given time it’s one branch either senate congress doesn’t cover hearings but i believe hearings held houses judgment hearings i think one without hearings transcribed no they’re just shortened notes notes whoever employed time how far back kind law go state until 1963 passed but thought one 1920 not north dakota the pennsylvania new york statute 1920 1929 mr lucas i sure i could hear mr justice powell’s question i may repetitious if prevail would wish case remanded development record issue public health well we’ve asked would fine basically like liggett versus baldridge reversed clearly reversed time north dakota’s supreme court relied completely liggett versus baldridge would result reversal north dakota’s supreme court believe well that’s true that’s i’m throwing arguments relating public account you said earlier constitutional question closed if reversed  north dakota supreme court that’s feel fear and court would reverse decision would close one point well i don’t understand opened closed right well question physical facility still open whether proper receiving areas don’t carry drugs coming conveyor belt things type and security measure around facility open but constitutional question closed  do also stop drugstore selling attract us laughter well that’s what’s happened they got areas it could we require certain physical safeguard chain door barrier kind secure area rest areas stock  stocking shelves they’re walking pharmacy but could chain area type long secured now let’s assume supreme court state affirmed grounds people entitled  let’s assume affirmed grounds would come that would declared statute constitution mean yes but also said entitled another reason no i don’t believe could come well  come well i think  because grounds  supreme court well basically i think it’s relied entirely liggett versus baldridge position court think reverse issue i know still may entitled license because physical safeguards yes but would still mean statute constitutional ownership statute that may but let us say supreme court said statute unconstitutional people entitled anyway another reason based state law you couldn’t come declared statute unconstitutional well think raise us constitutional question would allow us come there adequate state ground kind decision justice white talking whether win lose constitutional question they’ll still barred decision that’s adequately based state grounds so i don’t  difference case case comes us narrow doesn’t seem to much different well i think it’s basically whether proper decision court  liggett versus baldridge since relied entirely liggett versus baldridge we talking jurisdiction that’s we’re talking yes sir well isn’t another way uttering mr justice rehnquist’s question finality judgment it’s obvious justices either side questions well statute declared due process clause us constitution  i think it’s jurisdiction if statute still determined constitutional it’s still event i could speak use i don’t think that would  what would meantime would try enforce statute face adverse decision supreme court states which can’t point i suppose you’d also final judgment since conceded  board conceded otherwise people entitled others aside stock ownership people entitled license that’s correct do yes don’t no don’t we think there’s still physical safeguard problem i don’t think it’s serious constitutional problem we feel professional pharmacies going offer certain services nonprofessional pharmacies may a lot services don’t resolve volume profit anything pharmacy drug consultation one item feel professionals give counseling patients interaction drugs incompatibilities abuse type a new area new new jersey require medication profile monitor pharmacy keeps track drugs prescribed dispensed particular patient and sees two three four different doctors pharmacy record items dispensed that patient receiving we monitor prescriptions tell incompatibilities abuse date prescriptions things type it also offers delivery emergency hours open charged accounts lot larger chain store drugs don’t and feel professional services related public health welfare offered now feel pharmacy profession that’s decided case law statute don’t feel treated differently professional law medicine optometry dentistry two cases us supreme court optometry dentistry state corporation cannot practice licensed individuals those particular professions feel profession pharmacy treated way we submit philosophy liggett abandoned ask it’d clearly reversed time therefore north dakota supreme court also reversed subject question cited  mr lucas may i ask one question i think we’d agree practicing profession pharmacy could accomplished licensed pharmacist but talking ownership would accomplish essential objectives law we dont think we want people position making policy professionals a pharmacist yield nonprofessional nonprofessional owns place he either says lose job and don’t want professional yielding position want policy makers professionals offer services think necessary well isn’t pharmacist drawn rules pharmacist association state he  is offensive thing it your honor but nonowner says lose job going well choice losing license job right but  it’s choice we feel professionals sensitive  it choice make right we feel professional pharmacist sensitive area professional responsibility professional service and subordinate objectives commercial motives and pharmacists north dakota enough money run thing well they’re yes sir yes your honor that’s correct your honor if refused commit illegal act someone pharmacist might carry illegal act give prescription given give medicine without prescription done thereby public health injured we feel your honor also i placed responsibility nonpharmacist competent really determine competency particular pharmacist and incompetent misconduct say “well could i know i’m pharmacist” i big problem stockholders running pharmacist i would think stockholder wants return money he whether filled prescription stockholders going supervise pharmacist well majority ownership means control that gives majority board directors determine policy want  as provide new comer new batlle wise i would assume every stockholder wouldn’t even know drug right but think pharmacists going know if they’re  how many pharmacists court i’m sure your honor i mention because one whether don’t limit number pharmacists way well would limited  well one pharmacist could one pharmacy law majority control pharmacy we local chain probably six locations six major cities could owned one individual majority ownership now want policy  and could pharmacies owner given pharmacy collect money couldn’t well could but least one would ensure would understanding profession  but wouldn’t sure practice would no but would likely would watch understand professional objectives that’s point state conceived that bias if voted must thought thank mr chief justice may please court i don’t anything real urgent i’d like say return motion i admitted question fact regard basic ownership stock i think there’s obvious question fact whether statute related public health safety and one point far relating i didn’t mention in north dakota course need small town pharmacies and get interstate highways ease chance  getting bigger cities chain stores advertise course motor oil dollar run mart get motor oil pick prescriptions hurts small town pharmacies and public health requirement necessity i think small towns pharmacies another basis could used justify thank you,302.0,352,9,we’ll hear arguments next number 721176 north dakota board pharmacy snyder mr lucas may proceed whenever you’re ready mr lucas go understanding procedural history case may little bit different let check as i understand north dakota district court trial court gave summary judgment snyder’s and basis constitutional provision north dakota law violated constitutional provision pharmacy board’s conclusion drug store meet space requirements also invalid first summaries and i take pharmacy board two reasons turning snyder and appealed supreme court north dakota supreme court north dakota affirmed constitutional issue reversed district court didn’t space issue saying board proceedings do think final judgment purposes jurisdiction and i suppose pharmacy board could fine snyder’s issue could lose  could denied license there’d case would but likely constitutional basis going back minute propositions mr justice blackmun inquiring even isn’t demonstrable provable premises legislation enacted actually true isn’t constitutional question whether state legislator right think impact public health well ordinarily way rational basis test applied isn’t testimony hearings lower court it’s state facts conceived court you don’t generally rely live witnesses sort  if snyder’s drug prevails words supreme court north dakota decision remain standing under north dakota statute could red owl supermarket one side market groceries things sell side room drug store or prohibitions but wouldn’t forever bar getting constitutional question what next time around another drug operation found qualified rested prior holding you could come – presumably could try come couldnt or particular case i take thing went back pharmacy board pharmacy board decides space requirements met could still appeal north dakota supreme system may lose issue you’ll certainly lose constitutional issue there’s indication supreme court north dakota change mind but genuinely final judgment issuance vel non license turns constitutional question nothing else well point square must a pharmacist subordinate manager establishment someone tried get prescription illegally use expired prescription put pressure speak number one committed illegal act wouldn’t likely report anybody i assume that’s reasonable again come back whether rational north dakota legislature believe it’s likely whether prove it’s likely very well mr lucas mr vogelmr mart r vogel thank gentlemen the case submitted,1440.0,1553,13,mr chief justice may please court in response several questions raised jurisdictional issue final judgment the judgment entered case admit trial judge specified directed pharmacy board hold hearing issues raised board connection space pharmacy within 60 days yes your honor if i may i would like take minutes discuss chronology  well may i ask anything are suggesting jurisdictional question line said i merely answering question mr justice rehnquist first raised whether final judgment i don’t believe gets  well it’s what it’s happen jurisdiction well it’s question  i noticed response petition per se jurisdiction simply sentence this panel question jurisdiction said court that correct we brief say yes my opinion i would like see final decision court constitutional issue of course even though  i know everyone comes would like i but limitations jurisdiction court yes mr chief justice while  what there’s jurisdiction dismissal still got benefit state supreme court declared unconstitutional statute you won’t declare indeed sir we i think could based upon final judgment assuming example board’s finding respect space requirement supported trial judge affirmed appeal supreme court i assume could take appeal appeal could i apply writ granted would back want us say work right we want say court even though  jurisdiction i merely answering question mr justice whether judgment final one and honestly isn’t in fact surprised tell truth you’re writ came no yes i sure would allow  well overlooked we used honest i would like go history little already dealt because  i think establishes real purpose object legislature passing act the law 1963 came unsuccessful attempt board pharmacy made eliminate regulation doctorowned pharmacies they attempted passing somewhat similar statute except regulation aimed positions and course expressed purpose statute minutes senate committee law originated established prevent doctors taking pharmacies supply means legal remedy prevent done now mr lucas made statement agree doctorowned pharmacy could evil we don’t admit don’t concede we’ve never said we merely indicated might assuming evidence establish there might legitimate purpose preventing physicians also owning operating pharmacies then 1968 family centered drugstore applied permit rejected board pharmacy upon grounds board utilized instant case it’s difficult sit imagine liggett still good law i’ve quite never i recalled asking reaffirmation reaffirmation principle it belongs ive cover laughter attempt it passed limbo yes why doesn’t state right control corporations business state they i don’t understand they right but i may  because old substantive due process this old cases well know you’re familiar yes i familiar old cases counsel liggett owen j roberts owen j roberts later sit court owen j roberts great advocate substantive due process alright i mean permissible  i can’t imagine i might shepardize thing see actually still exists have shepardize yes your honor aren’t astounded it’s still around laughter no you’ve never overruled opportunity overruling i personally i refer court plural in fact i believe 1949  mr justice clark referred liggett case indicating narrowed stating overruled  why couldn’t state say corporations can’t use peddling drugs the state  pardon possibly state could perhaps that’s right corporation foreign corporation coming  then what’s  justify terms modern points reference constitution know because say standard still liggett well due process clause fourteenth amendment still constitution and equal protection i beg pardon sir yes i think several cases court lands support the recent cases eisenstadt case example lynch case i think came 1972 i think there’s goldberg case came 1971 there’s griswold connecticut there’s rowe there’s doe i think number cases indicate could least changing turnaround court’s deal property rights compared court’s view liberty fourteenth amendment i would put operation due process equal protection mr lucas  yes right property and corporations mr chief justice also law strikes individual an individual account pharmacist owned pharmacy and law restricted even pennsylvania statute license that course true and can’t practice pharmacy without meeting north dakota standards oh yes as put ownership basis say due really operation pharmacy the pharmacy must still operated licensed pharmacist it must run managed licensed pharmacist propose state comes says one except pharmacist may drugstore that say view showing made trial court and although mr lucas says opportunity introducing evidence contrary every opportunity he could presented deposition course affidavit required rule respect summary judgment also decisions supreme court that would but wouldn’t say corporation pharmacy i beg pardon could north dakota pass law saying pharmacy cannot owned corporations and i going combine law medicine right answer well your honor given criteria statute real substantial relation public health safety morals yes i’d say well  say lawyer cannot practice corporation well state and view view i think we’ve suggested brief lawyer client entirely represents entirely different relationship like physician  it like physician patient like physician pharmacist physician drugstore it would and mr lucas return motion summary judgment flatly stated respect constitutional issue solely law produced evidence couldn’t well rule i remember must mere argument well law but federal constitution law state directly says there’s need evidence using gradual basis well perhaps i guess right but lower court indication whatsoever factual situations could result upholding statute one bearing substantially upon public health safety welfare there wasn’t slightest indication and supreme court north dakota pointed assurance but court sent back evidentiary hearing evidence would could produced in reading briefs submitted appellant amicus imaginary situations call attention text credulity i would think impartial judge i’m laughter attempt course  contend chain store drug business interested commercialization drugs put could poor drugs well  that’s i think surely recent expressions court cases i quoted handed last term indication we still proposition statute cannot based upon imaginary ills could dredged but statute must bear substantial relationship public health safety morals and furthermore pointed statute object i think that’s indicated appendix brief the committee minutes could located object prevent doctors taking pharmacy business detriment local drugstore owner i think argument made i think raised california doctor owns drugstore patient comes he’s going see drug business funneled drugstore and may prescribing drugs i guess probably contended california case interest drugstore i  your client hooked big chain yes the snyder drug your honor i think something like 35 37 drugstores they operate five midwestern states minnesota iowa they’ve business long time i think employ something like 120 pharmacists they highly reputable organization efficient one oh yes supermarket chain yes your honor all stock mr vogel perhaps you’ve answered if i missed course isn’t case but would position pharmacy boards regulation nearly directed physicians owning pharmacies from knowledge i think it’s common knowledge north dakota number in fact fargo i think three large medical groups pharmacies it’s efficient way handling drug problem physician’s clinics individual doctors so state pharmacy board barrier kind thing other statute the ownership one if board turn around away one say physicians pharmacies would attitude again i say isn’t case i understand unanswered question well california know sustained constitutionality statute i seriously question constitutionality i seen definite proof way physician doesn’t operate ethically would kind act  statute would aimed so i’d still say would indication statute attacked  rather i withdraw rather real substantial relationship public health safety morals public mr lucas respond issue commerce clause raised national association chain drugstores brief he says shouldn’t considered wasn’t raised lower court we hope consider think applicable we’re sorry overlook lower court proceeding but surely institution snyder drugs large area operation five different states i’ve mentioned prevented crossing state lines purpose distributing product our judgment judgment amicus adapt definite interference commerce clause constitution and fact note committee meetings i think one legislators referred statute fence legislation put fence around north dakota outsiders’ chain drugstores could enter well would legitimate statement i like state much many times i don’t know problems but i could see people live don’t many people north dakota might become subject exploitations delaware corporation around country using little vacuum cleaner suck north dakota money possible leaving nothing behind tax base laid schools built i see state saying going stop i don’t see would follow a good category health certain welfare welfare sense welfare people don’t agree no your honor i can’t agree i think that definitely would interfering interstate commerce aside drugstore business chains  i talking stopping  removing good i talking requiring every druggist state every merchant state could single entrepreneur well i go back standard you got big revolutions north dakota our court sustained 1920 yes sir remember yes i we also proposal one legislature early 30’s north dakota see sead union have considered recently laughter a bill  honestly introduced effect that might solved turtle mountain problem last case laughter well would’ve solved problem obviously we wouldn’t but several minutes left i really want say we’re contending fourteenth amendment intended interfere reasonable exercise police power we contend act unreasonable evidence produced snyder’s time hearing trial court effect it’s conducted drug business would north dakota pharmacist strictly people’s benefit post regulation federal state statutes regulation promulgated statutes reason law isn’t evil and don’t think abandoned entirely  haven’t abandoned proposition liggett legislative means must substantially legislative ends or least say must showing made state minimal rational means relationship  object statute we maintained statute makes sense in far public health welfare make sense purpose keep druggist business could make sense assuming proof physician drugstore thank you,198.0,255,15,that response supreme court’s order you would acknowledge can’t control jurisdiction stipulation is question rights  course followed rights states try get back resolved factual issues state court you don’t justify didn’t didnt want laughter all factors always disclosed petitions position did  i don’t recall challenge way i think justice brennan said you’d rather consider jurisdiction would perhaps allow examination subject just  pass practice medicine example practice law what vlandis kline think lands support do think court’s decision last term vlandis kline residency requirement state tuition lands support position in category put operation pharmacy corporation in property youre talking interferes property law but can’t practice medicine north dakota i assume without meeting north dakota’s standards isn’t right well that’s really comes legislature said  effect operation pharmacy establishment something pharmacists primarily that’s real contention isn’t mr vogel statement moment ago mr lucas obligation supply affidavits north dakota summary judgment procedure that would limited situation disputed issue fact can i  i suppose ordinary way rational basis test justify statute isn’t parade witnesses arguments conceivable states facts really considered courts pretty much abstract aren’t well would say language i think mcgowan maryland perhaps cases conceivable basis imagined court must support sustain state action do say it’s conceivable fears it could warranted legislature wouldn’t almost follow didn’t want doctors would much less want businessmen if reach little bit well record show snyder drug turn owned red owl thank

duty juno alaska subject court martial jurisdiction the court military appeals decision case reversed two reasons id like discuss first facts case establish service connection second court military appeals found court martial jurisdiction case employed erroneous deficient service connection test this court recognized special needs military justify unique military justice system but also recognized court martial jurisdiction limited least possible power adequate end proposed in courts ocallahan relford decisions limited court martial jurisdiction requiring service connection established service member tried civilian type offenses committed base this purpose service connection requirement balance interests service member greater protections civilian trial military interest trying case court martial the criteria thats correct justice blackmun not new york offense the alaska alaska authorities given tentative deferral prosecution coast guard but also indications interest part alaska record in record indicated alaska continuing investigate allegations charges others daughters civilians community and also message coast guard indicated state alaska previously fairly recently previously prosecuted coast guardsmen similar offenses thats correct justice blackmun the criteria relevant balancing test limited infinite permutations possibly relevant factors cause confusion proper limits court martial jurisdiction and outcome balancing tests depends facts case in case theres military interest outweighs petitioners interest greater protections civilian trial now limits court martial jurisdiction based solely facts fact court martials give service members protections would receive civilian trial the military justice system created serve fundamentally different purpose purpose civilian courts the military justice system tool maintaining discipline military and another reason limiting court martial jurisdiction historic disapproval trying ordinary crimes court martial well ocallahan decision basically goes history especially time founding country also history english ancestors basically states disapproval generally trying civilian type offenses court martial well perhaps impliedly overturn decisions but part well even founding country ocallahan seems indicate period time country ordinary offenses tried court martial and certain court martial try court martial dependent military contractor ordinary type crime would disapproved well would disapproved court this court decided as i say i believe founding fathers history ancestors england indicate i dont think early decisions court directly addressed particular issue well extension i believe cases started limit jurisdiction people like military contractors dependents the court military appeals apply courts relford service connection analysis case it totally ignored unjustifiable minimized petitioners interest greater protections civilian trial but even court military appeals applied relford criteria would found service connection question isnt even close the facts case simply show significant impact offenses coast guard the petitioner case enlisted man coast guard at court martial convened coast guard base governors island charged 21 specifications alleging sexual molestation four girls fourteen specifications alleged offenses two victims committed base duty juno alaska these offenses trial judge dismissed lack service connection the seven remaining specifications alleged offenses two different victims base governors island jurisdiction offenses never contested all victims daughters coast guardsmen the government tried establish service connection case asserting every imaginable impact coast guard could possibly result effect offenses victims fathers factually however government unable prove significant direct impact coast guard trial as trial judge properly found impact remote indirect military interest offenses could adequately vindicated civilian trial when makeweight arguments concerning nondispositive factors stripped away court military appeals decision clear based entirely dependent status victims the court military appeals discuss two factors unrelated dependent status victims pendency court martial charges difficulties state alaska might face prosecuting petitioner these simply makeweight arguments however they nothing impact offenses coast guard and factors easily manipulated far removed real interests balanced helpful setting clear limits court martial jurisdiction because dependent status victims court military appeals also discussed nature offenses age victims it found offenses made fathers less effective unwilling serve petitioner future from inferred units would suffer less morale this overstated rather unlikely loss morale really direct arguably direct impact coast guard court military appeals discussed other impacts offhand justice scalia i cant think one but doesnt mean arent others another problem inference based impact offenses victims fathers kind inferences drawn serious offense dependent victim therefore holding kind factors significant tantamount holding dependent status victim sufficient establish service connection but basically whether court military appeals decision viewed resting entirely dependent status victims factors reversed relied erroneous service connection test require proof military interest that military interest outweighed petitioners interest civilian trial the court military appeals decision glossed fact trial judge applied relford criteria case didnt find single one supported service connection well i think ocallahan relford also courts schlesinger decision imply theres balancing militarys interest prosecuting case service members interest trial civilian court justice white thats reading cases no sir i think closest i think closest comes perhaps language schlesinger basically summarizes service connection test indicates unique military interest cant adequately vindicated civilian court now admittedly thats summarization its kind shorthand doesnt take factors go test but i think indicates thats good crisis comes i think thats one main justifications well one would something affected no sir the thing would yes sir the thing would trigger would impact mission military i think something affected discipline mission military would justify court martial jurisdiction the i intended restatement language ocallahan i believe relford decision occurred military base would court martial jurisdiction thats correct your honor i think relford decision indicated crime violence violates property military base may sufficient justify service connection is excuse justice white the service connection analysis applied court military appeals bound result courts service connection courts relford service connection analysis requires rather seems military interest sufficient outweight petitioners interest civilian trial the court military appeals seems embraced position one writer suggested imagination prosecutor limitation court martial jurisdiction the court military appeals service connection analysis flexible meaningless it permits military courts base jurisdiction single factor combination factors tangible intangible proven presumed it invites confusion court eliminated remarkably clear relford decision the court military appeals analysis doesnt set limits yes sir justice scalia i believe mr fidell going address point the court military appeals analysis doesnt set limits factors considered it sets law service connection back time relford decision concern infinite permutations possibly relevant factors would cause confusion proper limits court martial jurisdiction this courts relford decision especially clear helpful it sets analytic framework based definite criteria those relford criteria touchstone service connection analysis even accepting arguments sake criteria exhaustive doesnt justify court military appeals ignoring relford criteria deciding service connection question case solely basis factors if questions id like reserve remainder time first id like address suggestion per se rule offense dependent service connected i believe case toth v quarles court pointed purpose military fight wars things tend detract and i would say offenses dependents held service connected thats going seriously detract militarys primary purpose fighting wars i mean obviously think cases even removed military interest discipline military well justice scalia i think really constitutional issue i mean obviously limits congress authority expand court martial jurisdiction thats correct but constitutional arguments made and i believe court would evading duty deferred military courts exceed court martial jurisdiction particular case thank much,254.0,319,24,we hear arguments first morning no 851581 solorio united states mr bruce may proceed whenever youre ready were speaking alleged alaska offense not new york ones had alaska authorities indicated interest prosecution but particular victims fathers longer well say historic disapproval i mean ocallahan decided 68 69 departure virtually century precedent there disapproval prior ocallahan well certainly country look cases ocallahan impliedly overruled court well get historic disapproval country disapproved before ocallahan well think early cases court didnt properly reflect view founding fathers i think statement theres historic disapproval country simply isnt supported early cases i mean ocallahan sharp departure precedents court i think mr bruce could give another example one would consider closest threshold question whether court jurisdiction matter determined basis 21 factors i assume theyre exhausted is comparable area law weve gotten kind fix dont even know court supposed dispose matter engage kind balancing test youre talking xxx speaks military interest many words but dont dont really say do find words military interest ocallahan or word balance so dont i take youre urging must finding military discipline disturbed interfered but essential well essential thats question well thats i really asked well restatement service connected language ocallahan narrowing broadening ocallahan xxx offsenses occurred base would court martial jurisdiction even though victims and right what victims related military personnel is base factor alone enough i mean i thought base factor one 12 may xxx divided argument amicus either amicus going address portion solicitor generals brief urges agree factors relford met overrule relford ocallahan because amicus going address id like talk thank mr bruce well hear mr fidell well thats good policy argument made congress we wouldnt saying know must done way wed saying constitutional matter permissible now congress agrees military expend energies something else takes stroke pen the argument youre making isnt constitutional one you mean constitutional matter military spend energies fighting war thank mr bruce the case submitted,956.0,940,4,in case thank mr chief justice may please court in case petitioner convicted preying sexually young daughters fellow

ocallahan test amply satisfied the argumentation petitioner amici taken us far afield simple truth case particularly make rather heavy weather relford decision 21 criteria and i think miss point relford represented law relford came along shock system ocallahan represented relford decided two terms ocallahan performed signal clarifying service laying categorical per se rule offenses service members base serious offenses subject court martial jurisdiction so per se categorical rule thats principal effect relford now order justify explain rule give guidance relford court said that per se rule marked area perhaps limit order give guidance court lay dawn addition 21 factors what petitioner amici due overlook fact relford laid categorical per se rule sort seek and suggest case requires courts solve system equations 21 unknowns jurisdiction seems turns relford head we urge first individual facts second categorical matter case cases like involve serious depradations military defendants members armed services admitted within limits set relford done per se rule relford set first noted relford status victims persons connected armed forces military defendant specifically mentioned court second would think anomaly concerned integrity topographical limits command overlook fact integrity command integrity organization people but justice scalia pointed petitioners argument looming problem base drug offenses this drug case sure but issue court military appeals trottier decision 1980 creates categorical rule base drug offenses little exception improper understanding courts jurisprudence if successful approach drug offenses military cast doubt kind procedure complex eschewing kind categorical approach petitioners urge court today finally urge court fulfill work relford returning law it announced landmark decisions reid v covert toth v quarles kinsella singleton throughout whole history constitution service membership service sufficient condition court martial jurisdiction we indeed justice blackmun we think returning status argument announced cases like reid toth kinsella greatly concerned civil liberties issues concern petitioners going back rule would violent unsettling law it ocallahan it would overrule ocallahan relford started process narrowing ocallahan substantial way because set per se categorical rule base offenses service members and point ocallahan pull one thread think bad thread fabric would require unravelling fabric law there one decision since ocallahan court considered service connection decision relford considerable narrowing i would say taming ocallahan and indeed it seems justice scalia make enormous difference because talking esprit sense comradeship supposed obtain within military services so preying upon dependents fellow service members addition pretty deplorable offense offense relation trust comradeship supposed obtain within military services indispensable condition kind morale trust supposed obtain among people serve ships together whose lives depend exact performance duty it seems that comradeship important factor irrelevance and judge court military appeals thats best answer i offer it thought powerful one courts stealing comrades aggravate offense indeed implicate concerns military argument submitting correct justice scalia it noted matter great importance ocallahan decision terms least obsolete ocallahan tried although case decided 59 68 term ocallahan tried 1956 1950 uniform code military justice that code twice revised since ocallahan tried important changes occurred 1969 1983 the important changes first remove organizationally terms evaluation military judge defense counsel command designation convening authority they convening authority longer picks military judge ocallahans time longer picks defense counsel that taken hands furthermore i would think i would think however ocallahan indeed depend description military justice system simply correct description military justice system obtains it may justice scalia rule propose preocallahan rule status reinstated aspects military justice system would subject review jurisdictional grounds due process grounds indeed question command influence significantly address congress regulation since ocallahan tried issues brought court recently yesterday court denied certiorari cases raising issue so ocallahan

review determined service connection case according i would call intermediate ground ask court say categorical rule dependency status there ex post facto objection raised court military appeal objection therefore seems us issue properly waived and able discover petitioners argumentation response point thank you,97.0,148,10,the military judge however found otherwise was base alaska off base alaska base new york but new york offenses issue you want go back old status argument it would merely overrule ocallahan relford course general fried go constitutional point lets assume stand relford i dont understand think affects military discipline morale lets say im officer base i learn another officer enlisted man matter child molester now i understand might affect military discipline morale but i dont know would affect i found moreover child officer enlisted man molested military child base somewhere else why would incremental affect whatever upon morale unit i mean fact child molester unit i understand but difference make child child another serviceman so hes thief doesnt steal comrades thats enough what change back do change constitutional interpretation go back ocallahan did intend address ex post facto argument thank general fried mr bruce two minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,527.0,748,3,mr chief justice may please court first i may respond briefly question justice blackmun raised commander bruces presentation on page 57 joint appendix stipulation indicates coast guard determine court martial without jurisdiction prosecute alaska offenses district attorneys office would reconsider decision prosecute so theres sense case state washed hands matter its simply waiting see outcome there submit reasons reconsider ocallahan relford cases there three possibilities might lead court conceptual matter reconsider one prior decisions one would example proved historic data earlier decision predicated incorrect incomplete the government pointed nothing case cast doubts historical materials presented earlier and know nothing add court ocallahan decided a second factor might lead court reconsider prior determination would test proved unworkable but also case respect ocallahan relford decisions the ocallahan relford decisions though theyve generated decisions decisional law military article iii courts presented substantial problem that question obviously always table mr chief justice and yet i would submit decision wrong certainly clearly wrong would lead court overturn precedent i think clearly wrong but may i dont think clearly wrong i dont think wrong fact i think court good ground and i frankly think subsequent history proven courts judgment profoundly wise matter not quite justice scalia the position court military appeals respect drug offenses obviously case theres nothing record drug offenses effect drug use performance duty so really appropriate vehicle get i think appropriate vehicle but position court military appeals varied years basically i read precedents membership court changed for time per se rule beaker case overruled 1976 there subsequent rule at moment rule 100 percent drug case theres service connection for awhile departed well congress taken matter hand might different question but havent taken hand wasnt appropriate fact appropriate i think yes thats correct but i would quarrel assumption substantial problem terms understanding parameters ocallahan decision relford decision say well point court military appeals military courts grappling the law grows the military courts sense different court constitution grows decisional matter increasing experience learned example science toxicological aspects drug use i feel somewhat uncomfortable discussing case drug case i dont think okay i think understand one another youre think i think justice white lockwood case and problem lockwood chain events began case larceny wallet base larceny use government identification card so far problem court military appeals case its said case gives us lot trouble and i think train went tracks terms ocallahan relford analysis that beginning substantial confusion ocallahan relford said indeed i dont think confusion i dont think theres confusion it takes page half manual courts martial president furnish restatement law service connection its confusing area it pretty much established 1970 particularly regards specific narrow issue case is enough victim happened dependent id need time laughter but problem problem justice scalia might last clear chance laughter id like point cut anomalies flow decision court military appeals for example im referring notion nonbase base less base coast guard juno greater district commanders responsibility personnel thats irrational outcome or make difference look example danger morale make difference purposes military jurisdiction whether victim dependent member coast guard dependent member navy many towns navy towns coast guard towns or make difference victim dependent member coast guard assigned unit morale issue wouldnt take place and indeed id like draw courts attention another point joint appendix there testimony page 101 would reputation coast guard enhanced coast guard turned individual charged alaska state authorities and answer government witness i think would yes and thats answer problem if concern people coast guard going feel angry lets call shipmates even though work federal building going escape punishment would one thing but theres issue what people according witness want want make sure coast guard going assist local authorities primarily jurisdiction law order community thats offenses juno took place and problem somebody misled district attorney thinking might court martial jurisdiction maybe wouldnt prosecute case disservice done district attorney and disservice thats easily remedied i would like i moment comment briefly bouie marks issue suggest solorio deprived two things value decision court military appeals number one deprived complete defense court martial court military appeals changed rules number two us alaska separate sovereigns punishment additive cumulative the consequence net punishment solorio exposed exposed increased and black letter violation ex post facto analysis i would also comment theres notion reliance interests frustrated reliance plays role submission issue suppose example accused ignorant subjectively ignorant punishment particular offense thank chief justice rehnquist and offense committed thereafter legislature changed penalty can question that violates ex post facto clause thank you,125.0,181,5,well one reason reconsider ocallahan would simply felt wrong matter constitutional law and course questions open it clearly wrong rather wrong overrule mr fidell say hasnt created decision problems the briefs address problem drug offenses and i gather court military appeals taken position drug offenses automatically related wherever occur forth right not moment well heres problem ocallahan relford constitutional decisions every case decide jurisdictional question basis rational line it much affect military forth thats difficult process fact bound now said isnt matter constitutional law congress congress doesnt want stuff military courts take adopt clear line says drug offenses tried military personnel tried military courts one cannot arrive clear lines constitutional interpretation question jurisdiction extent possible ought clear well couldnt take hand tell tell constitutional point i dont know i would particular drug offense and i think difficult say constitutional matter whether drug offenses it seems hard point xxx forgery fraud cases well could restate law torts know couple lines laughter that doesnt make clear xxx anything reasonable man wouldnt laughter youre using colleagues rebuttal thank mr fidell well hear general fried,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,14,8,66.0,157.0
37,2012.11-345,Fisher v. University of Texas,11-345,1349845200.0,1372050000.0,Abigail N. Fisher,"University of Texas at Austin, et al.",7.0,1.0,1,1404.0,2222,53,mr chief justice may please court mr chief justice general suter trained well mr chief justice members court may please court the central issue whether university texas austin carry burden approving use race admissionsplus factor consequent denial equal treatment central mandate equal protection clause abigail fisher met two tests strict scrutiny applicable first well justice ginsburg first injury court use system denied equal treatment it constitutional injury part damage claim premised directly constitutional issue lesage litigated merits question whether lesage could carry case  summary judgment apparent complaint was denied access graduate program university texas sustainable as i said  several factors case quite different first constitutional injury court recognized second fact premise could allowed circumstance never tested wasnt raised it comes footnote correct no thats correct your honor she  automatically admitted she considered summer program rejected you talking cap program could attended different university texas system able achieve she graduated well issue course bifurcated weve reserved ability well denial right equal treatment constitutional injury claimed certain damages we  started case clear whether would wouldnt admitted well theres well i think on  remand assert damages contingent upon fact admitted ut admitted would prove use race would admitted thats thrust lesage whether prove cant prove something cant tell record its merely asserted and i would point texas said way determine issue without no sir that correct first premise and i would say issue raised bakke and bakke contention couldnt gotten medical school therefore case the court said footnote 14 justice powells opinion thats matter merits matter standing i think parents involved type contention made respect louisville class plaintiffs whose son admitted school choice court said damages enough sustain standing there live damages claim i dont think question standing yes justice scalia i agree justice breyer said carefully trying change courts disposition issue grutter could legitimate compelling interest moving  using race establish diverse class what  problem weve encountered throughout case varying understandings legitimacy interest get necessary use race achieve interest critical mass we litigated basis yes well justice breyer argument satisfy grutter properly read what weve seen well i think would flaws grutter even assumed away something cant assumed away matter texas law top 10 percent program well i dont agree let explain in order satisfy grutter first say using race gratuitously interest producing critical mass otherwise underrepresented students and within grutter framework first question absent use race would generating critical mass to answer question start  youve got examine context socalled soft factors grutter you know  isolation campus do members minority feel cannot speak well survey  random survey its reported systematic way they evidently interviewed students and classroom isolation it wasnt it done president faulkner made declaration going it done on  i believe day no i dont im sure agree courts method analysis and  particularly case considering alternatives worked well i think thats legal question court free act so i might try answer question effort case establish even working target critical mass they simply ignored they used words said weve got so never answered predicate question grutter asks absent use race generate critical mass so  i mean thats flaw think grutter we think necessary court restate principle now whether no i and im  im saying justice scalia correct and addition courts didnt find whether critical mass well dont believe demographics key underrepresentation critical mass well i think start split subgroups minorities mistake i think i think proper thrust grutter least ought certainly  racial balance justice scalia racial balancing permissible interest constantly  court constantly held permissible interest and something certainly agree trying respond justice sotomayor framework grutter youre looking  person member socalled underrepresented minority  concept dont necessarily accept texass concept  isolated are unable speak and i think weve always said large number texas 2004 ostensibly made decision reinstitute race 21 percent admission percentage called underrepresented minorities they also 18 percent admission ratio asianamericans so campus youre talking  40 percent class minorities yes it said expressly grutter in grutter court assumed small number admissions minority admissions looked whole  looked whole whole grutter  would yielded 3 4 percent minority admission class 350 means 12 15 students we  burden establish number it burden university texas determine whether well allowed state grounds need proved always prove fairness justice sotomayor the question what saying brief generating fact substantial number minority presence campus and no and immediately thrust upon responsibility wanted  know essentially move away equal treatment establish purpose trying generate critical mass minorities otherwise could achieved and purpose put  put aside whether necessary whether appropriate last resort quest diversity critical mass grutters without limits but ill put aside let come directly question first think narrow tailoring cant tailor unknown if range evaluation understanding critical mass means cant tailor no theres huge difference important one well put university texas having range view would appropriate level comfort critical mass defined grutter allows evaluate well justice sotomayor i think important distinguish operative use range words thats going use race get every year consideration application problem this system doesnt  i mean narrowly tailored doesnt fit there certain forms grutter follows it well simply reiterated language grutter they definition they cant fit well let tell look outside top 10 socalled aipai admits  forget top 10 minute generating approximately 15 percent minority admissions outside top 10  target grutter so grutter facts its vastly different this no  im talking nontop 10 percent admissions 15 percent socalled underrepresented minorities this without top 10 now top 10 also major generator admissions underrepresented minorities that correct no with 10 percent plan much higher in 2004 21 percent hispanics african americans categories used if add asians 38 percent but im isolating  response justice ginsburg im isolating nontop 10 admissions those 15 percent year average close time so  total generation minority presence combination two fact aipai system  adopted response hopwood it  texas says first thing tried accommodate loss ability use race directly came hopwood so first response look balanced admission program academic index personal achievement index so system excludes minorities well question excuse justice kennedy well well well yes thats part the second question reasonably available alternatives if take texas word says satisfied happy going way apply race today tried measure well difference making could achieve thing reasonably available raceneutral alternative thats question asked grutter they supposed analyze they didnt look but the raceneutral alternative includes extension 10 percent plan major generator minority admissions and right ranges 30 percent well say but justice ginsburg let  let say  lot speculative there nothing record support we dont know theyve never surveyed top 10 admits minority admits see well correct correct yes and even fifth circuit said cant disregard consequences matter law im simply saying could choose extend beyond capped today 75 percent but thats option thats alternative and certainly one simple alternative could look yield percentage admitted minorities actually encouraging  enrolling no but justice justice breyer  i answer question id like reserve little time no i perfectly happy  answer question i think increase african american admissions youre looking pregrutter it generated 2004 so i want make clear record doesnt depend  dont depend race its minimal change use race and thats say alternative would serve well increasing yield indeed reweighting  pai critical element put emphasis socioeconomic factors less emphasis essays academic measure within pai so lots could its job court tell its job examine alternatives available see couldnt achieve thing i  question whether overwhelms theyre  say admit effective there admissions would taken place somebody else would place use race and i think justice kennedy answer question fully analyze raceneutral alternatives and look parents involved  critical question the  outcomes small readily available alternatives we argued continue argue it necessary okay under category  first category necessary means pursuing compelling interest dont believe theyve shown necessity and certainly  race last resort first resort thats nutshell prong and order  failed every respect if go narrow tailoring saying didnt consider alternatives treatment pointed asian americans hispanics makes  incomprehensible distinction they say dont worry asians lot asians demographic measure forbidden measure they excess share texas population but trying find individual comfort levels breaking african americans  hispanics there plus race there many factors decision and might i say  white student president class ethnically different school measure leadership leadership independent factor pai it isnt  getting point race hes getting point leadership that raceneutral criteria could work anybody so race independent addon something used boost pai score pas element way like say contextualize say necessary narrowly tailored ignores available alternatives treats  gives disparate treatment asian americans minorities well extent depends classroom factor simply way relate fit solution problem used major foundation proposal nondiverse classroom that  certainly correspondence i see time mr chief justice thank its the reason payment fee doesnt redress injury your honor would paid even texas didnt consider race therefore payment application fee back doesnt remedy injury complaining thank mr chief justice thats i expected well thats seeking case mr chief justice level playing field abby fisher so apt point theres three things i want touch first theres lot back forth standing pointed really relates merits and i want make clear accept premise footnote would entered circumstances theyve asserted fact considered summer program no said “ damages ” point writing and im saying never opportunity develop full damages the specific number complaint point time filed application fee believe you would paid fee return fair processing application receive think claim sustained it tested point and second thing way case bifurcated agreement district court well develop additional damages we reserved right amend things progressed no because  bio ut pointed kinds financial injuries ascertainable time complaint filed trying put university thats one things suggested there differences cost  paid lsu would paid ut im saying reserved questions dont go standing the court made clear bakke let go another issue know i think i never completed answer justice breyer where stand grutter follows we recognize words  solicitor general issued  interest cognizable diversity that  root question grutter could recognize but concerned seeing universities like ut many others read green light use race end point discernible target critical mass know circumstances reduced something reviewed and long dont cross two lines determinative points fixed quotas  “ quotas ” meaning fill quota exclusively deem underrepresented  okay we dont think thats way grutter intended grutter intended say area great caution using race raises kinds red flags use race make determination whether really interest critical mass  dialogue interchange educational interest well i think talking well saying theres  differentiated department physical education like separate college changed nature hypothetical well case remember factor causing assuming choice you critical mass students they choose major different things thats one problems classroom diversity concept they never asked question 40 percent students minorities small classrooms why happen statistically would say thats aberration you might ask question whats causing because order fit no because dont take account interests dont ask going join rotc dont ask going major  major physics and comes time ut system allocate access different majors way basically premised academic index so twotiered admission system they focused  preference goes admission doesnt go sorting people majors and i might say justice breyer i think answer see ut  grutters  know perceived green light go ahead use race race otherwise really highly questionable abominable kind sorting that unchecked use race think  spawned misreading grutter needs corralled so well i mean two different questions the harvard plan different world its plan wholly individualized admission comparing individuals one one establish platonic ideal class educational mission this going ut this individualized i look i score i score individually but keep saying point admission i admitting people i admitting categories boxes relates justice alitos question i thought hypothetical justice alito entirely fair way system pai scoring figure two people would pai score race its addon it allows boost pas component pai score so  infrequent there many many candidates score pai may even ai boost now ut says well dont boost minorities and  stood today said briefs want boost ones like we want affluent minorities think improve view dialogue that contrary indeed fact give points system socioeconomic disadvantage its odds but purely race comes ultimate question chief justice asking where end point if nothing gauge success program cant even say beginning dont critical mass dont know refuse say judicial supervision strict scrutiny end point so said comes right back justice breyer would write clarify say grutter properly applies requires a b c  weve said brief would satisfactory but extent surviving side side could enormous confusion well im saying clarify needs necessity point look deficiencies clarify  consideration reasonably available alternatives necessity attribute  attribute weaknesses texas program absence factors i think fashion result case may may quote “ overrule ” grutter its really matter  want clearly restate allows use odious classification thats talking narrow window stated narrow window excuse well justice sotomayor i dont want gut and way one could reach conclusion assume grutter unlimited mandate without end point use race satisfaction deferred use race that unacceptable that invasion abigail fishers rights equal protection law thank you,1115.0,1558,64,well i get say case number 11345 fisher university texas austin and get say mr rein get court supposed raise the question standing the injury  injury rejection university texas answer matter person would accepted injury caused affirmative action program how get past texas v lesage injury says mere use race cognizable injury sufficient standing can i go another side shes graduated she disclaimed desire application go school she permitted apply summer program get automatically didnt correct but shes graduated injunctive relief shes going get so measure damages get entitled but claim injury whats injury youre claiming would sustain claim damages you still havent answered lesage gets away theres  give another damages question what damages weve cases involving alleged discrimination state  state contracting havent required person discriminated race prove would gotten contract otherwise its  enough denial equal protection her claim necessarily would  would admitted denied fair chance admission lottery just person denied participation contracting lottery suffered injury if going merits i want know whether want us  asking us overrule grutter grutter said would good law least 25 years i know time flies i think nine years passed and and overrule case much thought effort went many people across country depended so question whether  point case satisfy grutter is youre arguing well want argue right next ten minutes im interested i short time get question i need know going argue may i ask specifically lets take away 10 percent solution suppose plan one court 10 percent this exclusive way university attempting increase minority enrollment then 10 percent solution grutter would plan acceptable well question but seems program certainly aggressive one grutter  fact modest the one social studies university said minority students overwhelmingly even numbers feeling isolated so  isnt even test we go back whether substantial evidence adequate necessary why test fail was done announced decision reinstitute racial quotas which came almost immediately decision grutter and way think grutter  goes justice breyers question  think grutter held affirmative action higher education 2028 was holding grutter i agree might i want get question see im trying pinpoint limited time and one thing i want pinpoint since youre arguing satisfies grutter properly understood say in looking twocourt rule and two courts found seems that certain  quota it individualized it time limited it adopted consideration raceneutral means each applicant receives individual consideration race become predominant factor so i take given and i want know precisely grutter required opinion makes different grutter satisfied the ones i listed two courts say so maybe theres others but rule two courts say reluctant something connected facts overturn so  thats i mention there facts facts arent that  thats normal fact accede twocourt holdings whether is critical mass its weird kind fact its estimation isnt a judgment so could tell critical mass im looking number blacks university texas system pregrutter state indisputably still segregating 4 percent today postgrutter system 6 percent the 2 percent increase enough even though state population 12 percent somehow theyve reached critical mass 2 percent increase no  putting aside  i dont  im going quarrel demographics alone used i would somewhat concerned but cant seriously suggest demographics arent factor looked combination isolated isolated student body actually reporting feel it might  might insulting to thrown pot why  dont seriously suggest why dont seriously suggest demographic  demographic makeup state nothing whether somebody feels isolated youre state 1 percent black doesnt mean youre isolated long theres 1 percent class i wish would take position seems right but test  test opinion  i write opinion say  proper test critical mass is minority isolated unable speak thats test and wasnt grutter grutter and opinion grutter isolated all right and reason satisfied so telling us standard critical mass at point district court university know doesnt equalize desegregation happened particular state decades going stuck fixed number change rules whats fixed number well told  told district court they took study students they analyzed composition classes determined educational judgment greater diversity said grutter goal educational program one includes diversifying classes so proof require well given evidence think needed i think i hear saying brief numbers fixed got enough necessary thats enough thats youre saying tell  tell use race fit narrow tailoring necessity prong youve defined narrow tailoring grutter required how race used way violated terms grutter assuming need i know youre challenging need so set quota critical mass so wont call quota well call goal something grutter said shouldnt boy sounds awfully like quota grutter said shouldnt setting goals shouldnt setting quotas setting individualized assessment applicants tell system doesnt mr rein understand university texas thinks definition critical mass because i dont mr rein seems talking critical mass relying entirely 10 percent enough they dont  got minorities 10 percent dont need and i tried get rigidly focus  forget 10 percent plan this entire plan because 10 percent and  adoption plan well im sorry now im confused i thought 15 percent figure one arrived 10 percent plan could comment i hope get back justice alitos question you argue universitys raceconscious admission plan necessary achieve diverse student body admits people minorities and i trouble reading brief i said well whats problem then  lets assume resulted admission many minorities then youd come back say oh well  shows probably wrongly excluded i i see inconsistency is  saying shouldnt impose hurt injury generally little benefit point but  raceneutral alternative 10 percent plan but say thats okay  raceneutral really i mean  reason instituted 10 percent plan increase minority enrollment and  way works heavily separated schools and worse i mean  want go university texas 10 percent plan go lowperforming school dont take challenging courses thats youll get 10 percent so maybe university concerned that inadequate way deal excuse the 10 percent plan imposed university its option say  good education people take easy courses its imposed state law isnt anybody top 10 percent school state gets university texas or could  underlying thing i want get directly answer i look figures and hopwood 10 percent plan looked african american side averaged 5  5 percent per year really pretty steadily then hopwood 10 percent went little bit lot went 3 half percent 4 percent maybe and introduced grutter back 5 percent okay now lot is little there several thousand admissions officers united states several thousand universities going say wasnt already said grutter isnt going take hundreds thousands people federal judges dictating policy admission universities you see im looking certainty i saw happened saw numbers sorry go ahead you answer later want answer dont laughter uhhuh so going tell universities run weigh qualifications could tell race use race overwhelms factors system created well perhaps could summarize saying  telling us point view plan fails strict scrutiny one two levels objective inappropriate ill defined b implementation defective which arguing and respect plan fail strict scrutiny either  categories counsel one brief assumed valuing different races differently but asian numbers gone however structured pai and i understand position race balanced issues like socioeconomics strength classes people took its never stand alone so even white student i presume goes entirely black entirely latino school becomes class president would get points has proven foster deal diverse environment thats i understood plan giving plus race combining factors we afford rebuttal time since questions prevented reserving mr garre but  pay admissions fee process treated fairly can i ask get  easy dont i wanted use accurate numbers i discovered  i wanted find many universities actually used gruttertype process last year year etcetera and one amici admissions officers according library place information though public i didnt want amici and sides agree  simply roughly  number i would like know otherwise i  i use pregrutter numbers public available just keeping playing field level is complaint limited injunctive relief return 100 as written limited in arizonans alvarez said   damages speculative is actually see i said injunctive relief return 100 in in arizonans alvarez said cant manufacture standing fact did ask injunctive relief 100 specifically and would paid matter system admission would paid 100 for nominal damages and get around arizonans she going get better job went different university you suggesting every minority student got university got physical education program particular university  physical education program includes star athletes every star athlete school happens black hispanic asian something else reached critical mass 10 15 20 percent  university situation couldnt use race in holistic way grutter permits no every one students happens minority going end program you dont think university could consider needs different diversity departments arent saying thing say looking holistic measure looking student  minority student nuclear scientist is unchecked harvard plan  started 1978 decided justice powell is different race used military academies so want go read back wrote grutter go look underlying determinations critical mass go look exactly done texas  i charts help see  i find enough difference i write words administered 2000 3000  thousand federal judges try deal programs like  thats point right so dont want overrule grutter want gut you want gut you dont want overrule want gut now want tell universities reach certain number cant use race anymore thank counsel counsel the case submitted,822.0,1523,41,thank mr chief justice may please court for two overriding reasons admissions plan constitutional courts precedents first indistinguishable terms operates taking race account one modest factor among many individualized considerations applicants totality plans court upheld grutter plans court approved bakke harvard plan thats right thats second point i going make holistic admissions process issue necessary counterpart states top 10 percent law works systematic  offset systematic drawbacks law achieving interest indisputably compelling universitys interest assembling broadly diverse student body your honor multiracial box students check boxes based determination this true common application then would check box your honor true your honor  would make selfdetermination your honor if anyone part application violated honor code could come i dont think  i dont think would your honor i dont think that issue would different plan upheld grutter harvard plan bakke we your honor college america ivy leagues little ivy leagues im aware your honor way that determination made situation im aware race taken account the persons selfidentify form they your honor every year people many applicants admitted no your honor let try clear the university never asserted compelling interest specific diversity every single classroom it simply looked classroom diversity one dimension student body diversity this court grutter your honor maybe important thing said first 30 minutes given opportunity challenge grutter i understood friend ask court overrule this court grutter recognized obvious fact classroom one important environments educational benefits diversity realized university texas determining whether reached critical mass looked classroom along well your honor they study your honor took account considerations discussing enrollment categories well your honor supplemental joint appendix your honor student lists classroom the student lists no your honor of course classroom university knows students taking classes one want gauge diversity classrooms go back your honor part that information available university your honor race students theyve checked application but i want clear classroom diversity study this one many information points university looked well your honor first i think 200 number erroneous there many minority candidates no  perclass basis i think looking classrooms your honor university found shocking isolation your honor didnt look specifically determination what  words try find whether holistic admits percentage admits conclude 2004   classroom study plan issue adopted time holistic admits taking race account and concluded simply  looked african americans example 90 percent classes common participatory size yes your honor we your honor but time your honor time your honor i dont know answer question let try explain university didnt look specifically because time classroom diversity study conducted holistic admissions process issue adopted 20032004 and determination wouldnt important finding african americans hispanics underrepresented minorities present university numbers experiencing racial isolation classroom your honor dont one and court grutter to look criteria court grutter this court grutter specifically rejected notion could come fixed percentage now it certainly contextual i think could vary your honor i think  let first say friends throughout litigation court asserted 20 percent critical mass thats lumping together different minority groups no its its looking educational benefits diversity campus i think actually agree means grutter said meant terms let make couple points your honor first looked numbers  dont think numbers looked numbers 7 years racial diversity among groups university texas remained stagnant worse 2002 african american enrollment actually dropped 3 percent thats one part the part look admissions top 10 percent plan taking top 10 percent racially identifiable high school may get diversity looks okay paper doesnt guarantee diversity produces educational benefits campus and thats one considerations university took account well because your honor true group harvard plan court approved bakke specifically recognized would want representatives different viewpoints individuals within  racial group would individuals outside anyones experiences grew situations  experience lives going affect viewpoints your honor i think directly impacts educational benefits diversity sense minority candidate shown  succeeded integrated environment shown leadership community service factors looked holistic review precisely kind candidate thats going come  come campus help break racial barriers work across racial lines dispel  stereotypes 1998 your honor but respect factual point thats absolutely wrong your honor if look admissions data cite page 34 brief shows breakdown applicants holistic plan percentage plan and i dont think seriously disputed case point although percentage plan certainly helps minority admissions large  minorities admitted tend come segregated raciallyidentifiable schools no your honor and let  let answer question first example comes almost word word harvard plan court approved grutter justice powell held bakke because your honor point is want minorities different backgrounds we go way recruit minorities disadvantaged backgrounds no your honor counts different experiences well your honor want different experiences going  going come campus no your honors  race its opposite i mean luac decision example court said failing take account differences among members race disservice its  members racial group your honor bringing different experiences and say  took racial group admissions process tended admit  people particular background perspective would want people different perspectives and thats  thats interests discussing its interests harvard plan specifically adopts lays your honor  courts precedents say critical mass environment students underrepresented well your honor question course implicates grutter and i understood friend challenge they havent challenged diversity compelling interest what  look think courts review determination one look feedback directly students racial isolation experience do feel like spokespersons race thats one things looked your honor thats one things looked another look enrollment data showed example among african americans african american enrollment university texas dropped 3 percent 2002 percentage plan well i think agree 3 percent critical mass its well beyond when environment african americans your honor part  judgment admin  educators going make would look criteria no your honor you would look criteria looked enrollment data feedback students we also took account diversity classroom we took account racial climate campus your honor i dont think would i mean concept critical mass isnt tied demographic its undisputed case pursuing demographic goal thats page 138 joint appendix all  i think many key facts undisputed its undisputed race modest factor its undisputed taking race account consider individuals totality i think standard would apply one set forth grutter comes justice powells opinion bakke would look whether university reached environment members underrepresented minorities african americans hispanics feel like spokespersons race members  environment crossracial understanding promoted environment benefit  educational benefits diversity realized and reason university texas concluded that environment met laid several different information points court review your honor dont read grutter establishing kind time clock we looking well your honor grutter courts precedence were guided at least advocates and  would look  looking every year looking carefully and reach point course going stop but also take well i dont know ive disagreed anything said it your honor first id point friends concessions consideration race increased racial diversity hispanic helps minority enrollment thats page 138 joint appendix secondly id point fact african american hispanics admissions increase african american admissions doubled period 2002 2004 so real important impact diversity university texas your honor common form thats used asian american also next form says country origin spelled your honor weve looked whether critical mass underrepresented minorities precisely grutter decision asks us i think  i make quick point jurisdiction im sorry no no your honor dont on page 389 we  wouldnt monitoring class i think one problems it your honor it one things no your honor it one things pointed dissent what im saying dont problem i dont think grutter majority didnt understand monitoring purposes reaching specific demographic well holistic factors taking account application theyre listed various points application that  true cover application if  could i make one point jurisdiction thank the fundamental problem jurisdiction first definitively cannot show injured consideration race thats pages 415 416 joint appendix makes clear ms fisher would admitted fall 2008 class university texas matter race yes your honor and i think and another part that comes brief opposition your honor goes relief requested the declaratory injunctive release  relief case began request fallen thats undisputed so thing live case request monetary damages that request page 79 joint appendix focused exclusively request return admissions fees and reason enough confer standing would paid admissions fee matter policy university admissions texas v lesage says that  injury sufficient backwardlooking case like monetary damages in jacksonville cases involved forwardlooking claims declaratory injunctive release people going go get contracts so texas university your honor answer jurisdiction reason its true bifurcated sense could go prove damages complaint makes doubt request monetary damages request admissions fees that  says explicitly and court said relief remedy injury suffered cannot bootstrap plaintiff federal court that essence redressability requirement that comes seal co case and reason your honor i dont specific numbers obviously ivy leagues little ivy leagues filed amicus briefs using and court recognized grutter best universities many best universities america using plans 30 years your honor one things university texas monitor racial climate campus it improve experience students campus i dont specific number people your honor  important part improving educational experience students university texas matter race thank your honor,631.0,1056,74,i  i put narrow tailoring category narrowly tailored way grutter said not necessity prong need prong not necessity prong i think argument centered counsel  i need figure exactly numbers mean should someone onequarter hispanic check hispanic box different box well i suppose person onequarter percent hispanic determination would im onequarter percent hispanic they would check box what oneeighth would violate honor code someone oneeighth hispanic says i identify hispanic check hispanic box you dont check way racial identification so know 15 percent african american  hispanic 15 percent minority you say way what way do selfidentify and decide you know  want critical mass school large class class how figure particular classes dont enough what somebody walks room looks see looks  looks asian looks black looks hispanic is done i dont know talking i mean either factor validly case isnt do look individual classroom diversity and decide classes diverse fine im asking how look classroom did require everybody check box somebody figure oh person looks 132nd hispanic thats enough what kind study yes doesnt explain go classroom classroom deciding many minorities there student lists classroom race identified students oh go back checked form thats yes question you go back checked application form deciding whether economics 201 sufficient number african americans hispanics well classroom diversity nontop 10 percent part plan classroom diversity my understanding university 5000 classes qualified small total number african americans hispanics admitted part plan challenged little 200 so   possibly tiny tiny amount increase classroom diversity per class individuals class how many  many nontop 10 percent members two minorities issue admitted class i really dont understand answer you know total number lets say african americans entering class right yes and know total number admitted top 10 percent plan if subtract a b youll get c right and value c per class what number what critical mass african americans hispanics university working toward so supposed tell whether plan narrowly tailored goal does critical mass vary group group does vary state state but could answer question what university texas  university texas think questions is critical mass university texas dependent breakdown population texas its mr garre could explain  i think trying  seems critical question case why didnt 10 percent solution suffice there substantial number minority members admitted result 10 percent solution why wasnt enough achieve diversity i dont understand why why doesnt what kind viewpoints i mean political viewpoints but nothing racial diversity i mean youre talking something else also kind likely included within 10 percent rule and incidentally 10 percent rule adopted well i thought whole purpose affirmative action help students come underprivileged backgrounds make different argument i dont think ive ever seen the top 10 percent plan admits lots african americans  lots hispanics fair number african americans but say well  faulty doesnt admit enough african americans hispanics come privileged backgrounds and specifically example child successful professionals dallas now thats argument if  applicant whose parents  lets say theyre  one partner law firm texas another one part  another corporate lawyer they income puts top 1 percent earners country  parents graduate degrees they deserve legup lets say asian white applicant whose parents absolutely average terms education income well answer question african american hispanic plus factor so youre saying counts race well thats necessary  thats necessary response justice alitos question you want underprivileged certain race privileged certain race so thats race but reason youre reaching privileged members race privileged representative thats race i counsel i understand job precedents determine use race narrowly tailored compelling interest the compelling interest identify attaining critical mass minority students university texas wont tell critical mass how i supposed job precedents say i i know say know youve reached critical mass grutter said logical end point use race what logical end point when i know youve reached critical mass so conduct survey ask students feel racially isolated and thats basis constitutional determination okay what others at level satisfy critical mass yes level satisfy requirement critical mass when  i supposed decide whether environment within particular minorities dont feel isolated so i see  tell thats good enough but would 3 percent enough new mexico bordering state african american population around 2 percent mr garre i think issue colleagues asking point stop deferring universitys judgment race still necessary thats bottom line case and youre saying i think rightly cases cant set quota thats cases say cant so going set quota think standard apply make judgment but holds  another 16 years right sixteen years youre going call but youre appealing grutter thats said mr mr garre some stuff grutter says  stuff grutter says agree stuff says dont agree mr garre time  runs point id like answer argument based parents involved gain small warrant using racial criteria once 10 percent dont need so answer argument small well terms diversity justify lumping together asian americans do think  critical mass filipino americans cambodian americans cambodian americans but critical mass subgroups fall within enormous group asian americans if i could get suppose  experience identify numerical category numerical standard numerical designation critical mass its x percent during course admissions process admissions officers check see close coming numerical you  cannot but isnt happened grutter allowed so saying grutter incorrect im  im asking whether could and they dont  dont monitor race one holistic factors appears cover every application right im sorry the question whether race one holistic factors appears cover every application we give little time since im going give friend little time just clear arguing doesnt standing article iii sense you address brief one footnote right we obligation consider every case gave us one footnote said hard see could establish cognizable jurisdiction what  jacksonville case said injury forced part process raceconscious evaluation i thought friend  friend told us remedial issues damages issues segregated process still available remand well thats part injury suffered its  injury perhaps why shouldnt get money back since asking questions curiosity i curious know many  ambitious racial program university texas how many people affirmative action department university texas do idea there must lot people know monitor classes assessment race throughout thing there would large number people job wouldnt wouldnt suddenly went 10 percent how many people you dont thank counsel general verrilli,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,472.0,740,8,mr chief justice may please court in resolving case important focus precisely issue petitioner challenging grutters reaffirmation principle justice powells opinion bakke student body diversity compelling interest justify consideration race university admissions colleges universities across country relied principle shaping admissions policies vital interest united states continue able the core interest ensuring nations universities produce graduates going effective citizens effective leaders increasingly diverse society effective competitors diverse global markets i understand differently justice alito heres understand going respect admissions process university texas i going address directly i think needs bit context the top 10 percent plan certainly produce ethnic diversity significant numbers get the problem university cant control diversity way respect 25 percent class admitted holistic process so understanding university looking universities generally looking circumstance grant preference privilege make individualized decisions applicants directly educational mission for example look individuals play racial stereotypes bring the african american fencer hispanic  mastered classical greek they also look people demonstrated track record no i think i think i think  automatic preference texas and i think right  says page 398a joint appendix   describe process saying an applicants race considered extent applicant viewed holistically contribute broader vision diversity desired university  right but point i disagree justice scalia what  texas i think made clear  i think common feature kinds holistic approaches  everyone underrepresented group gets preference gets plus factor right there may racial preference situation its going depend holistic individualized consideration applicant i dont think tiebreaker i think functions subtly justice kennedy it make difference it doesnt invariably make difference respect every minority applicant thats key yes but doesnt necessarily make difference situation justice alito posited that  exactly right justice ginsburg point mechanical factor now respect implementation  narrow tailoring inquiry respect universitys implementation  compelling interest i think clear although petitioner says shes challenging implementation plan meets every requirement grutter addresses concern justice kennedy raised dissent grutter whether texas address concern theres quota everyone competes everyone else race mechanical automatic factor its holistic individualized consideration and way process structured monitor racial composition ongoing basis thats correct they make specific individualized judgments applicant yes but key mr chief justice way makes difference and makes difference casting accomplishments individual applicant particular light potential individual applicant particular light what  universities looking principally respect individualized consideration individual going contribute campus and race bearing bearing evaluating theyve accomplished bearing reasons i tried identify earlier justice alito bring table bring freshman seminar bring student government bring campus environment not necessarily laughter because   im trying make simple point neither neither might get sure our  military effectiveness depends pipeline wellqualified wellprepared candidates diverse backgrounds comfortable exercising leadership diverse settings right no justice alito the point educational diversity point university texas trying achieve create environment everyone develops appropriate sense citizenship everyone develops capacity lead racially diverse society benefit every rotc applicant university texas and 43 percent officer corps comes rotc its significant source military leadership i dont think critical  i agree friend critical mass number i think would illadvised suggest numerical may i answer mr chief justice thank i think  i dont think situation court simply affords complete deference universitys judgment hasnt yet achieved level diversity needs accomplish educational mission i think court ought  make independent judgment i think way court would go making independent judgment look kind information university considered that could information composition class it could information classroom diversity it could information retention graduation rates it could information  thats specific universitys context history is university history racial incidents trouble a series factors and courts got satisfy university substantiated conclusion based  based information considered needs consider race advance educational goals grutter identified compelling interest and i say i think number minority enrollees gets higher burden university going get harder meet but i dont think  i dont think number i dont think would prudent court suggest number would raise exactly kind problem i  i think justice kennedy identified grutter dissent creating hydraulic pressure towards number i agree i agree i agree critical mass  idea critical mass taken life way thats helpful doesnt focus inquiry if i may add one word conclusion thank i think important your honors government country universities flexibility shape environments educational experience make reality principle justice kennedy identified parents involved strength comes people different races different creeds different cultures uniting commitment freedom perfect union thats university texas trying admissions policy upheld,308.0,531,12,does united states agree mr garre african american hispanic applicants privileged backgrounds deserve preference if two applicants absolutely every respect they come affluent backgrounds welleducated parents one falls within two groups given preference doesnt its marginal case its last  last position available class under texas plan one gets one doesnt get now agree do agree  agree that incorrect statement facts agree thats incorrect understanding equal protection clause yes  hypothetical two applicants entirely respects and  ability give racial preference means anything certainly mean  hypothetical given  given justice alito minority student gets one doesnt its matter everyone matter two identical respects and racial preference mean doesnt mean situation minority applicant wins one loses i dont understand argument i thought whole point sometimes race tiebreaker saying isnt well go away then  say cant use race dont worry it doesnt function subtly every case we findings courts  im reading court appeals opinion petitioner appendix page 33 the district court found race indisputably meaningful factor make difference evaluation students application  if doesnt make difference clear case theyre using race way doesnt make difference the supposition race determining factor weve heard lot holistic thats fine but unless determining factor cases theyre using race doesnt serve purpose that cant situation you agree makes difference cases okay but thats  would true  bakke plan cases going make difference the would true grutter the would true policies existence military academies general i think i take answer supposition justice alitos question truly impossible system there two identical candidates identical mechanical factors  except 10 percent plan under pia factors varied contextually set two applicants ever could identical sense hypothesize because two people to get back talking  i understand race taken account right thats thing cover application take race account and district court found  youre challenging  race makes difference cases right all right sir but correct answer justice alitos  ever two applicants gpa test  grades sa1 sa2 leadership activities awards work experience community service familys economic status schools socioeconomic status familys responsibility singleparent home languages english spoken home sat score relative schools average race situation  things absolutely identical person would admitted bounds race gentlemen dont write let withdraw hypothetical dont like before time runs let ask another question your rotc argument  make  make  devote lot attention brief military could explain rotc argument why important rotc program commissioned officers texas plan top top 10 percent plan oh i understand and  i dont want cut time expire youve got marginal candidate wants go university texas austin also interested rotc maybe race taken account candidate gets maybe isnt doesnt get how impact military the candidate probably go texas am texas tech is position inferior military officer went one schools then i dont understand argument general  view tell whether  university attained critical mass okay im hearing lot id like know responsibility decide whether use race narrowly tailored achieving universitys view critical mass oh yes we probably stop calling critical mass mass know assumes numbers either size certain weight so stop calling mass call cloud something like laughter sure thank general mr rein 10 minutes,-10,12,582.0,484.0

gannett company depasquale mr bernius may proceed whenever youre ready do place argument principally one amendment which prefer incidentally mr bernius transcript happened did trial judge time original order indicate transcript would would available case terminated   trial terminated has lodged us mr bernius the entire record lodged so answer entire record isnt right the record trial inaudible but entered plea trial stage began trying separate pretrial decided finally plead guilty wasnt pretrial covers things youve telling us exclusion public when  when said separate proceeding mean gannetts proceeding obtain release access suppression motion  new york law separate proceeding criminal proceeding and case gannett  title case gannett so nothing criminal case right what make part record application and attached exhibits whether  thats  or attached  incidentally i take stenographic transcript tape recording the proceedings inaudible 13 case thats proceedings right i mean  thing  happened motion 13 suppose criminal trial mr bernius  either prosecution defense wants take deposition absent witness either united states situated someway attendance personal attendance cant compelled would think sixth amendment arguments would require taking testimony witness public open hearing no criminal trial carefully stood trial  pretrial what never offered evidence common pretrial depositions civil criminal cases particularly judge present thats usually case many question youre asked answered reserved right challenge admissibility  asked deposition offered how part trial offered evidence well subsequent determination made never offered well  what court rule is circumstance what party called deposition decides isnt needed therefore doesnt offer suppose prosecution takes pretrial testimony abundance caution put case find approved  established facts witnesses never bothered put deposition evidence is part trial well sixth amendment speak terms proceedings speak terms trial well  whoa counsel statistic show 90 complaints prosecuting attorney never even prosecuted information indictment would make prosecuting attorneys conference among colleagues part trial way many cases disposed why framers cast language sixth amendment saying accused shall enjoy right public trial why didnt say press shall access trial well framers shouldnt taken odd way expressing meant adopt view well tell purposes served except reading clause mr bernius argue anyway dont independently sixth amendment public trial press least first amendment right present now get i know youre going argue i hope  public also first amendment right you dont claim   press public and first amendment sixth amendment when get cases court first amendment guarantees access information your honor  i believe i analogous case history first  theres question case public press right present prior motion exclude the court appeals indicated opinion respondents concede its  right present i think derives primarily right gather information recognized court branzburg i know right gather information without limits i would submit sort right gather information must exist trials must exist streets public forums i think purposes right gather information public forum test developed specifically articulated grayned case gives pertinent guidance would take far right present conference members appellate court why except i thought based approach little ago right gather information mr bernius primary function suppression hearing and court determines heard press heard evidence restriction press publishing it come attention jury so could primary function suppression hearing performed youre correctwell your honor  really i believe  one principle faults court appeals opinion assumption publication definition means  jury affected information what judge modified order expressly said determination trial transcript suppression hearing made available anyone wants then suppression information but dealing trial pretrial werent nebraska didnt  but  inaudible mr justice stevens suggested interest justice fairness require jury change evidence purpose served im sure quite fully answered purpose served jury hears indirectly if federal court would difficulty using change venue alternative defendant objected wouldnt what vicinage requirement well think government could said  case pending federal court dont worry supra  opening suppression hearing court going move change venue tennessee of course mr bernius defense lawyers move closure ground thought theyd prejudiced wasnt ground reason closed what sort showing would make open court without revealing thing wanted conceal right that fact confession made would disclosed wouldnt and would prejudicial defendant published press assert right publish whatever heard hearing well maybe case normal  every case isnt true press would know whether confession advance would you really think youre better judge whats good defendants trial posture counsel did say inaudible knew defense wanted suppress anything else oh i know know motion suppress identified  either must i suppose sought suppressed we dont know  theres nothing record tell us what im getting didnt  i know gun found michigan wasnt and hadnt papers already published suppression hearing but  knew confession  printed absolutely was voice overlap well would hearing i gather one protests shouldve hearing order closure issued   right and would argued well ground whatever subject motion suppress already published you said earlier mr bernius response justice stevens defendants right paramount i think words you mean  defendants right fair trial paramount well mr bernius suppose case hearing  issue confession judge says ive read confession newspapers media really job getting word apparently want theres going lot people hear and going make difficult get jury makes finding serious danger fair trial rights defendant i suppose take appeal wouldnt well i know wouldnt lie still i take i  i would like know kind findings  trial judge would  would accept well suppose makes well kind evidence kind danger would think would present  wouldnt present flat confession crime defendant interested media i take think  case least news and going  interested publishing result   went suppression hearing so youre innocent publishing confession one well wanted right publish anyway yes you want right publish and kind evidence would sufficient  judges conclusion real danger  we arent talking newspapers arent oh talking media talking television inaudible and doesnt good talk 1500 newspapers we talk television  reach television coverage dont well dont suppose wouldnt would open suppression hearing do think theyre going stay home mr bernius may i ask whether without prior hearing closure order sat  members public however many suppression hearing close judge issued order publish least jury chosen sequestered anything heard day similarly address order general public whoever present time youd still wouldnt on ground but  judge depasquale apparently anticipated answer mr justice brennan didnt mr kobroff,1244.0,1865,36,mr chief justice

 actual actual poison put community were situation mitigating damage thats already done thats already weve got situation damage isnt yet done the  isnt widespread opportunity stop inception the gun thats true might well  isnt alternative available court deal prejudicial publicity i mean fact sheppard measures might also used im voice overlap  well difficulty exclusion last alternative wait till

return gunshots heard anchors missing body decease corpse eyewitnesses crime never never found however theyre unsuccessful suppression motion defense almost hopeless the full confessions crime plus murder weapon evidence this case already generated extensive media publicity throughout seneca county i think accept i think also  oh your honor i  might  claim factual reports defense attorney trying case i mean would want accept factual reports these untested unreliable rumors alright the thing murphy confession confronting would possibly testified report press i think thats major distinction murphy on day suppression motion three reporters courtroom know petitioners reporter reporter geneva times reporter syracuse post together papers accounted us 85 daily newspaper circulation seneca county no none papers published seneca county geneva ontario county miles away the newspaper actually published seneca county weekly newspaper seneca county  oh  i believe waterloo an additional 6 daily newspaper circulation seneca county accounted petitioners ethical journal paper owns distributed there could doubt petitioner  no i want state make point fact would occurred hearing would widely immediately disseminated i think three newspapers well three reporters seneca county courthouse unless feel theres new story unless theyre going use thats reason fact circulation county greathouse jones moved exclusion media representatives they argued deleterious effects disclosures evidence sought suppress sought suppressed would outweigh right public trial well made motion suppress physical evidence the motions statements made michigan police fruits confessions lived voice overlap  well substance confessions published well i mean actual word confession hadnt used used inadmissible statements it would appear but nevertheless accused necessarily feel run risk see two reporters courtroom might continue up gotten substance confessions they knew  know reported police michigan interviewing suspects learn apparent motive slain so knew gotten something interviews didnt know day suppression hearing going find “motive” apparent slain right i would say thats exactly fact yes i think  they lot damaging evidence right its confession that would well i think case thats difference perhaps triable defense  yes i think could still make emotion well  i think defense counsel would certainly make motion i mean whether  the would threaten right get impartial jury county the  simply press information simply press publish doesnt mean defendant therefore stopped trying know  well  that might well  he might well i mean could well take consideration say well given situation i dont find threat i wont on hand might well say well yes im going im going  continue case youve waive right speak he might  might play whole instances things could even though information i assume saying shouldnt foreclose defendant judge power  means protecting defendants rights simply  well i would first say i think thats unlikely situation i think  statute ever enacted state legislature might well raise constitutional problems public ultimate sovereign the public   right know i think thats  i think  thats little different i think perhaps public trial   definition public trial well i meant  comparison executive closure cabinet meeting compared difference i think  yes yes i would also say though also public policy state new york every state societal interest advanced right public trial independent accused right public trial i think  two sources yes i believe ive cited brief yes its 308

those filed though no sealed i believe answer question i think source news seemed state police david inaudible referred various articles giving various quotes no the situation isnt i mean evidence admissible theres reason insolate jury theyre going hear anyway i ask questions  no i asked questions see exactly theyve read theyve read it might affected well i dont think i cause i might want

permissive judge depasquale could close obvious needles prejudice accused constitutional right occur he duty protect respondents greathouse jones right trial impartial jury county venue prudent judge would done i dont think could i think nebraska press pretty well decided issue thats available i mean  addition i think course  court even held nebraska press occurs public hearing   cannot prior  cannot subject prior restraint so option never even available far goes that seems rule certain confessions certain statements suppressed others apparently certain statements made requested attorneys statements made what involved case constitutional right accused trial impartial jury county venue right public including potential jurors media representatives immediate access pretrial evidentiary

wouldnt suffice well isnt trial judge yes made motions later did make  kind determinations make he   denied motions didnt and  and indicate mechanisms wouldnt sufficient what court appeals think happen normal case did think something happen addition happened trial court but gun already yes money  must exclusion however last alternative  was body ever found but make statement basing whats appendix this far different cases decided isnt  doesnt strike rather routine reporting factual reporting well comparing material murphy florida instance is geneva county inaudible seneca county where court sitting in seneca what town well statistics important mr kobroff identify wanted suppressed well yes i mean i know ive seen transcript but record us though well publication physical evidence found michigan right the  clear  gun found greathouse  led police reported reported defendants moved but say motion suppressed also addressed statements made michigan police oh yes given statements written confessions  and thered publication made statements the publication dealt fact new york police  listed  gave one statement greathouse made michigan police captured was afraid hed shot  i mean extent though already published  so merely substance confessions i understood friend say even though newspaper reporter knew published matter editorial judgment but also published probation san antonio that state police hoping bring pickup truck back theyre still looking 357 magnum revolver later found that everything confession well confession didnt published and im  im halfway thats thing isnt well mr kobroff would defending closure everything subject motion suppress already published what justification would closure everything   subject motion suppress voice overlap  im talking defense counsel im asking justification would order closure circumstance i dont suggest he make motion im asking judge would enter order closure   everything subject motion   even public knowledge counsel position solely protection defendants rights involved supposing new york legislature passed law saying trials criminal trials state shall closed unless otherwise required constitution united state defendant prosecutor agreed particular case trial closed they move forward stipulated is reasoning constitutional issue its rather would rather strange statute lets suppose enacted what sort constitutional problems well  what rule appellate court rule governor new york cabinet meetings going private rule president united states cabinet meetings going private well  well say definition public trial new york state legislature says going public trial yeah youre trial youre referring sixth amendment i take i know  argument defendants right i trying find jelke case new york court appeals do remember thats cited briefs you did judge case  voice overlap citation features 308 new york 56 is  did judge put limitation prosecutor others releasing statements confession voice overlap  does record show media found adjustments gun the motions made open court  references pistol motions open court i see but public records werent sealed do think threat fair trial rights defendant great admissible evidence published ahead time inadmissible well i know suppose know voir dire asked jury read case they say yeah weve read what defense counsel say   shrug shoulders well suppose one says i read verbatim transcript published paper suppression hearing turned  evidence admissible the  i understand correctly transcript suppression hearing available part public record but  sent yes i know collateral perhaps interest could how  see constitutional problems  judge depasquale say well press may stay public may stay and heard whole thing close said well maybe prejudicial and issues order directed press public present you dont think  would voice overlap  would fall within i think mr justice frankfurter said cat bag impossible get back what judges decision case admissibility but newspaper could publish would record transcript they couldnt draw nuances anything witnesses appeared yes voice overlap  obviuosly werent obviously you dont think thats necessary they wouldnt good would well two better one two better one  well record plus side witness two theyre still how written news story convey nuances youve discussing in different  differently written transcript television

public employees they process servers court attendants office sheriff cook county i argue behalf incident discharges threat discharge political consideration commonly described called patronage practice requesting political sponsorship either appointment certain public jobs continue employment public jobs in particular case plaintiffs respondents employees sheriff’s office december 1970 incumbent republican replaced democrat elrod elected prior month the plaintiffs job categories like others sheriff’s office protected civil service nonpolitical merit system job category they protected anyway contract agreement legislation summary discharge the plaintiffs stated case republicans originally obtained jobs sheriff’s office republican sponsorship republican officials order employed republican sheriff yes sir they alleged discharged republicans could would obtain democratic sponsorship continue jobs now complaint number allegations concerning practice discharging noncivil service employees cook county sheriff’s office assumption sheriff different political party would discharge employee didn’t pledge allegiance party new sheriff didn’t agree work party candidates party new sheriff would contribute portion wages party new sheriff would obtain political sponsorship new sheriff’s party now neither complaint affidavits case allege four respondents required even told might required meet conditions set forth practice political sponsorship condition i might add respondents referred court stipulation fact sheriff sheriff’s office companion case shakman case also seventh circuit we object statement facts operation sheriff’s office we feel fairly state factual situation sheriff’s office the district court denied preliminary injunction dismissed case failure state claim mr justice rehnquist stipulation sheriff’s office i think i describe summary quickly there 3000 employees sheriff’s office cook county about 500 fit kind large category includes types mentioning about 500 either supervisory unsponsored political person holdovers previous administrations almost affect career employees might well sponsored republican about 1300 employees  3000 employees protected legislatively created merit system this includes sheriff’s police corrections officers run county jail house corrections juvenile facility 1200  3000 patronage area appointed sponsored political figure party existing sheriff oh yes sir often happen yes sir that’s correct sir that correct yes sir political support expected respect patronage employees no sir specifically allegation complaint the requirement one supports democratic candidate sheriff reelection least likelihood become worker democratic party  that’s hard question answer mr justice rehnquist i think purposes argument purposes court’s decision patronage practice sponsorship would presume part sponsoring democrat man going worker generally democratic party in lower court district court judge power dismissed case basis alomar versus dwyer while pending appeal seventh circuit came illinois state employees union versus lewis republican secretary state effect done thing large number democrats took secretary state’s office i mention shakman case i say shakman case previously held the shakman case independent running constitutional delegate effect kind nonpartisan election shakman case argued major political parties patronage system republic employment voter candidate rights equal protection election attempt become constitutional delegate interfered so came slightly different context lewis case case alomar versus dwyer nevertheless related instance patronage system question so core issue case really specific one is first amendment prohibition elected public official discharging noncivil service employee failure obtain political sponsorship party elected official wishes perhaps different context respondents rights jobs conditioned political affiliation equivalent right free speech only seventh circuit court appeals ruled the second circuit said fourth circuit said dc circuit said this court recent years unequivocally held right political association absolute subject reasonable restriction limitation public interest letter carrier’s case buckley versus valeo court held this court i think important case consider companion case case upon respondents rely board regents versus roth the seventh circuit court appeals ruled nontenured teacher fired without reason given property interest job would generate due process rights now seventh circuit ruled the seventh circuit said entitled hearing this court said he nontenured teacher alleged first amendment rights violated fired reason given now  court ruled property interest would justify protection due process clause fourteenth amendment the argument must respondents nontenured nontenured employees contract agreement got job wellknowing since already receive jobs politically sponsored time  type job needed political sponsorship whether people right job political association like free speech interest individuals free speech overrode governmental interest might exist partisan political public service governmental interest could condition restrict right political association it seems respondents argue legitimate governmental interest least compelling governmental interest partisan political public service area articulated must strongly disagree position their position based type argument since courts including court agreed nonpartisanship public service public office circumstances legislative acts hatch act obvious campaign financing certain areas government good nonpartisan tenured securityoriented employee therefore necessarily political public service bad exactly mr justice exactly and case different level situation the illinois state legislature county board cook county legislatively acted say respect certain officers police corrections officers sheriff’s office merit in effect yes i think i replied briefly commented criticism respondents chief justice bell’s factual analysis suggested perhaps exchange sinned cast first stone  may wrong they the difference yes sir difference a state officer elected public official  political public office particular employees made part nonpolitical public service yes sir could they could they say appoint a democrat yes sir or republican governor oh no sir what say  any public official respect public jobs designated nonpolitical public jobs see  well let give state  state interest i think i think essential show state interest partisanship i think could say yes they could say “you’re fired” didn’t well said fired won’t switch help us politically party it mr justice white throughout history country distinguished european public service concept political public service crucial growth government  many reasons to growth good operation efficient operation government no operation government because human instinct well much mr justice marshall an elected public official  well political argument political argument  well political argument also good one extent sheriff elected people exercise management discretion exercise management discretion consisting commitment people elected people work loyal faith loyal faith intending encourage reelection political figure operation government that’s  well  well way comment lewis case policy making nonpolicy making i think  well way mr justice white i think include fallacy government local level run quarterdeck run engine room what government gives local area service people services sewers services court operations services summons takes care buildings runs transportation systems collects garbage keeps water pure yes sir we constitutional problem mr chief justice could many officers could eliminate the legislature could eliminate they haven’t yes sir freelancers way include policy makers mr justice white freelancers good way describe that’s way it’s always run way chicago mr justice rehnquist it happened throughout country’s history throughout country’s history now ordinarily talk policy making nonpolicy making mr justice white that’s get quarterdeck concept talk perquisite office elected executive the president united states i think jefferson instance came office one time said “well i think i’ll wait normal attrition jobs” said “few died nobody” – well say mr justice  i think  well i believe it’s essential efficiency government and it’s simply look plethora cases coming federal district courts way line question mr justice marshall happens civil service system shuts disadvantaged shuts minorities shuts aged shuts infirm requirements testing all country running problem fact don’t proper proportions society proper geographic distribution within voting districts civil service regulations the patronage system mr justice white way minority people country got saying record  pardon yes sir oh well record i’m sorry mr justice blackmun record i cannot i say civil service area public employment cases country indicating sufficient numbers minorities able get public service civil service system not record mr justice the civil service sheriff’s office county sheriff’s police corrections officers take care county jail house corrections juvenile court facility jurisdiction sheriff yes sir merit system employment the  categories include supervisory level police warden county jail majors supervisors divisions many court attendant’s process servers least for instance court attendants judges select sheriffs there’s political patronage involved although judicial patronage involved pardon oh yes as matter fact shakman case comments brief consent judgment there 103 defendants shakman case 103 republican committeemen defendants consented  shakman case elrod consented shakman case the chicago park district consented shakman case recently new governor illinois  recently new governor illinois argued consent decree predecessor governor apply by way he’s  doesn’t look like he’s going new governor long recently  didn’t win nomination but partisan political service mr justice white get back point it’s consensus is necessity consensus operate conceivable operation necessity loyalty by way i think mr justice stevens used good phrase he called necessity effective supervision employees employee know subject discipline doesn’t want must loyal endeavor convince people representations could job based political commitment well that’s correct i don’t think that’s interest i’m talking yes i mr justice white i say man elected people operate service government people elect exercise discretion sees fit one prerequisites discretion right appoint one things  well i think particular jobs  partly mr justice white certain types jobs simply subject political control historically firemen policemen highly tended become civil service legislatures yes sir since 1890 yes sir well that’s right legislature took away and took fbi away took cia away  legislature legislature right legislature right case didn’t and respondents asking asking court legislature i think necessity generating consensus mr justice white terribly important opportunity political official chance reelected continue progress i think terribly important mixture government political process i’d say that’s fair analogy mr justice burger no sir i know they way president’s power appoint used generate consensus program i’d like save couple minutes i could  i ran out ,458.0,579,43,we’ll hear arguments next number 1520 elrod burns they stated complaint can tell shakman case mr foran whether republican might employed tradition sheriff’s office democratic sheriff obtained democratic sponsor but theoretically possible least republican employee within 1200 democratic sheriff comes power could get sponsorship democrat could retained that’s record case shows   somebody terminated sponsorship came next day put back payroll but quid pro quo i gather reading record  along sponsorship comes obligation next election work democrat but change registration required well  i realize comes point probably stipulation doesn’t exhaust  doesn’t cover is also required support democratic candidate senator governor well democratic candidate sheriff but i would thought court said hatch act cases congress thought desirable by implication said respect rest “hed lived sword shall perish sword” suppose legislature illinois passed statute said democrats maybe employed sheriff’s office and difference  the legislation didn’t work but state officer but legislature couldn’t can governor a democratic governor could issue proclamation saying democrats work but county sheriff else besides county sheriff what state writ  case i take  seem say it’s essential find state interest you you don’t think  don’t think sheriff’s office illinois permitted say people “you’re fired we don’t need give reason all” they said firing belong wrong party and think you’re going say must find substantial state interest pretty strong one now what growth system you mean it’s essential elective process essential  to operation government why essential operation government it helps party that’s inaudible would enough protect interest drew line divided employees important obviously followed lead others  apparently legislature  legislature thinks way inaudible mr foran legislature illinois wanted could make 3000 employees sheriff’s office subject civil service could they could make sheriff barring provision constitution could make sheriff civil servant could and tell us   2800 people approximately 1800 rather 1800 freelancers 1200 subject civil service program well you’re going political organization city size chicago someone elected sheriff jobs give gets doesn’t well lots places i’m still waiting tell state history elevator operator republican rather democrat democrat rather republican do accept mr justice rehnquist’s statement essential twoparty system work this certainly isn’t essential government are saying record minorities shut taken system record could point specifically the civil service segment i’m zeroing noncivil service people i want know whether records constructed shows minorities others taken bland broad remarks would indicate what type jobs 1209 civil service people hold you mentioned janitors people provided various services line drawn civil service noncivil service employees are categories prescribed legislature is statewide illinois does system described apply statewide would springfield example well there’s practical reasons aren’t mr foran who’s going circulate sheriff’s nominating petitions i don’t know petition requirement illinois arizona every elected political officer couple political people staff make policy circulate nominating petitions things like how going embrace view it’s essential make elective process work you don’t seem want you want put operation government if important i’m surprised illinois legislature removed category important blocks employees those would ones would like know supporting “tooth toenail” for last 100 years all political appointees if want  you’d like unqualified support people office you’d like policeman serving people state yes i understand reason give seems considerably illuminated legislature illinois done i mean wouldn’t would frankly say party said elective process work party system work like parallel congressional staffs congressman picks staffs congressman senator defeated employment are civil servants working senator congressman very well mr tucker,1395.0,1821,23,mr chief justice may please court well i’m certain i answer directly i suppose would start back original federal civil service laws back period following assassination garfield civil service reform began 1800 1880s yeah 1880s yes sir however i think historical aspect case we’ve indicated brief correct patronage spoil system always part government since constitutional times whatever relevancy fundamental constitutional issues case i think really little dealing rights court declared it’s it’s anything new certainly recently declared core first amendment per curiam decision buckley because mr justice rehnquist i think court  court many years late 40s early 50s engaged considered right privileged distinction respect public employment said court substance said well right public employment therefore benefits come it’s purely matter discretion even require someone give constitutional rights however accept proposition mr justice stewart new proposition i supposed culminating mr justice stewart’s decision sindermann case certain things cannot require public employees there certain things cannot take away benefit one  yes sir well i don’t know whether register democrat i would say i objection policynonpolicy distinction court case mr justice stevens lewis case devised i objection i don’t think that’s thing balancing test respect fundamental constitutional rights however that’s different kind balance that’s  now moment i think distinguish policymaking nonpolicy making i  you’re policy making i don’t think you’re  you’re policy making want say give certain rights i suppose that’s right the chances you’ve already made determination respect  oh i’m saying  i’m saying interest  there’s governmental interest overrides  i think get virtue another distinction justice stevens drew lewis certain kinds jobs i think kind thing jobs chief justice talking congressional administrative aides there certain kinds jobs personal loyalty agreement governmental philosophy officeholder essential and i don’t think find  know that’s patronage system we’re talking jobs we’re talking patronage system well  i suppose answer would i don’t think that’s way works practical matter first amendment  no sir keep job point time policymaker person public office holder brought leaving his whole philosophy speak insofar relates job leaving i don’t think point really say congressional aide  take sublime secretary state fired republican democrat simply leaves group office group people ran public office you say well perhaps perhaps i think  i think realistically fired mr justice white really fired leaves administration it’s personal political matter many times someone perhaps different political persuasion comes but distinction i think keep mind talking kinds personnel we talking  we’re talking congressional aides we’re talking process servers bailiffs janitors window washers street cleaners  not sindermann your honor in roth i want make clear  no sir i mr chief justice i think talk due process rights we talking due process case we talking fundamental first amendment rights i think mr justice stewart sindermann made distinction clear said court said case even expectation continued employment therefore discharge discretionary reasons cannot discharge people basic exercise fundamental first amendment rights and right basic right freedom political association court held kusper versus pontikes buckley recently every member court agreed right freedom political association core first amendment well that’s true mr justice rehnquist i think court i understand comes far part buckley concerned simply well find nothing record suggest anything discriminatory set your honors always made clear letter carriers case united public workers i think buckley fundamental rights political association involved statutory scheme going infringe course don’t statutory scheme got ad hoc determination sheriff cook county public official legislative congressional enactment would infringe rights must extremely narrowly drawn must totally neutral nondiscriminatory this  pardon no i don’t believe  that’s correct that statutory scheme  yes sir yes sir well picked two departments police corrections department but i think mr justice marshall answered question first place legislature acted the legislature simply acted respect many many employees it’s devised scheme respect could could discharged said specifically republican may remain office person shall office public employee office holder opposite party but mr justice marshall says court said since 1949 every member  every member court i think recently mr justice white decision arnett continuously said thing congress legislature may  state may enact law substance republican jew negro may employed public office public employee and suggest legislature acted acting seems to irrelevant controversy legislature specifically enacted something approve congress  well i understand reference make mr chief justice i go back i said if legislature enacted provision specifically sheriff elrod i think it’s important look facts they’re undisputed mr foran frankly admits the requirement order obtain maintain job janitor process server sheriff’s office agree to switch party affiliation you’re unaffiliated affiliate democratic party cook county democratic party democrats cook county besides regular organization you agree affiliate organization work support it’s entire slate candidates sheriff line it agreed record obtained basis system mr justice rehnquist record silent it record named plaintiffs case republican sponsorship time came jobs it’s clear record entailed whether kind affirmative support particular county party ticket required yes sir i would making argument would substance statute saying republican democrat wins office shall public employee term office yes sir that’s correct i think governor elected people state hold  well state law i understand hypothetical state law mr justice white you’re  alright i suggest court said every member court years since 1949 every successive court including mr justice white arnett that kind law either  well new  oh i misunderstood my understanding law propose one says republican elected governor democrat shall permitted serve public service or way  alright think   mr justice stewart’s opinion sindermann opinions going back wyman precede make clear that cannot law involves giving requiring people price public employment give fundamental first amendment rights and i think sindermann means anything wyman mean anything cases said cannot require people give fundamental rights price public employment cases mean anything mean cannot come office office make requirement public employment  except 500 mean policymaking well i think that’s distinction drawn worked many areas mr justice white one clearly appropriate light function government way government operates elective process but you’re talking nonpolicy making employees i think follow line cases afford people fundamental constitutional rights say deprived rights discharged kept public service virtue exercise fundamental freedom political expression indirection could directly exactly mr justice stewart expresses i think could i think mr justice stevens lewis opinion indicated certain kinds positions personal nature for example maybe  let’s take sheriff’s personal chauffeur maybe person certainly isn’t making policy when new sheriff comes i suggesting keep old sheriff’s personal chauffeur bodyguard it maybe use person move person another capacity qualified sheriff’s office rather firing republican democrat he’s certainly entitled man driving car i think example give kind thing furthermore i think it’s important everybody understand we’re asking court create seventh circuit made clear we’re creating super civil service the question  thing done say people tenure can’t fired reason whatsoever simply sole reason discharged exercise freedom speech freedom political expression bear burden proof showing claim violation 1983 violation fundamental first amendment right yes sir i don’t believe perhaps i put another way mr justice powell it clear rule seventh circuit adapted create recognize certain things instance exercise first amendment rights people may discharged therefore persons discharged i suppose could allege discharge political reasons however  yes i understand question answer three things threefold number one vastly different thing civil service system presumption office holder show cause firing go whole panoply due process rights forth the burden cases would discharged employee the burden proof would discharged employee show sole reason discharge exercise first amendment rights that placement burden employee kind situation judgment makes clear would little problem terms enforcement now history regard in seventh circuit history based two things number one socalled shakman consent decree number two decision shakman lewis opinion four five years there grand total i believe four enforcement proceedings shakman decree entire period time many many thousands workers covered there i think five six cases filed general provisions shakman lewis whole period time entire seventh circuit i think instance people filed suits one instance public employees union lewis resulted lewis decision another one case filed class action situation violation admitted flagrant record dispute and others three four cases governor walker became governor people much higher levels brought actions instance resulted determination policymaking employees therefore covered i think look terms see concern interim argument based idea would flood litigation arising kind determination simply justified at time i cannot answer question without also saying dealing protection fundamental first amendment rights there one else protect rights there procedure illinois administrative state law otherwise if sheriff cook county officeholders throughout country utilized public payroll election public office tax money tax payers provide purpose soliciting army partisan workers order requiring persons forfeit fundamental rights constitution it’s  yes sir no i don’t mr justice powell assume things true it’s necessarily clear record assume things true it doesn’t seem i think reply brief they’ve basically admitted agreed there fundamental constitutional rights involved waiver applied situation construction law waiver you’re dealing first amendment rights but forgetting looking legal standpoint analyzing whether could waiver constitutional rights i don’t think phrase terms “live sword die sword” analogy kind phrase expresses idea i don’t think that applied situation in first place people involved nonpolicy making employees public agencies people least position exercise election going elsewhere order preserve constitutional rights they’re people applied need jobs they compelled order receive jobs get jobs agree forgo constitutional rights with respect particular job chauffeurbodyguard yes personal loyalty personal connection maybe required i think mr justice  mr chief justice practical kind situation sort i’m saying personal chauffeur sheriff may  sheriff probably right reassign elevator operator whence came that’s whence came rather driver rest department i don’t think constitution requires  the sheriff well i don’t think anybody going say give another job if sheriff discharges practical matter exercises occurred patronage function discharging large numbers people lawsuit maybe filed alleging person others discharged solely political affiliation burden proof sustained person recover no sir no could prove discharged solely exercise fundamental constitutional rights would claim i think chances many people  see decision court mr chief justice i might say generally decisions court generally respected people country including public officials and court declares seems analysis applicable constitutional law requires declares practices violative fundamental constitutional rights public officials start obeying law public officials cook county obeying law shakman decree result almost litigation result public officials come flaunt decree supreme court united states declares fundamental constitutional rights entitled protection area and reason among others judgment great problem terms flood litigation but court duty vindicate rights that’s  clearer function court i don’t know vindicate basic fundamental constitutional rights we started i intended start i guess i’ll end instead mr justice white’s question mr foran governmental interest  governmental interest served fundamental constitutional rights able infringed make infringement condition public employment governmental interest thank mr chief justice,410.0,596,39,i’m sure record shows federal system state systems tenured service came if it’s anything new first amendment us since 1791 andrew jackson feel free say “to victors belong spoils” now wait minute you agree thing balancing test you would agree governor’s principal assistant springfield special counsel certainly give constitutional rights he’s republican wants counsel democratic government governor tells that’s fine register democrat he’s got to get job doesn’t to get policymaking job analysis it’s republican administration really  you’re democrat may well give constitutional rights i talking policy making right inaudible interest overrides  well arrive how arrive fact policy maker get  it’s alright fire policymaking office holder now  say kind job whatever gentleman’s first amendment interests sufficient keep job is yes  isn’t yes he doesn’t keep job how say he’s fired political beliefs well i would think he’s fired doesn’t  likely doesn’t agree new boss what want say the sindermann case referred i think roth wasn’t considerable emphasis placed expectation continued employment isnt whole area we’re talking though in court’s positions in buckley also though court sustaining public financing provisions indicated congress could go pretty far distance funding two major parties differently minority party you say statutory scheme i thought statutory scheme the rights approximately almost half employees sheriff’s office tenured civil service employees that’s statutory scheme isn’t do agree friend mr foran legislature could make everyone office sheriff except sheriff tenured civil servant but picked 1200 does statutory construction something one legislative body acts one field doesn’t act area another is also agreed plaintiffs obtain job operation system now would  i take would making kind argument state law state statute state constitutional provision said enacting rule democrats republicans may work state government what we’re saying whatever party wins election must staff state government from bottom top whoever wins elections runs government although fact  although fact republican gets selected governor automatically takes care democrat  republican moves runs state government i mean whoever wins election runs government now what’s wrong  what’s difference legislature saying “well we’re going replace democratic governor republican election” saying “well replace elevator operator” if state law says win election also replace elevator operator but it’s different one well neutral law this neutral access whoever wins elections work government republican democrat or socialist communist whoever wins or put way   whoever wins election staffs government except 500 inaudible is exception policy making  reason i want give example arizona corporation commission consisting three members elected highly political executive secretary policymaking responsibilities whatever he simply hangs around speak inscribe commission’s orders docket sheets i would say definition policymaker can party control corporation commission changes new majority replace theory mr tucker in line you’re saying prevail litigation practical matter won’t set stage every noncivil service government employee local state national contest discharge ground politically motivated whenever discharged someone opposite party  would think likely individual would think reason political there must hundreds thousands noncivil service employees government levels large country i’m wondering extent position would breed vast flood litigation i’m interested saying they’re forced forgo constitutional rights all respondents everyone people talking accepted employment system attacking do think there’s anything argument advanced brother waive constitutional right may they knew they understood system you’ve already said isn’t right sheriff’s chauffeur bodyguard does anything policymaking it isn’t exclusively confined policymaking who’s going decide yes who’s going decide whether sheriff must give another job judge suppose instead firing large blocks fired one man  change first  fundamental first amendment rights when you’re talking

government and last column find provision charter clause 13 bottom complain in substance happened maritime commission took section 709 rewrote include sliding scale additional charter hire high 90 and first controversy whether legal authority charge excess amounts now ship sales act form charter adopted september 1946 the maritime commission fixed basic annual hire im using liberty vessels purposes illustration type company charter fixed basic hire 96000 year ships payable irrespective profits losses that 14000 minimum could fixed per annum section they proposed sliding scale additional charter hire charterers industry associations objected objections raised provisions charter amended a provision added clause 13 foldout sheet page 7 brief footnote stating payments additional charter hire based profits made clause would tentative preliminary final audit charterers accountings profits losses  time final audit adjustment would made amounts refunded charterers may required now clause subject litigation weve cited cases brief its admitted put protect position respect dispute whether charter provision calling sliding scale additional charter hire conflicted statutory provision yes your honor and i wont go details  i think record clear the district judge case found reserved rights relied  rights  holding  holding back raising issue later time and series regulations i quote  quote one foldout sheet toward bottom second column it says “referring additional charter hire payment shall deemed preliminary subject adjustment come  upon completion audit commission covering period involved and neither tender thereof charterer acceptance commission shall prejudice rights either applicable bareboat charter agreement otherwise now course petitioners signed form charter subject reservation and accountings were minor matters settled as matter fact several disputes settled within framework   charter the remaining dispute question involving sliding scale additional charter hire one question ill come later we litigated question numerous courts there nine decisions squarely point they range decision says absolutely right shouldnt doubt decision court indicated thought decision favor lost forest pedagogy  inaudible in forest pedagogy the decisions  divergence reasoning decisions seems the government argued section 709 provides inclusion 5050 profitsharing clause really fixes minimum drafted benefit government amount excess 50 could contracted outside scope statute relying upon first sentence section 5 b says charter hire vessel chartered provisions section shall fixed commission  rate commission determines consistent policies act and stopped but argument course next word statute “but” and followed numerous restrictions decisions maritime commission make respect charter hire the first one rate shall less 15 per annum unless four members maritime commission decide may the second restriction restriction imposed section 709 says every charter shall contain provision providing even division profits government further argue quite obvious legislative history well plain language section 5 b talking section discretion respect fixing profitsharing they talked rate charter hire fixed advance payable annually based upon statutory sales price vessels sold and view authorize profitsharing arrangement furthermore first part section speaks charter high  hire fixed commission rate commission determines consistent policies act cannot interpreted permit profitsharing arrangement inconsistent next section act fixes profitsharing arrangement 15 and legislative history indicates  legislative history section 5 b quote briefs indicates congress consistently thinking  fixed charter hire based percentage originally percentage proposed congress 85 statutory sales price figure derived 1936 merchant marine act kept progressing the next draft legislation fixed rate 125 third proposal 15 and put 15 congress considered might high rate therefore added sentence end would permit 15 lowered now  government well court took position provisions 709 construed minimum profitsharing arrangement theory purpose dominant purpose 1946 ship sales act sell vessels rather charter but obviously congress intended vessels chartered would put authority statute and clear also legislative history congress expected chartering program aid rehabilitation postwar merchant marine well sales provisions there number companies  none companies ships available right war chartering would fillin needs vessels either reconverting vessels converted military use constructing new vessels in  i indicated section 709 comes 1936 merchant marine act in case act question profitsharing arrangement 5050 minimum maximum arrangement the legislative history clear course argue distinction interpretation section 1946 act interpretation section 1936 act i might say your honors bareboat form charter maritime commission promulgated risk laws charterers the ship turned bareboat state they man ships supply insure keep repair redeliver government end charters if lost money loss meantime government would receiving 15 basic charter hire the second question  your honors one refer split accounting 1947 in middle 1947 shipping market declined quite markedly the maritime commission  year 1947 substantial profits the maritime commission became concerned would turn market left ships hands companies high profitsharing rates 90 might diluted losses occurred later 1947 so august 1947 sent telegrams charterers said terminating charters 15 days notice charterers might continue use vessels would agree profits earlier year might offset losses might sustain later year now companies course developed trade routes trying get back business abrupt termination wouldve quite serious continuing charters signed going end year next year so signed addendum contract called foreign trade addendum principal provision profitsharing purposes year 1947 would divided two parts september 1 1947 profits date would accounted separately profits losses turned date the  termination charter the ships redelivered maritime commission the  simply amended term one two terms minor respects principal term    companies objected divided accounting term now  effect particular requirement petitioner charter regulations maritime commission suffered overall loss 50000 charter government took 500000 profits period prior september 1 plus 700000 basic charter hire paid monthly charter so government received 1200000 charter company lost 50000 the court respect issue  well get back  complaint section 709 get back section says every charter made commission pursuant provisions title shall provide whenever end calendar year subsequent execution charter accumulative net voyage profit much profit shall shared 5050 our contention that section fixes 5050 profitsharing division companies requires accounting made calendar year basis charter and violation section well require companies agree accounting basis rather calendar year words split year two parts the court government point  take position 709 thats mandatory say provision statute merely fixed minimum terms and terms although conflict section beneficial government could provided contract we say law otherwise mandatory section could change basis accounting simply purpose attempting get additional charter hire companies statute required inaudiblein  what   present contract  on   asking litigate questions if rely fact contract excess  no we   reservation clause  reservation clause contract general reservation clause i referred earlier and regulations maritime commission issued pursuant reservation clause state rights reserved contract otherwise and reservation applies equally problem well problem sliding scale additional charter hire inaudible string argument ultra vires anyway its inconsistent statute con  addendum contract inconsistent statute statute requires calendar year accounting made us divide accounting two parts  one calendar year now your honors please case deals charters entered ship sales act 1946 i think decision court may impact administration merchant marine act 1936 course act maritime commission subsidizes shipping industry present time there sections  sections merchant marine act 1936 section 606 5 page 52 brief course passed time section 709 passed provision every contract entered merchant marine act 1936 shall provide 5050 division profits companies arising subsidy agreements there many provisions act speak mandatory terms and court holds general grant authority either 1936 act case 1946 act permits maritime commission modify mandatory provisions theory fix minimum requirements undermine administration 1936 act  permit effect government agency involved  rewrite view mandatory provision set congress considerable debate discussion going one point your honors  decisions us implied companies making tremendous profits charters could use world open market market high reason seem feel theres justification  view stretching statute permit sliding scale although speaks terms 5050 we dont agree that argument material i would like say word in first place world war ii united states really monopoly vessels available charter sale there 4000 vessels built war 20 million tons shipping in handling chartering program maritime commission careful specify charters regulations ships could used certain routes could charge certain rates shippers cases subcharters negotiated  shippers basis cost in way commission confined profits industry find companies profits excess   subject recapturing excess 50 rate great many claims its ones come court involved payment additional charter hire higher rates sliding scale rates so say profits  maritime commission attempted accomplished squeezing profit element charters made charters argument thats based exorbitant value excessive profits material case and one last point obviously  case companies made  even 50 rate made profits share profits course subject income tax would impact  leveling profit factor charters id like reserve rest time rebuttal i think  well i  i dont think i would admit your honor i think section 5 b restricted nature rate fixed would question inaudible but i think presence 709 act makes abundantly clear mean profitsharing dealt  section 5 b i  i dont think read conjunction 709 i think would doubt even 709 act but i  would different case your honor it depends upon whether termination  no i think your honor there  well there termination the ships redelivered substance change one provision yes  depends upon court  court views  documents signed whether regard new charter simply continuation voice overlap  if new charter new vessel old charter accounting would naturally start new ship  if  old charter ended thats correct yes thats right your honor and  point  rely upon  reason given maritime commission sending notice termination the reason wanted segregate earlier profits that reason gave terminating charter it wanted ships back wanted chart someone else wanted contract fleet it simply afraid profits previously accrued higher rates might dissipated well no one would want your honor well wouldnt uneconomical inaudible well i think  revolves your honor  resolves question  whether trying circumvent provisions section 709 there number cases say purpose execution amendment contract exaction condition circumvent mandatory provision statute done regarded fiction contend fiction   fictional termination well i dont think would question happened december 31st although  i  i wont  i wont admit your honor it depends upon happened december 31st if happened  wouldnt question would calendar year basis well the  charter   thing happened december 31st i think would question question because wouldve done would say accounting additional charter hire terminates december 31st start anew january 1st and come back another question courts charters well meaning cumulative net voyage profits the courts held  fourth circuit held accumulative net voyage profits mean combining profits year year entire period charter and maritime commission attempted prevent accumulation year year would contrary statute and precisely happened commission regulation said could carry forward losses one calendar year offset profits next calendar year could carry forward profits one calendar year offset losses subsequent calendar year and fourth circuit held that regulation improper that statute means take charter entirety beginning end accumulate results voyages every given year also computing profits offset profits losses occur year year well i  i think  no never said your honor they never said i think read  underlying memoranda see changing 709 i  no the courts effect said even though commission relied 709 made excess charge could ratified 5 b later thats  by courts and course  dispute number cases point we say cant  sliding scale cant retroactively validated section law government agency never relied  made finding may  may yes yes your honor  form charter proposed august 12 1946 industry sliding scale on august 15 1946 three days later ship operators association sent  wrote maritime commission included copy resolution adopted meeting reads way result consensus opinion members association recapture profits proposed form bareboat charter commensurate risks charterer assumes charter party association title 7 section 709 merchant marine act 1936 questions legality commissions right recapture 50 net voyage profits excess 10 per annum behalf members association reserves rights section by date american merchant marine institute represents new york companies west coast associations protested telegram  included sentence said proposed rate additional charter hire exceeds rate authorized applicable law now litigated time bar issue brought form charter changed the war shipping administration 50 provision changed add preliminary payment language and government admitted many times ill read one briefs time bar litigation “because disputes possible violation statute maritime changed language charter make even clearer suit filed once” now  make even clearer suit filed in words  yes issue that issue dispute time charters signed now 1951 approximately time company submitted final accounting asked submitted sliding scale theory the maritime commission sent circular letter charterers insisting thats foot page 40 brief insisting made payments additional charter hire accountings accompanied statement signed authorized official company stating part acceptance payment shall construed approval correctness amount thereof waiver rights remedies either party terms agreements involved otherwise and late 1955 maritime commission i think indication thought charter meant maritime commission wrote number companies put correspondence record stating well i refer example   page 103 record your honor member group protested 1946 time charter clause put thats  yes no your honor i dont think thats correct we  objected industry protest ive  in beginning we  object protest obtained reservation rights charter regulations  but  well your honor   thats correct says unqualifiedly accepted charter accepted qualification provision unlawful would right raise issue   later time well thats  thats  regulations clause  clause 13 page 7 brief also record stated payments made additional charter hire would preliminary and issue your honors tried district court washington i read judge beeks opinion point he says “from review evidence i convinced revision” meaning change terms charter “resulted charterers protest intended postpone approval  accrual claims including based illegality” and goes say “regulations issued maritime commission respect preliminary determination additional charter hire instructions issued maritime covering restrictive legends voucher checks numerous letters maritime inaudible charterers effective  effect charterers claims based upon illegality anticipated time entering charters rights reserved charters” and  point goes heart argument question reservation question whether completed charter taken benefits renouncing charter were we insisting per  permitted litigate issue reserved time charters signed theres windfall theres denial terms charters abiding charterers now  mr chief justice asked letter 1955 at pages 103 104 letter written one charterers and page  written maritime commission page 104 says “from provisions clause”  type letter written maritime commission asking companies pay charter hire refusing pay company refuse pay 63000 charter hire dispute but wrote letters companies say “youve agreed charter pay if pay us rights reserved” and letter written 1955 litigation commenced same effect yes your honor theres four five   included record now getting back 1936 act 1946 act  i  i dont regard  unfair your honor two reasons once  one protest time make change shouldve made change time now second paramount important reason goes case maritime commission consider whether wish raise 15 rate and raise vessels operating subcharters shippers government agencies said 15 rate raised agencies shippers would pay higher rate and impact would fallen government addi  raise 15 and way could get hire get higher contingent hire would try take something would otherwise stay shipping companies so i  i dont feel that argument substance i said  profit squeezed charters  view regulations requirements maritime commission controlled rates ships could operated and charters subcharters negotiated costplus basis course took profit well well  wasnt anything considered normal profit your honor the statute  take every dollar addition  profit you  would take every dollar profit example company made dollar would come 10 cents would go steam ship company capital employed operating ship ships required substantial capital on capital thats right and  equipment needed use there several factors entered  computation capital you would need working capital hire crew load cargo things nature fixed formula let us say 150000 ship per year would get 10 and profitdollar  balance profitdollar would divided either 5050 10  90 depending upon profit bracket these ships  ones involved case transatlantic coal trade now i would bring also consistent practice using sliding scale coastwise trade 50 profitsharing arrangement and number passenger ships used 50 profitsharing arrangement and sliding scale profitsharing used respect certain dried cargo vessels no investment   bareboat charter thats correct only investment working capital terminals  things  moving ship hiring crew outfitting vessel paying stevedores normal expenses  ship operation and course paid government 15 basic charter hire ship well statutory sales price in words paid government 96000 year use ships pro  irrespective profits losses and  its division profits thats correct your honor one point  i two minutes under 1936 act i think thats perhaps important case applying 1946 act there  two provisions fixing basic charter hire here was15 1936 act theres provision section 706 permits fixing basic charter hire competitive bids flat rate per annum there another provision says may build ships charter industry 85 less 85 cost government constructing vessel thats provision thats parallel section 5 b and court holds section 709 a minimum held minimum purposes 1936 act well goes sections 1936 act specific provisions im  relying 1940  46 act yes but feel theres parallel two acts construction one act likely carry construction statute i  i dont think could make contract like 1936 act cases seem agree us point because minimum maximum section 709 a minimum maximum your honor read legislative history find statements say 1936 act 50 goes steam ship company 50 goes government and whole evolution 1936 act one im trying lay firm standards inaudible  lay firm standards guide  inaudible that objective lay firm standards  handling shipping governments vessels  permit government agency great deal discretion happened prior 1936 act no i  i think congress  thats correct i think congress wrote safeguards right act and intend  agency could make different deal one company could another provision act specific 1936 act they meant provision apply specifically minimum maximum thank you,402.0,441,29,number 137 massachusetts trustees eastern gas fuel associates petitioner versus united states mr fort inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible  suggest inaudible profitsharing and second point turns whether was termination charter but   lose point termination charter were saying terminated but termination charter new charter issued annual accounting feature doesnt  wouldnt worry anybody would and old one would end old charter ended so question whether happened interpreted termination do  plans  charters   i suppose wanted couldve returned ships taken back new charter who wouldve wanted done anybody i mean cha   client said theyd wanted keep ships accept amended terms werent interested  returning ships yes so  fact doesnt become persuasive werent turned inaudible this thing happened december 31st wouldnt say  termination you wouldnt raised but still would  still would perfectly sensible question ask whether charter terminated inaudible say charter elsewhere that clause 13 rested upon 709 they  set regula  circular  public circular something isnt what yes im  indication commission ever relied 5 b count and courts rely 5 b by courts mr barnett inaudible inaudible argument mr barnett shipping companies entered charters 1946 eyes open made protest excess  excess profitsharing completed  charter and received money two three years later filed  filed suit without  sustain theory yes to make thats particular issue its typical voice overlap  well  103 1955 year company first complained inaudible protested thats right but i gather  i dont know affidavit correct i dont even know made page 179 protest written inaudible matter taken read sign  company redesigned according statement maritime never advised february 15th 1955 eastern gas way objected sliding scales is correct at  beginning but says inference protest one thing maritime commission insisted going make less that agreed suggested although sliding scale objected boats traveling route proposed modified sliding scale additional charter half 50 this court   hadnt said event attempt failed eastern gas unqualifiedly accepted sliding scale gave bond perform operate  increased allocation vessels almost year waited eight years contending sliding scale invalid is right where  where qualification record inaudible effect isnt the effect yes yes inaudible inaudible normal profit  base considered profits excess the you mean 10 profit capital you  money used operating ship inaudible inaudible investment ship  bareboat charter you mean capital used transporting ship moving ship well wouldnt enter i guess division excess profits inaudible do rely 1936 act 1947 1946 act well mean saying agency without authority 1936 act make contract like why but certainly exclusion power sell probably cheap make subsidies big inaudible,3026.0,4532,76,mr chief justice may please court i want emphasize outset shipping lines seeking in litigation related litigation windfall its windfall millions dollars they offered charters low fixed rate condition agreed pay government high percentage excessive profits specifically 50 profits excess 10 return 50 first 100 day per ship 75 next 200 day per ship profits excess even 300 day 90 excessive profits the shipping lines entitled given charters given charters favorable terms way required accept charters they chose presumably though terms advantageous and even claim total hire paid charters greater fair value ships point fact considerably less world market rate now gotten benefit contracts asked court revise bargain give even favorable terms they ground allegedly part consideration provided provided form forbidden congress and remedy asked court excise contract additional part consideration otherwise enforce contract despite failure consideration according terms now specifically agreed pay fix rate equal 15 statutory sales price plus 90 excessive profits what asked court give benefit contract agreed one rate equal low fixed rate plus 50 excessive profits now result obviously relationship contract agreed but i want show would relationship contract commission would ever agreed told 1946 could use form contracting now i think thats selfevident simply relationship low fixed hire high percentage profit recovery record oh  provide original contract issued authority ship sales act 1946 some vessels leased i would develop history leased  actually  ship sales act passed 1946 commission established policy committee special policy committee charter committee advise terms charter  charter vessels now interim  1946 act implemented war shipping administration preexisting emergency war time powers chartered vessels now war shipping administration done rate equal 15 statutory sales price basically fixed rate contracts provide plus 50 excess profits now policy committee appointed highlevel officials maritime commission immediately unanimously agreed rates entirely low permitted exorbitant profits continued would undermine whole purpose act namely sell ships  charter ships the purpose get government shipping business sell ships chartering tolerated necessary interim measure satisfy worlds needs shipping there sufficient tonnage available privately owned fleet reestablished necessary allow commission charter vessels use interim period and commission  committee unanimously agreed existing rates charged war shipping administration would frustrate policy must increased there question whether increased the question the committee thought preferable increase fixed charge rather increase percentage profits recaptured it argued shipping rates generally high trades less remunerative  high fixed charge could paid and impracticable negotiate different terms chartered depending upon trade ship going used and much convenient provide increase form profitsharing would provide automatic adjustment total hire profitability particular trade in addition argued decline shipping rates could anticipated immediate postwar demand slackened capacity became available and flexible rate ie greater profitsharing rate would provide needed flexibility adoptability now one member  one member committee disagreed recommendation he argued terms act consistent policy discouraging chartering encouraging purchase required set fixed rate nearly equal worlds shipping rate world charter rate prevailing market rate and urged double fixed rate 15 i think 34 still  least world rate least computed now commission initially  initially directed   actually two co  two study committees first one reported commission initially directed  recommended raising fixed rate increasing profitsharing rate and commission initially rejected proposal told go back come forth proposal increase fixed rate actually reconstituted  advisory committee but new committee persisted view  much preferable way increase rates increase rate profitsharing and ultimately commission agreed advisory committee adopted  kept rates fixed rates rate charged  basically rate charged war shipping administration increased rate profitsharing finally settled sliding scale formula 50 first 100 75 next 200 90 excess now unique  uniquely documented record contains reports two committees minutes commissions meetings long detailed affidavit member one committees evolution chartering policy now shipping lines asked court excise contract increase profitsharing rate otherwise enforce contract according terms in effect claimed right retain use  benefit use ships pay 15 statutory price plus 50 excessive profits precisely rates commission committee unanimous agreement permitted exorbitant profits would wholly undermine purposes act now  no your honor my argument  oh no the  1946 act  the three  1936 act made mandatory inclusion clause providing payment 50 and 1946 act adopted provision requiring clause what ive talking administrative practice the war shipping administration  1936 act separate authority war time authority chartered ships 50   profitsharing and  no no the  1946 act deal contract terms it  policy however sell ships charter required  thats right 40  1946 act correct but beginning implementation 1946 act weve always used least 1957 507590 scale thats profit  profitsharing provision used 1946 act the  oh nothing nothing i  i  i get  no i  ive dealing  commissions exercise judgment deter  deciding kinds contracts would consistent overall policy act i havent  i havent gotten question specific statutory authority i deal effect incorporation section 709 show that limit basic authority contracting authority but ive showing evolution administrative policy my point really simply never would commission agreed contract shipping lines seek had commission told 1946 could increase profitsharing rate would thats demonstrable record would instead increased fixed rate my point seeking court throw increase profitsharing rate allow keep low fixed rate and i say would produce solely windfall shipping companies now theyre asserting right receive contract terms specific terms they say simply addition form additional consideration unauthorized prevent frustrating intent congress commission allowed collect but say able keep contract  benefits contract pay reduced rate the fact giving ships bargain basement terms would even flagrantly frustrate intent congress seems irrelevant now fact  course would result even true  even true commission authority bargain additional profitsharing terms result would whole contract would fall the low fixed rate high profitsharing rate parts single system compensation one falls falls wouldnt  whole contract must fall failure bargain consideration the parties would remanded law restitution adjust rights shipping lines use vessels would obligated pay quantum valebant fair value use and happens case fact fair value use exceeds total hire payable contract least government would undertake prove the result would would pay us unless contract effective least limit liability as  secondly i  i get details attack statutory authority theres another answer accepted contract accepted benefits shipping lines estopped standing challenge validity terms i think particularly true contract made benefit charterers convenience government theres nothing act suggest purpose benefit charterers the purpose act sell ships charter chartering permitted interim measure satisfy need ships transitional period the purpose foster maintain domestic fleet it true privately owned domestic fleet chartered fleet now  purpose chartering simply  get ships afloat serve worlds needs benefit charterers the dealings commission shipping lines simply arms length business transaction the concern commission set rates low enough would people willing take ships well  the industry overall industry interest get ships  buy ships the industry throughout kept  business declined kept protesting extent chartering commission engaged and  congressional committee authorizing extension deplored extent chartering insisted commission tightened charter  oh well no sure anybody  anybody interested get best terms available find nothing  act history suggest purpose confer benefit served charterers they concerned  congress didnt like government business they wanted sell ships nec  necessary private fleet became rehabilitated something carry grain coal and heavy demand part rehabilitation program in  well  told repeatedly repeated courts industry protested that comes try find protested telegram sent industry association saying “we think rates high  high besides question illegality” now legal effect generalized advocates kind urging nil now  yes inaudible no no im  i  im sure details i would like i think protest shipping lines life charters there protest time signing charters i think protest time annual accountings the controversy came charters terminated somebody found argument and afterthefact argument right get windfall get back money bargained pay thats case in case im  im told case 1953 the charter terminated case 1947 it six years charter terminated raised question the  course since initial victory theres plethora litigation that 1957 also  1957 thats right now  yes the  industry got idea claim started per  process generally i dont know here first time raised 1953 now id like say simplest answer case estoppel anything else its grounds judge aldrich decided case and even passing questions passing deference administrative expertise theres slightest substance challenge commissions authority bargain the act  basic chartering power granted section 5 b act governments brief page 46 section 5 provides commission may discretion charter vessels opinion chartering would consistent policies act now policies act suggested title ship sales act fact declaration policy section 2 act says declared policy act foster development encouragement  encourage maintenance efficient adequate americanowned merchant marine defined merchant marine owned operated united states flag citizens united states the committee reports likewise emphasized purpose sell ships the objective measure course transfer government owned tonnage private ownership later much policy measure put many warbuilt vessels possible private ownership the commission directed approve applications charter unless chartering consistent policies act its also shown act statutory requirement commission prefer applications buy applications charter stringent time limitations imposed upon commissions chartering authority this chartering authority initially although later extended expire december 31 1947 one yearandthreequarters act this strictly interim measure utilize ships privately owned tonnage sufficiently augmented the  terms ships  chartered governed  initially section 5 b insofar relevant provides charter hire vessel chartered provisions section shall fixed commission rate commission determines consistent policies act now point point chartering terms left entirely commission subject guideline encourage ship sales encourage chartering charter extent necessary take slack privately owned fleet  rehabilitated now provision stood alone act i dont see doubt commission thought best way get necessary ships operation yet prevent excessive profits could charged fixed rate plus percentage excessive profits deemed appropriate get charterers agree that charter would wholly authorized doubt act contained i would like point also would doubt commission authorized make charters contained profitsharing provision that  thats another implication 5 b it didnt  far theyre concerned profitsharing provision so question  question effect section 5 c incorporation reference section 709 1936 act 5 c says provisions among others section 709 merchant marine act 1936 shall applicable charters made section 709 brief page 48 49 says every charter made commission shall provide whenever voyage profits exceed 10 return capital necessarily employed charterer shall pay commission additional charter hire onehalf cumulative net voyage profits excess 10 now agree petitioner quite right that mandatory provision hes quite right theres limitation commissions chartering power as ive said far 5 b concerned commission didnt include profitsharing provision section 709 takes away freedom provides commission however unwise may think however much industry resist however inconsistent commission may think statute overall policies commission must include 50 profitsharing provision if failed actually would unauthorized government could collect 50 anyway it mandatory provision now answer however got nothing issue case this contract include provision requiring charterer pay united states 50 excessive profits the commission went beyond congress required fact required charterers pay 90 it didnt flout congress want congress one better congress said must require repay 50 we require pay 90 now argument petitioners make cannot simply mandatory provision that doesnt answer question the argument must rather one collateral implications section 709 as i understand essentially occupation field theory congress directing must include 50 provision must intended forbid commission bargain greater percentage now  argument   intelligible one i understand argument i dont understand possible reason attributing congress purpose forbid commission bargain better terms could get the  makes  inaudible of course makes perfect sense it makes perfect sense congress insist 50 provision leave commission that thereby assure commission inadvertently otherwise set low rates least 50 recaptured but makes sense leave commission free set terms contract fixed rates kind rate single profitsharing provisions forbid commission bargain better terms terms profitsharing the   pur   i say theres nothing act purpose benefit charterers why would congress say however exorbitant profits may even exceed 300 day must allow must allow shipping lines keep half you cannot bargain higher percentage profits now mandatory direction include 50 however much industry may resist require 50 provision one hand on hand provision may bargain would serve two totally separate disparate i think inconsistent purposes and i dont see direc  direction include one contains way implication may add there simply inconsistency basis contrary implications now way analogy mr fort told provisions act might affected line argument i would like point another provision 1936 act incorporated precisely fashion 1946 act provides every charter shall provide mandatory provision charterer shall expense keep chartered vessel good state repair efficient operating condition does mean commission may bargain charterer make capital improvements rather repairs the answer course doesnt perhaps germane also provides every charter shall provide mandatory provision whenever president shall proclaim security national defense makes advisable commission may terminate charter does provision occupy field termination clauses would make  wouldve make invalid clause authorizing termination either party say 15days notice time apparently even shipping lines willing go quite far charters contain 15day termination clause limited presidents making determination national defense terminate time 15days notice validity clause would germane second argument but  none litigation  seem extreme arguments couldve made one ever challenged validity 15day termination clause grounds statute requires clause saying president may determine interest national defense now point statutory requirement include one provision benefit government carries implication contracting agency may bargain better terms it requires   term yes sir yes yes sir no no sir you must  must provide  must provide charterer shall pay 50 that correct that correct i dont read if commission  commission   issued charter provide require profitsharing if commission agreed charter require profitsharing would unauthorized it must include provision requiring charterer pay 50 i agree that correct and must include provision im reading it if didnt would still collect  i say contract provide it provides shall pay us 50 and i say  it  statute doesnt say “and more” the statute says must provide shall pay 50 50 i sorry   half “shall provide must pay half” right the    contract i saying require charterer pay half half included 75 they required pay half they required pay half this fully satisfies congressional direction oh inaudible  alright okay let  okay let  let frame  let suppose three  contract containing three clauses the first clause first clause provides fixed rate charter hire the second clause called “contingent basic charter hire” provides commission  charterer must pay 50 excessive profits 100 80 but doesnt satisfy statute it doesnt require excessive profits its statutory clause but third clause statute  contract hike thereabout   clause required section 709 requiring payment first two clauses net voyage profit left charterer must pay 50 united states it would clause terms  contract it would preceded another payment term also form profitsharing theres nothing forbid terms form profitsharing all this insist thered 50 profitsharing and theres reason read forbidding commission bargain get theres lot reason  theres lot reason require commission include provision it might unacceptable charterers but theres reason forbid it get now  inaudible argument 709 read inaudible 1936 provision fixing 15 fixed rate inaudible thats minimum inaudible i  i think  i think like termination clause it  quite minimum its simply requirement inclusion prohibition something else so commission couldnt  it   inaudible thats right youve got include inaudible well alright it operates minimum i wouldnt try  inaudible what  i get inaudible inclusion profit read way well alright yes but im   yes that argument right but  rationale kind statutory requirement include one particular clause another benefit government clause allowing president terminate contract times national emergency carries implication cant bargain broader powers termination there negative implication requirement include particular clause benefit government the main  yes the  main authority  special authority thats correct well  well the practice  no oh  yes they include the question whether  well far 709 concerned i think correct now whether  well i would voice overlap  no i would question there  theres issue voice overlap  but include the question whether couldve included 90 clause well  but  yes right the question would  yes the question would  question would whether direction let contracts competitive bidding person bidding highest price somehow inconsistent inclusion profitsharing terms basic authority they didnt general grant discretion the commission directed  – previously it  that correct youve got go back basic chartering authority there  in act that act  direction let voice overlap  id  i believe commission correct im sorry i thought talking 1936 act in case  thats ground  id like deal thered  i may id like summarize  state law no 7  section 709 there would question  got go back basic contracting authority in 1936 act basic contracting authority different they directed let charters competitive bidding it would question whether direction let contracts competitive bidding implies always bidding fixed price authorizing include profitsharing type terms basic authority now i would argue  i would argue 1936 act could competitive bidding invitation bids provided profitsharing addition required 709 i would argue im  im prepared purposes case  oh i dont  i dont well   no there might question old no im saying might questions old well i think  1competitive bidding  yes i think thats right and  i  i would  i would read authority permitting  oh it doesnt apply vessels this act i think exclusive applied war  warbuilt vessels i dont think 1936 act terms applies fleet warbuilt fleet none i know thats really im arguing that    entitled  yes right thats right i  i think  ask cocounsel i see  i see nothing statute now  five decisions holding invalid least tentatively invalid additional charter hire provision four district courts one court claims only one one disagrees anything ive said thus far thats american president lines case rest california district court its printed petitioners appendix now said 709 carries negative implication i least understand rationale though much i disagree implication drawn the others much obscure grounds they start agreeing least assuming purposes argument commission authority power that specifically agree three clause kind contract could fixed  youd threeclauses one fixed hire the second contingent basic charter hire something its profitsharing clause third statutory form requiring pay 50 profits remaining pay hire first two clauses now  three  four  three clause contract achieve exactly results all second clause first profitsharing clause you leave  leave charterer twice much leave third clause cut half so almost thing many clauses want now  i take theres nothing act requires commission clutter charters already complicated enough redundant provisions use two clauses one serve so  objection courts found commission whether put petitioner presumably understands better i commission couldve done section 5 b didnt act section 5 b acted section 709 all i say i dont understand means says commission acted section 709 i dont  i dont care  i dont care call the commission broad contracting power it contract way sees fit basically theres basic grant power contract any time  sure anytime profitsharing provision course say profits talking left fixed charges come thats says its  profits left fixed charges come shall split 5050   50  well  excess profitsharing defined its excess 10 capital necessarily employed operation now  yes the  that  thats argument  thats argument right yes but  709 never never source authority anything and anybody suppose anyone ever thought escapes 5 b create basic authority charter ships thats authority commission its authority couldve exercised theres reason world think thought section 709   authorized anything 709 it never granted authority in 1946  it requirement it limitation it   what  authority  the  basic  apart 709 apart 709 could put 709 says must its limitation but  i   well i  i say i  i  i  no that  told charter ships best terms get but thats   basic grant authority the charter terms terms rate determine consisted policies act it   broad charter commission carry policies act charter ships now matter fact also incorporated 1946 act 1936 act provision said commission may enter contracts behalf united states   may discretion necessary carry activities authorized manner private corporation may contract within scope authority conferred charter theyve given broad  initially broad im arguing isnt argument 709 doesnt carve authority initial grant authority effective limitation 15 floor terms determine consistent policies act the policies act sell ships the thing congress concerned committee report showed provision included tell commission “dont make term favorable lines would rather charter buy make stiff terms enough ships available postwar emergency period favorable enough encourage people charter we want buy ships we want get chartering business” thats consistent policies act mean so initial grant authority virtually unlimited  could certainly included profitsharing provision basic grant authority the question  question whether incorporation 709 takes away authority bargain anything 50 thats question argument theres implication requiring included 50 clause may bargain something better 50 now id like say  ive dealt case though open question decided de novo reading statute well fact maritime commission charged carry act made abstract interpretation clause chartered thou  least hundreds hundreds ships charters containing clause now certainly whatever left doctrine deference administrative agencies requires courts lightly upset whole pattern con  whole group contracts executed many years basis arguable negative implications drawn mandatory provisions well  thats correct then  thats internal arguments 1946 whether raise one the act  well      1947 change form charter i think use higher fixed rates   50 profitsharing not  i dont think litigation it may actually  actually litigation prior time they may wanted avoid question yes well  yes thats  thats quite right inaudible thats quite right inaudible yes oh yes thats correct i think since current charters since 1947 i believe included 50 profitsharing provision i dont think  except charters prior time i dont think question would raised it could raised commission changes charter policy under outstanding charter yes went back yes thats right correct from  1946  1946 i think 1957 all charters no for 10 years inaudible from  from 1946 1957 1957 right right but i think proportionally increased fixed charges im certain i inaudible  condition shipping industry changed  consider proper charge im familiar they  turned ships lighter part 1947 yes yes yes no do know  the accounting  im told accounting went 1940 1951 now  correct the  lot litigation statute limitations question there lot litigation statute limitations question its court it case reserve point still defense thats correct that  that correct that correct and time final payment made protest oh i  i would  i would like  discuss claim reservation clause contract very briefly im told government admitted clause included protect rights charterers government admits thing does admit fact i think read clause see dealing entirely different subject matter yes the second part clause 13 page 1  set forth full page 182 record 182 183 you see first clause provides accounting annually requires pay within 30 days end year 19  1950  1957 right right 1956 im told 1956 there five one on  basic question  lets see there litigation inaudible  second circuit statute limitations question there earlier questions admiralty jurisdiction i must say theres lot preliminary litigation issue when get it seems to turn rather disappointing but    no preceded litigation no oh  oh  yes yes yes yes yes the  basic clause provides end calendar year shall account within 30 days pay whats due there added clause provision says charterer agrees make preliminary payments account additional charter hire basically time year demand now means voyage made profits the clause doesnt require account end year the government may however new provision require tentatively give us share profits losses later year later accounting adjust pay back so provision tentative payments life contract provides payments sort prejudice anybodys rights of course dont prejudice anybodys rights its payment account end towed profit loss entitled share now i minutes i want deal briefly second question splityear accounting in december 1947 december 1947 shipping industry previously profitable immediate postwar demand shortage ships produced great profits charterers large profits by 1947 demand slackened fleet increased there excess tonnage many complaints made commission excessive number chartered vessels afloat committees congress complained wanted commission something they undercutting privately owned fleet and purpose move privately owned fleet charterers undercutting privately owned fleet it reported operating losses now since right terminate contract 15days notice may wondered continued operate losses undercutting people since could always turn ship back but fact unintended  unintended effect progressive rate profitsharing now first profit 10 return  way convenience i could reduce 10 return fixed amount day it works basically fixed amount day lets say 20 day represents 10 return so structure contract first 20 charterer kept the next 100 split 5050 government the next 200 split 75 government 25 charterer anything 90 government now per day accounting basis now days   profits beginning year 90 bracket days stay  afloat could use accounting making additional profits could reduce  could take 90 money put lower bracket paid charterer beginning year profits continue operate even necessary loss he could afford turn ship back i  i demonstrate i example place here if 640 profits one day take simplified case one day 640 profits the charterer would keep 152 most 320 90 bracket he could keep 152 if could spread profit two days would keep 240 so  fact second day long didnt suffer loss 340 still ahead so fact progressive rate structure i think unanticipated turns 50  1947 charterers continuing operate loss pressure  beginning year profits forcing they made money operating loss  congress wanted assuredly charterers undercutting private fleet carrying trade loss now force charterers turn ships didnt profitable use commission terminated existing contracts require charterers want keep ships agree addendum requiring account separately thereon anybody didnt foresee engaging loss traffic couldnt afford continue it didnt pay longer continue engage loss traffic would turn it effective no 1947 no 1946 in 1946  adopted provision contract that adopted 1946 inaudible in  1946 actually eastern company held shipping administration charters in 1946 terminated signed new form contract 1946 theres issue the issue termination 1947 in summer 1947 order prevent excess chartered boats staying traffic demoralizing traffic commission found necessary terminate require wanted keep ships new contract let say fully accord rights contract i think fully consistent policies act thank you,612.0,931,61,inaudible provide accelerated rate original contract mr barnett may i ask act 1946 specifically enacted purpose raising 50 rate  excess profits i thought said 1900 1936 act   50 the government could take 1936 yes yes well  what i  i wondering  contract chartering  ship what intention congress passing law far existing contracts concerned what purpose accelerating  part government voice overlap    excess profits that beginning wasnt well  congress called change oh i thought basing   upon intention congress inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible when inaudible mr barnett in  year and voice overlap  when first initial victory do recall 1957 inaudible well mr barnett  im little confused i guess i thought section 709 1936 act incorporated 1946 act am i correct and i thought that  said every charter made commission shall provide whenever end calendar year subject execution charter accum  cumulative net voyage profits payment charter hire   reserved charter payment charter fair reasonable overhead expenses applicable operation chartered vessels shall exceed 10 per annum charterers capital necessarily employed business chartered vessels charterer shall pay commission addition  additional charter hire onehalf cumulative net voyage profits excess 10   per annum now doesnt say must pay least 50 it says must pay onehalf onehalf thats  specifically brought 1946   act now read how  voice overlap  yes i beg pardon isnt profitsharing yes why say “and more” it says must make  no doesnt it says “must pay half” “half” now thats different saying  it must pay half   excess profit   10 what well doesnt say  this  doesnt say “half more” it says must pay half   excess profit voice overlap  so far  previous  pre1946 situation inaudible didnt   bid charters how set rates by bids but anyway many ways charter issued include 709 first right well isnt said 709   said  since 1936 hasnt and question question couldnt  whoever issuing charters also 709 youre correct prior 1946 put sliding scale 90 well think correct prior   1946 well would heavens sake the minimum well course course now  think prior 1946  before 5 b      commission puts sliding scale 90 and says “im 709” because provided i certainly   go beyond so need   decide 709 say limitation      you really go somewhere else voice overlap 709 well lets go back 5 b case but charter never did did   never  never referred 5 b never thought actually 5 b no commission case inaudible right whether 1936 act forbade commission get 50 voice overlap  inaudible inaudible get 50 profit wanted and new law old i thought old  i thought old written basis trying protect governments interest last notch inaudible competitive bidding get much   everything theyve sold   impossible get yes repealed has repealed its but law since thats forbidden government agencies get could companies and i understand   claim government maritime commission without authority law to get agree  mutually agree shipping company  certain price theyll inaudible profits theyll share so statute point to show that case do think profitsharing concerned 90 basic charter hire you dont care well commission purports say though 90 going figured basic charter hire  served i dont know  say  i think care commission thought well figuring charter hire  inaudible inaudible profitshare you said expressed inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible you read  inaudible grant authority 1946 except  except purpose  oh yes requirement it requires exercise authority nobody could challenge authority commission put  put provision charter even left you say voice overlap  what said inaudible mr barnett discretion  commission used  basic charge charter less 10 but get excess profits says shall pay half excess profits   government now isnt  isnt one  one place discretion doesnt now  where find i  i dont find unless inaudible prevails might disastrous shipping industry the commission might inaudible would much onerous sliding scale theres argument statute could delivered voice overlap inaudible well least inaudible government prevail inaudible and change policy the charter inaudible inaudible but im correct initial point theres argument inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible mr barnett i understand say opened argument really fight dollars past decision would perspective application under outstanding charter unless commission mean returned old   90   rate something like i thought said  commission never writ  gone entered charter without provisions just  only year included provisions well said  but since time issuing charters 50 mr barnett i understood say charter case terminated 1947 correct yes 1947 now accounting   adjustment suit brought there  did know long   completed is matter years through 1951 and two years that suit brought i beg pardon yes but  petitioner case actually paid charter according terms  and matter years two three years later   brought   brought suit and  there reservation contract the government this clause 13 when first district court decisions district   court appeals decision when begin come along not 1957 that first one 1956 and total 89 ill  i asked youve

Hyatt,9.0,0.0,0,972.0,1600,21,thank mr chief justice may please court section 145 patent act permits person sought patent pto believes agency wrongly denied application seek judicial review decision district court the federal circuit case held plaintiff section 145 action may obtain favorable standard review de novo review flouting ptos rules examination process under courts approach plaintiff may present court material new evidence refused failed without cause present pto and reward given de novo review ptos expert determinations relevant issues for three reasons unprecedented regime allowed stand first principles administrative deference exhaustion require pto given opportunity apply expert judgment reasonably available evidence for reason section 145 interpreted safety valve proceeding permits applicants introduce evidence court reasonably could presented pto no yes section 145 permits applicant dissatisfied decision pto no federal circuit held cases substantial evidence review applies federal circuit gets courts case morgan v daniels that action section 145s predecessor there new evidence case court held proceeding nature suit set aside judgment judgment expert agency made determination therefore administrative review deferential standard review apply so quite clear all material language there  material difference purposes case that correct justice ginsburg interference proceeding thats time section 145s predecessor applied equally interferences ex parte patent denials but courts reasonings discussion  predecessor statute distinguish based facts interference and also court well i think suggesting  145 actions new evidence morgan thorough conviction standard apply that reflects fact court needs look new evidence pto made expert determination court said morgan determination overturned unless high degree certainty and i would note that essentially court last term microsoft v i4i there court said third party challenging validity granted patent third party show invalidity based heightened burden proof clear convincing evidence and reflects wisdom  underlies certainly justice sotomayor i think district court characterize new evidence reason mr hyatt made concerted strategic decision present affidavit new evidence in form  factual evidence this declaration containing proffer testimony mr hyatt would offer trial so form factual evidence order take advantage possibility introducing new evidence section 145 action mr hyatt argued new factual evidence certainly i think whether  ultimate question whether written description sufficient question law it would one rests several subsidiary fact findings including ordinary skill art person ordinary skill art would understand reads specification specification support description support claims shows mr hyatt possessed invention claimed and i think look happened pto examiner said despite expertise i cant tell specification claims supported this 258  250page specification reprinted joint appendix it 100 pages diagrams source code 117 claims and pto asked information mr hyatt refused present didnt present rehearing board said had cause present new  new argument and point mr hyatt went 145 proceeding  characterized factual evidence order get around presumably would reasonable try get around boards ruling couldnt present new evidence now certainly could characterize legal argument we believe would win ground well even new argument certainly pto entitled enforce rules district court panel found pto abuse discretion  holding mr hyatt forfeited right raise argument but thats  thats additional question presented  added casespecific question but rate  entire case litigated basis factual evidence im sorry certainly i think clear would win ground the en banc court characterized new factual evidence applied rule  govern left stand 145 actions would permit applicants withhold evidence pto well 145 proceeding applicant ability introduce new evidence couldnt presented pto and i think well i think theres two primary categories important examination proceedings the first oral testimony the pto doesnt hear oral testimony routine examination procedures he could certainly bring district court yes now district court always general evidentiary rules say i believe evidence cumulative im going hear but extent district court believes would helpful hear oral testimony instance ptos determinations involve credibility decisions certainly district court could hear testimony thats often proceeding used there would reasonable justification presented the standard proposing district court discretion determine whether reasonable cause present evidence pto well i think different exhaustion forfeiture rules context the board applicant well certainly early cases took new evidence but 1952 congress reenacted provision lower courts applying morgan standard saying based morgans reasoning know pto primary fact finder know decision important apply limitations new evidence dont think that evidence well primary category evidence could come would evidence temporal component if lot evidence relevant patentability develops slowly might arise late process so instance obviousness common ground rejection but one thing relevant obviousness invention disclosed commercial success so type sales evidence develop late for part record closes  applicant files brief appeal board and months years board issues decision now there couple avenues applicant could still introduce new evidence even board considering appeal but process goes request continuing examination continuation application increasing sides require applicant abandon appeal give patent  patent term would presumably get well first instance ptos procedures actually provide actually provide situation thats board examiner enters new ground rejection then point applicant right reopen prosecution introduce new right yes im sorry this exception would apply new ground decision that something mr hyatt could tried take advantage he didnt he simply sought rehearing but event district court  district court carefully considered boards grounds rejection decided wasnt  werent new grounds rejection panel affirmed but get back difference 141 145 i think congress separated two proceedings 1927 before gotten appeal first record and bill equity 145 so congress separated 1927 appears legislative history concerned streamlining proceeding efficiency patent appeals so would reasonable conclude would number applicants probably majority applicants wouldnt new evidence could go 141 simply get final decision court one court proceeding court appeals but simply  number applicants important provide safety valve pto couldnt consider oral testimony certainly time oral testimony major concern interference proceedings would often two inventors saying i invented first no i invented first and would credibility fight so important time provide safety valve proceeding applicants yes morgan fact case like it appears applicants may done no i dont think would applicant new evidence time but i think  alternative treat 145 entirely de novo proceeding allows new evidence applicant failed without cause present pto thereby obtaining de nova review  evident policy justification congress provide well i think correct justice kennedy  en banc court believed administrative deference principles didnt weigh conclusions district court could give weight new evidence but adequate response dont think still de novo review so applicant introduces new evidence manner district court evaluates ptos conclusions entirely changed this longer deferential standard looking evidence this actually de novo review deference given ptos fact findings even evidence and dont think sensible way read statute basis text statute bifurcated standard would provide deferential thorough conviction review new evidence de novo well judge newmans position i think inconsistent morgan morgan section  revised statute 4915 action it 145 action new evidence and court said thorough conviction standard apply administrative review so hold 145 requires de novo review even new evidence would overrule morgan well i think morgan directly address  admissibility new evidence saying pto primary decisionmaker court lightly set aside pto invoked administrative deference principles turn show reasonably available evidence needs presented agency and  i think  wouldnt make sense de novo standard review patent denials time new evidence comes largely based courts decision microsoft there court rejected argument third party opportunity present evidence pto held high standard review so would particularly perverse say de novo review apply whenever patent applicant puts new evidence well i think presumption validity need give deference ptos determinations essentially two ways  saying thing as microsoft noted presumption  validity comes assumption agency presumed job thats judge ridge said and turn court said rca announced presumption validity relied morgan i think record support argument justice sotomayor see early twentieth century morgan construed administrative review  referred 1927 hearing there i think many people used phrase apa they referred mostly  contrast original action appeal and thats thing see early cases for instance globeunion referred de novo proceeding even said thorough conviction standard apply  new evidence limited administrative so i dont think place much weight use term de novo i think notable every time objection cases 1952 courts applied limitations new evidence dowling case referred dicta court discussed standard didnt actually apply and i think natural inference 1952 congress looked morgan looked cases viewed administrative review proceeding if i could reserve balance time thank this action judicial review agency determination this action requires patent applicant  seek property right agency denied challenge court and result court said zurko review agency determination therefore morgans deferential standard carried forward apa and construing morgan court zurko consider  whether property right awarded simply agency made determination expertise and i think goes would sufficient court simply weigh evidence differently in every agency  judicial review proceeding actions rule agency primary decisionmaker the agency consider evidence first make determination that aids judicial review it allows agency apply expertise and generally dont think court one make first determination issues fact well language statute morgan court construed judicial review and i think  would compelling reason order interpret statute permit agent  applicant  introduce evidence failed without cause  without justification provide agency and i dont think mr hyatt shown justification well i think certainly exhaustion requirement within statute the board considered application therefore would make sense board consider application didnt consider evidence provided so i think sense know standard federal circuit put place mr hyatt proposing really providing well language could taken suggest new evidence admissible i think look fact  like section 141 judicial review proceeding compelling reason deviate normal deferential standards apply  court reviewing agencys determination,857.0,1159,34,we hear argument next case 101219 kappos v hyatt ms anders can get 145 proceeding new evidence suppose i new evidence  i want challenge can i bring 145 right and basis court decide case de novo yes how close predecessor predecessor but morgan case involved  wasnt contest pto wouldbe patent holder interference proceeding wasnt i thought  interesting language morgan one companion cases companion sense heard time issue  radio city case  dont talk language today they dont talk deference dont talk substantial evidence they talk whether pto expertise presumptions fact findings based expertise overcome convincing evidence so talking different language concept talking one court accept findings pto matters involve expertise give weight  substantial weight essentially and overturn court words morgan radio city thoroughly convinced wrong so whats wrong standard everybody likes deference language today clear saying if pto made finding decide whether finding based expertise dont change court unless thoroughly convinced wrong is anything wrong with articulation standard situations whether new evidence new evidence let tell problem case it issue verizon raised lack connection district courts holding circuits court holding the district court excluded affidavit proposed arguments basis new arguments board rules precluded raising stage the circuit court described affidavit new evidence and verizon amicus brief says court careful really clear whats new evidence affidavit whats new argument and question troubles following reason verizon posits issue whether description specific enough legal question pto entitled deference why federal circuit patent board precedent right and explain affidavit rejected fact new evidence merely new argument could tell  form affidavit tell content new evidence i want get away labels i want get substance ive looked submissions sounds like i read briefs every day your case stronger isnt new facts right thats would say your case stronger fact new argument new fact ms anders one problems i think position sounds strange two proceedings one go directly federal circuit 101  141 one go district court thats as judge newman said whole new  whole new game  would congress create two judicial review routes one district court reviewable federal circuit directly federal circuit theres difference de novo review review agency ordinary standard reviewing agency action whats different  145 proceeding what kind evidence ms anders so 145 applicant take written affidavits say i want present oral testimony exact matters live but extent substance testimony something could brought pto testimony view would bounds there reasonable kind justification can work word equitable i mean equitable action could say  district court well course  assume win second question but first question onoff thing thats real objection de novo standard you say equitable actions generally individual allowed run around pto so better kind reason leave district courts work word equitable  seems lot shading cases cant quite tell new isnt new parts arent so leave district court say take account fact people allowed run around pto work equity thats kicking ball back now like let know if dont like tell    want absolute rule tell and says isnt cant hear i mean imagine youre sitting district judge think oh god presented key matter forever do i really pay attention now except history you history preapa section 145 apparently take evidence but really go back justice ginsburgs question understanding wouldnt reasonable opportunity present i mean very narrow its bunch cumulative testimony nobody would want present judge would want hear and basically saying circumstances well could done pto so justice ginsburgs problem which two channels exactly and beginning answer saying well cant oral testimony pto but else i asked would  whats different 141 145 view and said one thing oral testimony what else but i thought brief suggested even respect kind evidence person go back pto is right what new evidence reaction ptos ruling the pto says look  going issue patent didnt show us valve back thing whatever  novel think thats important and applicant goes 145 district court said well i didnt submit evidence i didnt idea that going significant issue i know sorry i good basis thinking is type new evidence could admitted so exception i thought telling us earlier generally cant get what evidence  oh please continue but said could go court 145 even new evidence well  in case would difference 141 145 go different court well judge newmans view en banc court took middle position often trial court evidence problems judge says well goes weight admissibility and seems thats judge  en banc majority saying fact presented points different direction pto found goes weight admissibility in words would give consideration fact wasnt introduced asked maybe discount result unless reason so depends facts case number one i reading i summarizing en banc majority correctly and number two isnt sensible way interpret statute justice ginsburg suggesting give meaning 145 it  performs function 141 well saying choose either position judge newmans position but im sure morgan little say types evidence ought admitted proceeding and one thing could separate two things say know think basis one lets say giving government fairly deferential standard review  call clear convincing call thorough conviction  go way rule evidentiary point morgan says nothing but i dont know that  i think youre confusing nature review de novo new burdens attach proof those two different concepts and thats microsoft said dont confuse burdens standards review that de novo review one thing even de novo review often give weight presumptive weight facts opposed others and thats i think morgan talking morgan clear whether new evidence give  accept valid whatever pto require thoroughly convinced new evidence wrong i dont know standard cant apply situation i think thats judge newman intended although didnt say so confusing standard review burden i two problems argument the first i know may unique many colleagues say dont rely legislative history but im relying legislative history im relying legislative history replete commissioner patents saying section 145 required de novo review and witness witness tried argue congress change it didnt arguing required de novo review second cases repeatedly describe de novo review so got get past and got get past 1927 1945 barrett side but plenty courts including second circuit respected jurist learned hand saying exclude new evidence principles estoppel someone intentionally withheld evidence pto so deal record doesnt basic  doesnt support basic argument thank counsel mr panner seems strange statute i dont know statute  reads way as facts  facts  as facts may  facts case may appear  thats well i guess compelling reason statutory language especially respect admissibility evidence question i mean  standard suggest cant derived statutory language isnt right but doesnt court say said if  court congress  admit congress intended section 145 action permit new evidence wanted limit evidence something could found due diligence whatever limitations speak broadly i mean statutory language suggests pto as law  equity might permit this broad language thank counsel the case submitted,1202.0,1678,14,mr chief justice may please court the language section 145 structure judicial review provisions patent act long history provision courts constructions predecessors make clear governments argument plaintiff barred introducing new evidence action section 145 except unusual extraordinary circumstance applicant opportunity introduce substance evidence incorrect section 145 follow modern norm ontherecord review such review afforded sections 141 144 and principle administrative law supports governments opportunity standard situations congress authorized trial de novo obtain relief adverse agency action yes your honor well your honor clear permitted section 145 correct new evidence permitted go issues properly ruled pto course ruling ex parte application the reason appeals federal circuit quite common often issue basis rejection legal issue and issues theres de novo review federal circuit the federal circuit ruling legal issues time event it really circumstance factual question new evidence relevant applicant avail well your honor evidence wanted present remedies pto inadequate one reason another but thinking practical implications procedural option section 145 affords important recognize procedure place generations understood patent bar reflected decisions well i think number cases involving rejections taken court somewhat limited part applicants often adequate remedy pto but circumstance final  board action case like one   i  ground rejection meaning technical grounds grounds written description identified examiners decision  reasoning justified rejection quite new decision board  factual evidence applicant wanted submit general district court permit district court understand specification support your honor  ms anders referring i believe possibility reopen new grounds rejection there new grounds still written description rejection the applicant argue appeal filing rehearing explanation board provided one able discern examination  examiners rejection and look record case examiner said support lacking features  board eventually affirm explanation element missing why feature supported specification the board provided reasoned explanation applicant tried respond board refused accept right well really two points your honor with respect standard review separate question admissibility evidence standard review apa says trial de novo standard whether finding unwarranted facts 2f well i think i think goes justice sotomayors point really trial de novo clearly minimum courts talking refer five times ten times dozens times court several times lower courts pervasively talking de novo proceeding talking fact applicant introduce new evidence attempt overcome adverse action entered okay and question becomes appropriate standard review new evidence going question and answer goes i think section 2f says  question whether warranted facts there question weight may afforded particular agency  agency determination at minimum fact rejection shifts burden when applicant goes pto assumption entitlement patent unless pto show applicant entitled patent so burden pto once proper rejection agency board ruled applicant bears burden so minimum shifting and applicant would bear burden practical matter federal circuit indicated district judge weigh evidence including new evidence findings agency making determination whether applicant carried burden show hes entitled patent yes your honor i your honor that say federal circuit recognized determining weight give new evidence determining weight give determined  prior determination agency appropriate district court look circumstances new evidence 1 things inequitable  equitable action and course judge sitting without jury in microsoft obviously concern court shifting standards proof would confusing jury could lead collateral litigation where district judge making determination factual issue district judge practical matter quite reasonably determine board board decide basis strongly supported versus   extent new evidence something really requires look anew i dont think entirely unique your honor that say example proceedings orders pay money fcc findings agency given prima facie weight action  enforcement action and new evidence permitted district judge would make determination based record new evidence but party agency seeking enforce prior order would able rely factual findings  prima facie evidence contrary evidence would actually establish facts there administrative review schemes afford trial de novo may less deference whatever agency depending record may reflect considered judgment agency well your honor i think principle estoppel recognized barrett one challenging that say circumstance applicant course interference proceeding perhaps easier foresee happening interference context case plaintiff actually suppressed directed witnesses answer questions went particular factual area and  appeal district court action brought attempted introduce evidence  applicant deliberately suppressed and district court said look  gives rise estoppel seems generally applicable principle i think difficulty your honor is inconsistent practice courts always recognized also ignores fact needs decisions applicant makes evidence present pto and may good cause presenting evidence pto becomes quite relevant well your honor would certainly meet good cause standard case thing i think difficult standard could potentially lead sorts collateral litigation in typical case example applicant seek introduce new expert testimony either was  additional whatever issue offered pto often expert testimony offered ex parte application justice sotomayor clear proper standard one  permit exclusion evidence good cause present it the standard  think supported cases one would permit introduction evidence federal circuit said consistent rules evidence civil procedure thats principles estoppel reflected ordinary equity practice administrative review context would  would applicable could lead and i think looking cases decided 1952 everyone seems  agree  magic date furthest court went decision barrett and interesting panel decision case also relied idea barrett not in court  court appeals your honor exclusion evidence barrett case involved directing witness answer suppression inquiry particular factual area applicant  changing story claiming different date reduction practice different basis reduction practice argued pto  attempted introduce evidence suppressed so thats different circumstance and courts  decisions actually pains say barrett overread the third circuit carborundum case said nichols case weve cited brief said course pointed judge hand observed  dowling case globeunion said even cases government relied accepted evidence despite arguments made defendants cases evidence excluded could presented and  consider and brings us i think   lot discussion morgan standard review morgan say and critical point court recognized microsoft morgan one early cases  radio corporation another depend idea presumption validity course adopted congress section 282 statutory presumption given common law meaning required clear convincing evidence but clear convincing evidence overcome grant property right defendant cases what critical morgan fact patent office granted patent defendant challenge validity patent plaintiffs case relied and  thats absolutely clear court cites johnson v towsley case involving land grant and court says presumption executive power give property rights dont get review now case see limited exception statute actually tells us exception going limited but look morgan relies morgan relying agency expertise relying agency authority different matter and  authority agency grant property right in  conception  court 1893 administrative law existed 1893 fact property right challenged action effort overcome rejection means idea presumption validity rights granted executive department doesnt come play there rights granted executive department new proceeding quote professor merrills article court whole case  and really reflected language congress chose now course  differences congress provided section 145 modern administrative review lead  questions there question know standard new evidence which  know your honor judge newman said   findings de novo section 145 action  majority en banc court said new evidence  relying federal circuit held many years new evidence standard would substantial evidence standard would apply appeal we havent taken position let suggest might right your honor which section 141 section 144  court  know held zurko situation new evidence  aside zurko emphasized morgan case new evidence  case thats new evidence apa standard  review substantial evidence arbitrary capricious review applied and might  might sort narrow circumstance apply de novo standard even though may otherwise suggested language section 145 would create anomaly  court recognized zurko right i  i dont think im sure and your honor i think standard proof one  preponderance evidence and question weight federal circuit said weight afford prior finding pto would depend record showed that  facts case may appear section 145 it requires district court look findings look new evidence make determination as section  i say language morgan deals circumstance challenge validity issued patent the action issue action validity challenged denial patent applicant fact pto issued patent defendant case and collateral attack effectively collateral challenge validity issued patent and radio corporation america cites morgan thats know relevant  courts know decision microsoft statutory presumption validity carries heightened standard proof i think  i understand concern practicalities patent prosecution practice applicant would hold back evidence effort   produce sort tactical advantage i think  frankly straightforward easier try meet objections office thats usually happens theres dialogue examiner try meet grounds rejection one things i think important respect context case vast number rejections there rejection writtendescription enablement grounds rejections double patentings rejections anticipation rejections obviousness and every single one  every single one  grounds rejection overcome appeal board and many writtendescription rejections overcome appeal board and   respect every one  one goes back reads examiners decision examiner provide explanation lacking respect certain elements claimed invention respect every single one board reversed so applicant provided fair opportunity try meet concerns applicant board ruled favor and attempted  question sandbagging the  applicant brought arguments board rehearing petition  request rehearing  said heres answer focused explanation   refused hear so practical matter i think  dont take word procedure place long problems arisen and even uncertainty precise standard admissibility applicants would every reason test  try something along line realistic option favorable the fact matter that happened applicants every reason world pursue application vigor office and federal circuit course familiar patent application process court concerns rule adopting would lead abuses thats right your honor well your honor cant well your honor wouldnt record if record presumably  issue would presented would quite similar the time i see  words different record true federal circuits review district decision would  would difference court recognized zurko it would court  court standard review  gives perhaps slightly less weight decision district court court agency review but doesnt seem like advantage in  circumstance least applicant prevailed applicant would likely see victory taken away federal circuit unless court questions thank your honor,450.0,664,23,the problem i submission say basically two routes get review denial patent office the first 141 appeal federal circuit right situation youre limited record agency lost and deference agency ruled under 145 add new evidence could address questions pto raised saying dont  havent dealt valve back could say well heres new evidence dealing there deference agency and extent pick judge want hear extent  why would anybody proceed section 141 instead 145 so  every case anything purely legal issue would go 145 yes i know thats i  im really confused i take people dont often use 145 right they almost always appeal federal circuit well ms  ms anders told us theres procedure pto lets deal  sort something came didnt think address do think  terms question standard review i somewhat  i would like response approach that theres ambiguity i mean going win ambiguity but ambiguity i think 1946 makes difference that preceding time every agency went way dozens specialized methods review and whole purpose 50 years administrative law try create uniformity across agencies vast federal government and obviously worrying first case case chipping away and hard lawyers ordinary people understand suddenly go back create specialized rules favor agency always wants specialized rule course think terribly important im sure but thats i saying ambiguity standard review go uniformity that begs question sense interlinked i mean reasons would support trial de novo even introduce new evidence it old trial new evidence thousand different variations theme all right new part  i get if judge does articulate weight gives pto finds does say i give deference i give substantial deference this discussed page 9 brief summarized majority opinion en banc court and connection line agree summary well line justice breyers question give us example agency review proceeding somewhat like this unique are limits new evidence produced are limits view well willing accept broadening prevent people running around pto simply saying unless  unless person potential patentee unless wants  unless shown show innocent say wasnt deliberate wasnt negligent wasnt part trial strategy unless shows totally without sin form words introducing evidence first time cant introduce well say say unless show good cause introduced pto court wont consider so give us standard  good cause somehow willing accept different governments reasonable cause standard and equity seems required intentional bad faith withholding want limit what do sort  the intentional grossly negligent and see limits estoppel principal  equity principal i think thats justice breyer really  referring what would contours equity limits thats little bit unfair characterize cases limited some talked negligence and courts said intentional there debate back forth yes i agree and i think taking position judge newman i think  didnt say new evidence introduced 145 proceeding court engages apastyle review and  and agree i noticed it seems introducing gamesmanship anybody wanted get substantial deference apa present expert thats  thats makes little sense trying  hairsplitting minute way articulate standard would  one suggesting total de novo review deference kind presumption applied pto decision another way look way i suggested doesnt matter new evidence level respect going give pto factual findings be  language morgan convinced pto wrong suppose lawyer back chief justices question client thinking know prints evidence pto say i mean but hold back something well going get  going get de novo review district court boy  but obvious holding back something run estoppel rule my goodness youre  youre mess seems trying advise client situation better say hold something back hand pretty  deal you see because  im sorry go ahead i guess practical matter things end federal circuit anyway right and i suppose case one coming 141 one 145 i suppose theoretically possible could reach different results different standards review no i know im saying  point although come federal circuit may come different posture would cause federal circuit rule differently case one thank mr panner ms anders 3 minutes

religious freedom restoration act allow they adhere religious beliefs pay millions dollars penalties take steps believe religiously morally objectionable government deems necessary provide contraception coverage health care plans now government concedes sincerity religious beliefs attempts recast objection act opting objecting and due respect simply demonstrably true the little  oh i  i dont think justice sotomayor but let stick conscientious objector example draft context i think way analyze conscientious objector case say face jail time theres clearly substantial burden of course get second part analysis probably would insist conscientious objector actually objecting but i think important distinguish  okay i think would i think would difficult administer kind system either couldnt even know objection couldnt take steps governments part fill spot but i think whats critical  well two things your honor one perhaps unique government program government provide exemption without actually requiring somebody opt thats exactly churches integrated auxiliaries religious orders  that  well first your honor thats true respect churches integrated auxiliaries religious orders stick knitting engage religious activity so factually theres distinction but i think important thing your honor i would distinguish situation somebody objection opting governments going take wholly independent steps find somebody fill spot conscientious objector objects objecting form way object list name somebody else whos drafteligible obligated serve stead i would  i would delighted  delighted justice kennedy my point simply clients object objecting and part reason know shy objecting they told government regulatory process making mistake eliminated true exemption religious orders orders stuck purely religious things and client little sisters could go serve elderly poor nondenominational basis thats dont qualify exemption so objected they objected filed lawsuit they reaffirmed objection filed notice necessary comply courts interim objection two things justice kagan first would qualify substantial burden objection requirement enforced massive penalties and thats relatively rare situation   i understand justice kagan that brings second part answer i think right way understand hypothetical  i explaining justice kennedy hypothetical well i dont think thats position our position  sincerity religious beliefs the government question theyve conceded there legal analysis substantial burden substantial burden analysis case clear millions dollars penalties exact penalties issued hobby lobby and court said easy case substantial burden  well im trying  im trying due respect brings  everything else brings second part rfra analysis and i would think objection contrary fact absolutely object objecting come government  based objection government provides service exchanges title x aetna uberpolicy everybody gets contraceptives overall government policy fact object none things but i think would lose second half rfra analysis i think thats right analysis well i think clients objection distinguishable hypothetical objecting objecting i mean maybe one way understand fact two forms one optout form one authorization form clients would objection signing optout form they would much objection authorization form and government  i dont think based courts precedents either even im wrong could certainly write opinion says three legs stool case there fact government demands objection fact enforces massive penalties reality happens going hijack health plans provide coverage two things  two things justice sotomayor the first i think youre saying government able function substantial burden least restrictive alternative analysis thats exactly justice scalia said court smith decision and justice oconnor took different view and healthy debate and question better debate question side debate settled things justice sotomayor action involved thirdparty action like part bowen roy case lyng case youre right thats substantial burden but government says  needs i want clear i the government admits pages 87 89 brief need know raise hand opt they also need additional information insurer tpa so require so   dont  thats say need justice ginsburg thats true provide form information form the government treats form authorization in case selfinsured plans tpa  it makes difference justice ginsburg if dont provide form coverage doesnt flow we havent provided form cases result coverage hasnt flowed the government thinks  i think obvious respect selfinsured plans true the government thinks needs something us take something make plan document i agree justice ginsburg call accomodation doesnt mean immune rfra analysis and gave clients gave 345000 churches integrated auxiliaries purely religious activities religious orders gave accomodation client wed fill form wanted but problem fill form consequence us filling form treated differently religious employers in cases your honor becomes plan instrument i think  know government thinks notification case functional equivalent ebsa 700 form reason required form  shows really opt way regulations originally designed didnt raise hand tell government i object you sent form directly insurer directly tpa treated permission slip provide coverage well thats actually still one ways apply  well alternative thanks court interim relief file objection government treats exactly way all thats different essentially  mailing rule they take objection provide objection thirdparty administrator least selfinsured plans becomes every bit much plan document ebsa form 700 and due respect little rich government say this isnt plan dont worry whole interest put terms seamless coverage if seamless enduser i dont think little sisters perception seamless fact complicit irrational belief stretch thats  i think thats fair description justice kennedy and i think problem government understanding position that health plan somewhat intangible and i think put tangible terms  consequence us filing form would come one little sisters homes set shop room could pay us rent wouldnt cost us thing and operated title x clinic homes i think everyone would understand course complicit coverage thats provided premises and intangible i dont think principle different certainly perspective  i think thats role courts court i think dont want get role truth detector test  thats hobby lobby decision that goes back thomas decision if remember decision religious adherent objection formulating cylindrical tanks  cylindrical things would go tanks now another jehovahs witness record said you dont need object thats big deal its attenuated and court specifically said were going get business refereeing disputes going get business trying figure secondguessing whether mr thomas really correctly misunderstanding faith now ton amicus briefs reinforce religious beliefs issue little sisters clients idiosyncratic know wrong matter faith but thats area get i think  yeah i im going try justice breyer im going try reserve time rebuttal so i would say youre exactly right smith much administrable world congress  absolutely so heres way work draw line you first ask substantial burden religious exercise that going weed claims if i trying claim tax wine example  no no im trying tell thats one step it weed claims i think theres going work done second half test i think fairly obvious differences regime essentially government actions showed people cant opt its important its universal and come case like like sherbert the thing made sherbert easy case government south carolina already taken care sunday objectors so point argument whole system would collapse take care sabattarians particularly persuasive argument here theyve taken care churches theyve taken care religious order like little sisters little sisters wouldnt go care elderly poor theyve demonstrated easy case i reserve time mr chief justice may please court the government interest respect every employee country doesnt get contraceptive coverage employerbased plan yet employees government tells us furthers interest ways the government therefore needs prove ways somehow insufficient comes petitioners employees sum total showing case limited less one column one page federal register that simply insufficient government demand organizations like catholic charities little sisters poor engage conduct agree regard sinful instead religious employer definition organizations get fullblown exemption opposed organizations like petitioners gives fullblown exemption organizations even dont object providing contraceptive coverage treats identical organizations differently youve got catholic school west side town comply no your honor im necessarily suggesting but case look government fact done particular look congress fact done fact line congress drawn both title vii exemption churches like houses worship religious organizations like clients get treated like tax exemption regime here governments entire line drawn tax world line   define file informational tax returns  your honor i dont think context regime i dont think government take position little sisters poor less core quoteunquote church house worship time  excuse your honor i think university yes your honor look congress drawn lines universities get title vii exemption  religious hiring churches the little sisters  not quite your honor i think problem government draw definition coherent rational and i think problem theyve drawn definition tax regime doesnt comply carry regime in tax world churches universities little sisters poor file informational tax return actually get exact exemption  and your honor suggesting what suggesting government interest employees country dont get coverage  employerbased plan  religious employers its grandfathered plans in addition selfemployed unemployed employees small businesses the government interest respect organizations and your honor clear i suggesting whenever give exemption churches exemption apply religious organizations what i suggesting government interest respect religious secular employees churches religious employers employees small businesses employees grandfathered plans government furthers interest respect employees many ways  whether affordable care act exchanges whether title x whether medicare medicaid  minimum government needs explain ways sufficient employees yet  not your honor but i saying title vii exemption said cant discriminate basis race unless youve preexisting policy race discrimination case maintain case perpetuity long dont change thats fine i think would undermine  purpose title vii and thats precisely type exemption contraceptive mandate justice alito could could many things well well your honor i think  and justice sotomayor i think goes larger problem governments case utter absence evidence lets assume sake argument  but justice sotomayor problem problem seamlessness whether call problem burdensomeness thats problem exists respect employers petitioners employees respect every employee like petitioners employees also  because i think means one two things either government willing tolerate problems identifies petitioners employees respect employees grandfathered plans  understand 44 million  respect  respect employees small businesses respect employees religious employers unemployed selfemployed either theyre willing  theyre willing tolerate problems people really question whether compelling interest forcing particular petitioners comply but flip side suggest briefs actually willing tolerate problem respect people instead think interest ways question becomes why ways sufficient people suddenly insufficient comes petitioners employees and thats fundamental breakdown governments side case more generally i think see absence evidence many critical issues lets assume sake argument knew size problem many women actually lack access contraceptive coverage and dont know answer and lets assume knew much problem would reduced forcing organizations like petitioners comply would reduce 1 percent 15 percent 50 percent and dont know we still dont know whether government could achieve comparable reduction less burdensome means less burdensome means says sufficient interests respect employees like petitioners employees dont get contraceptive coverage employerbased plan i dont think thats right your honor first grandfather plan transition rule it contains sunset provision it allows  its got lower first couple years leveled last two years   25 percent yes your honor except allow  allow employees raise copayments rate medical inflation without losing status allow continue adding employees plan without losing grandfathered status i think partly explains leveled 25 percent last couple years but even putting aside i think youve drawn massive exemption secular religious reasons tends undermine  tends one two things either shows interest really isnt compelling youre allowing  youre willing tolerate whole bunch bad stuff whole bunch people  i dont think thats really means i think means government telling us got interest respect grandfathered employees  no  your honor i think means government claims interest overwhelming interest force petitioners  organizations like petitioners violate sincerely held religious beliefs yes says going exempt organizations purely secular reasons organizations political reasons organizations religious reasons  sure your honor sure your honor but i think  and justice breyer finelygrained factual  factual issues  but  i think youre looking regime like one religious exemptions large exemptions totally nonreligious reasons exact problem government claims petitioners present respect employees country like petitioners employees dont  and id agree thats tough line i think  i dont think theres clear line things  require things dont require  i think way law works  i think way law works says allowed require particular thing violates beliefs and making decision look  government treating similar situations and government fact saying respect people also dont get coverage employers willing tolerate else willing address issue ways rfra answer look ways see whether theyre sufficient employees whether theyre uniquely insufficient employees your honor accommodations weve listed briefs would acceptable  your honor submitting notification notification got treatment religious employers notification would acceptable your honor possibly possibly i could explain weve offered kind alternative consider i think distance put petitioners one hand provision objectionable coverage employees the less problematic particular perspective sure easily enough distance file notice objection government furthers interest way furthers interest respect employees dont get coverage employerbased plan the employees  association  not necessarily your honor again mr clement saying uberinsurance policy aetna company government picked provide contraceptive coverage women country happened use aetna i think wed probably fine yes your honor but problem seize control  uhhuh and justice ginsburg im trying careful many clients many different views but i think general matter i could certainly see case theyre seizing control plans plans required provide threat penalty using plans vehicle delivering objectionable coverage employees solely long theyre enrolled plans i could certainly see many clients would view substantial burden religious beliefs we turn less restrictive alternatives and your honor ill conclude quite clear government alternatives alternatives uses everybody else and alternatives fine least need evidence explaining theyre fine us well thank mr chief justice a points rebuttal id like start universities justice kennedy i dont think case congress exempts churches exempt universities what needs though rationale drawing line now friend side says line doesnt perfect well compelling interest least restrictive alternatives least pretty good and line drawn absurd i would urge look amicus brief filed dominican sisters authored former head tax division explains line picked using 6033 tax code makes sense thats informative filing requirement substantive difference if clients filed form get tax exempt status churches the difference provision whether filed form the substantive treatment exactly to use line draw distinction churches universities little sisters poor terrible line draw and go back thinking  no i would say that gets next point but i could finish point one second their original justification line drew justice kennedy exempted organizations would likely hire coreligionists therefore less likely employees would use products my clients equally enjoy title vii exemption gives right hire coreligionists original rationale applies equally clients you draw sensible line now exemptions i mean i respectfully disagree professor laycock let answer questions together first exemption limited churches it applies religious orders and clients would stuck knitting helped elderly poor could qualify but answer questions together exemptions created equal and professor laycock great scholar even admitted didnt understand details particular plan he didnt get he left parties and i think subsequently said really requirement entities contract even would recognize substantial burden but important point exemptions created equal if create exemption small employers thats rationale exercise enforcement discretion if create exemption  take o centro case if exemption peyote schedule 5 substance less dangerous maybe government would their problem government already exempted sacramental use peyote schedule 1 substance so course hard time arguing couldnt provide exemption different schedule 1 substance all exemptions treated justice breyer there excuse there way hard work looking exemptions seeing whether make sense one cases congress clearly wanted embrace rfra yoder now yoder relatively hard case basically exemptions if state wisconsin already provided exemption mennonites already provided exemption students upstate schools farther apart yoder would easy easy case you cant make exemption grandfathered plans and please sunset provision if look joint appendix page 956 link grandfather provision idea like plan keep so thats going away just closing clients would love conscientious objector government insists conscientious collaborator there thing,1360.0,1785,27,well hear argument morning case 141418 zubik v burwell consolidated cases mr clement could explain analogy military objectors war many felt  genuine belief pacifists  registered pacifists that would mean people would serve lieu they going jail many go jail belief why going jail less burdensome less important paying financial penalty lets stop to extent conscientious objectors good faith belief if i register someone serve lieu burden government meaning  youre looking terms strict scrutiny government sends many notices people come serve ten  know 1000 1200 do really think makes difference knows whether one person going show and going road whats difference would law survive well isnt thing if dont know pay  whos eligible whos eligible pay system work the churches tell us church plans  tell government church plans somebody tell government whos eligible eligible how different military service well client  you   began mr clement saying government mischaracterizes position i quite sure argument taking us youre getting specifics could begin   talking laughter well mr clement might but happens somebody object objecting it seems arguments would apply way in words somebody comes says i object objecting objecting make easier government fill slot thats perfectly understandable thing say and thats part sincere religious belief and say sincere religious belief controls and would seem theory would say thats substantial burden even objecting objecting yes yes i mean penalties person objecting objecting and thats part religious belief make likely government able fill slot take efforts know  provide contraceptives well hypothetical thats directly implicated theory case theory case says everything depends person coming saying religion endall beall youre answering question so i understand answer person sincere religious belief objecting objecting form complicity would control would go second part analysis say compelling interest test has governments response narrowly tailored but essentially objecting  difference objecting objecting clients position difference respect burden analysis i guess im saying mr clement i understand factual distinction youre making factual distinction doesnt matter given legal analysis what i dont understand mr clement government law someone claims burdens practice ever insubstantial because every believer thats ever come us including people military saying soul damned way im naysaying that substantial perceived personal burden but thats always going substantial ever government functions how ever anything government demand people objecting   wont problem well side debate settles asking anything except identify going action either government third party thats balance struck substantial burden someone else going act youre objecting but   tpa who insurer thats and independent contract the insurer tpa dealing employer it independent obligation imposed government  company its authorization the government  law  regulation requires it doesnt matter whether say yes and could say i fill form i authorize i permit it wont make difference because government another interest stake  one thing said i want clear involved no one doubts moment sincerity belief client others and since sincerity belief accepted table sincerity belief parents roy case questioned in none cases issue thats accepted but government acted case know  original health care plan didnt provide covered services women saw compelling interest need marginally ignored so things cant way there accomodation thats government tried it doesnt  you started talk  started talk selfinsured plans is case form notice hhs instance becomes plan instrument and thats yes dont you notify government is  essence argument  objection contraceptive coverage  done health insurance contract do accept  clients view complicity polygraph analysis see far causation go do accept view complicity see whether accomodation possible thats least restrictive are finished all right i  you must thought question i suspect ill assume i want assume purposes question isnt matter signing form objection your  clients involved health care plan major ways they probably figure  sign papers every five months every day choose insurers they kinds things and topping icing cake pushes edge fill form saying i object insurer contact employees da da da da da its whole bunch things all right so question putting together protected rfra i think reason court went sherbert verner smith couldnt figure apply sherbert verner and sherbert verner rfra picks and least one difficulty im going and ive even read st benedict you know  religious purposes im trying find something member society sometimes religious person whos hermit monk member society accept kinds things terrible think quakers quakers object vietnam think people object laws protecting blasphemy think people object shoveling snow front walk lead abortion clinic think christian scientists know report accident child go hospital adult receive medical care religion so loads things ive given four think taxes well theres question doesnt violate religious clause but plenty things so whats line why quakers pay taxes vietnam dont find religious jew muslim getting extra day week law says nobody work sunday sabbath saturday what line and ive reading reading try find fairly clear simple statement line works and repeat difficulty sherbert verner rfra quite honestly doesnt help but might then  tell work no quaker quaker you think wasnt substantial burden thank counsel mr francisco are suggesting category church organization religiouslyoriented organization come within category church the government cant treat church special give exemption doesnt give religiousoriented organizations yes government could that government say going treat church ultra protected religiousoriented organizations protected level the university the university well youre answering really affirmative  justice ginsburgs question once give  church give religious organization thats  thats position its going difficult court write opinion says church organization treat religious university i find difficult write i thought  strong tradition country comes religious exercises churches special  know said recently hosannatabor long line cases says theres something special churches and  youre saying every time congress gives exemption churches synagogues mosques open religious people effect congress decides give exemption and thats people extremely strong rfra supporters deserted cause right professor laycock among mortal danger poses churches but grandfather traditional there many statutes grandfather provisions  theyre transitional and many statutes  treat small enterprises differently are  saying government makes  recognizes exempts law small business small business number like title vii 15 employees thats the floodgates open  open exemption small business everyone couldnt congress perhaps executive survey employees churches  religious nonprofits categories religious nonprofits little sisters big university determine percentage employees groups members religion draw distinction among groups based  survey couldnt congress well could also  dont assume part  majority part religion going buy contraceptives thats religious tenet and worried case we worried women dont adhere particular religious tenant  perceive government determined real need contraceptives what utter absence plenty evidence relied upon show contraceptives provided women seamless way number unintended pregnancies dramatically falls number abortions and health risk women want contraceptives cant get proven scientifically otherwise but know exempt certain employers certain size title vii dont believe racial discrimination bad thing committed eradicating problem certain point assumed society government cant everything so cant take care health needs hundred percent women significant number why judgment entitled respect mr francisco i admit quite understanding argument  seems though important laws laws serve compelling interests  often exceptions there often small business exceptions there often transition rules like grandfathering provision and every time existed somebody could come say well government must really believe law exception state  allows people  i mean might well pack theres law town doesnt exceptions like its lower lower every single year if make change  if make change health plan youre grandfather every employer going make changes health plan so diminishing  transitional period once make change plan youre grandfather here incentives would put place mr francisco you would saying congress congress next time pass law dont put exemption churches youre going get real trouble dont write transition rules help people adjust new legal regime youre going get real trouble dont write exemptions small businesses even though particular concerns small businesses face youre going get trouble now terrible incentives give legislature i see point  lets imagine widespread government program filled exemptions there smaller group people need exemption religious reasons we look exemptions some seem good reasons seem terrible reasons we  really rfra first amendment exempt religious right okay ive described united states tax code know exemption religiously objecting example paying taxes would support war okay so  thats im looking same question and im asking refute im asking im looking distinction actually and reason i said i dont think distinction well youve exempted people exempt religious people but would run throughout government united states so  know distinction least  i believe you tell theres  i want know think no theyre all right well go ahead you want say i got youre going exemptions thats thrust question the thrust i havent found yet i want find real distinction whether call rfra call smith i dont care call im trying find basis distinction things require people despite religious objection things dont and want think theres difference read  youve read neubornes brief lists two pages some go one way go way he says people involved that might answer whats answer what  right line give hint direction laughter mr francisco may  may i ask question is accomodation government would offer would fact result women employees clients students clients getting health care part employerbased plan studentbased plan getting contraceptive coverage is accomodation would acceptable no no through  words   object notification is kind notification would acceptable no the religious employers employees get contraceptive coverage employerbased plan im suggesting  im asking whether theres accommodation would result women employees getting contraceptive coverage seamlessly employerbased plan would find acceptable well might acceptable puts enough distance so answer justice kagan wrong basically youre saying even optout i raise hand i tell im religious objector somehow suit know thirdparty administrator general law requires erisa plans insurance companies tell clients insurer involved way object paid government but justice kagans question college students want get coverage  available conditions you   far i understand youre saying it plan government buys  government provides plan long connect insurer   insuring religious organization as long insurer linked students get something else it cant get students get health protection thank counsel general verrilli but going back linedrawing problem  brief thats mentioned several times baptist joint committee  leading proponent rfra discusses linedrawing problem do say thats wrong would better say churches youve got tell us youre going claim exemption every church religious religious tenets so would preferred is  sort incentive want put is message youre giving lots rules apply differently churches recognize special others may special like clear tell church thank counsel the case submitted,1583.0,2595,40,mr chief justice may please court the accommodation petitioners challenge case strikes precisely sensible balance religious liberty compelling governmental interests congress sought enacted rfra as court recognized hobby lobby accommodation seeks respect religious liberty petitioners exempting contraceptive  contraceptive requirement respect interest petitioners employees  we concede theres substantial burden justice kennedy we  concede religious belief sincere were questioning sincerity belief dont think case   question religious objection made independent arrangements government makes third parties fill regulatory gap created granting exemption  generally applicable rule that qualifies  no so look im  im happy discuss substantial burden i want go i think critical point question rfra scrutiny applies apply mr francisco spent lot time talking various alternatives government might able use instead accommodation i think theres real problem every single one every single one defeats purpose congress imposed preventive services requirement respect contraception respect preventive services and point i think see look relevant statutory provision find page 4a appendix brief preventive services  preventive services provision point provision group health plan ie health plan covers people employer individual health insurance coverage ie kind coverage thats sold exchanges shall include cost free preventive services the whole point provision whole point ensure people got health insurance would get preventive services part regular care regular doctor barriers yes i understand your honor but assuming moment  im happy discuss substantial burden  assuming moment rfra scrutiny substantial burden point im making i think critical  none options petitioners identified going exchange buying separate individual policy contraceptive coverage policy title x medicare medicaid respect every one youd change law make even eligible but even could change law every single one creates problem congress trying solve provision would require setting oneoff jerryrigged separate channel get contraceptive coverage i understand mr chief justice i understand thats position let engage question whether constitutes substantial burden we think doesnt constitute substantial burden way accommodation structured although youre quite right seeks perspective employee ensure employee gets protection congress designed perspective employer provided separate program no were saying judgment complicity objective limit rfra recognizes scope cognizable burden that true presmith case law rfra recognized lyng bowen cases doubt  well i said your honor rfra scrutiny applies certainly least restrictive alternative it precisely problem its less restrictive alternative precisely problem congress trying overcome preventive services provision no your honor yes course for reason employee go get separate policy even world doesnt exist policies cant sold exchanges  but even hypothetical world equally effective achieving governments interest whole point provision get care regular doctor part regular health care without barriers including copay barriers and i think  think  consider please perspective woman employee she health plan employer she goes  goes doctor regular doctor she may medical condition makes pregnancy danger she may one women 15 percent prescribed contraception needs contraception treat medical condition maybe wants contraception thats appropriate what happens  petitioners regime doctor say  regular doctor say sorry i cant help its dont get paid  prescription paid cant write prescription cant counsel educate patient because wouldnt regular doctor shed go buy separate plan find doctor willing take separate plan assuming  assuming course insurance companies willing sell separate  but whole point justice alito congress wanted eliminate  even perceived small barriers like 5 10 copay medical experts said even though small barriers  even youre getting part regular coverage even small barriers work sufficient disincentive many fewer people use contraception would otherwise  barrier  system your honor positing imposes significantly greater barrier even  well  so grandfathered plans lets talk as i  i answer your honors question directly i think broader context matters this transitional device the number people grandfathered plans dropped 50 percent there reason think going continue drop continue drop pace last four years well zero soon your honor congress passed americans disabilities act made  didnt impose immediate requirement every building retrofitted access disabled possible what said context feasible buildings shall retrofit new buildings shall access requirements no one would say government lacks compelling interest enforcing americans disabilities act congress decided transitional system this big program there reliance interests congress decided transition it understood number going drop dramatically time you want  good place know going drop dramatically time look declaration dioceses pittsburgh page 86 joint appendix say sticking grandfathered plan dont want trigger contraceptive coverage requirement costing us fortune we change and thats reality thats going go and respect contraception your honor grandfathered plan says  institute medicine study record said contraceptive coverage standard practice and cited study said 86 percent plans contraceptive coverage so women going contraceptive coverage now going cost free thats difference but idea  no but im saying your honor  unlike exemption small employees title vii exempts 17 million people fundamental protections race gender religious discrimination permanently transitional device time youre going get situation virtually nobody  situation grandfathered plan getting form contraceptive coverage anyway so i dont think undermines compelling interest one bit yes your honor thats  i think essence position substantial burden your honor i believe trying answer justice breyers question comes i believe comes lyng bowen recognize objective limit lung for example court said  doubt  government actions going devastating impact religious exercise  i would agree limited extent mr chief justice thats context government action occurs fact  relationship petitioners employees occasion government acting but two points critical i think go shouldnt consider cognizable burden and first one we act trying make alternative arrangement comes close ensuring employees may share petitioners religious beliefs get law entitles time ensuring employer legal obligation pay coverage provide coverage way i mean i think  practical features critical the employer cannot charged copay even insurance  insurance plan selfinsured either way cannot charged the insurance company thirdparty administrator got use separate segregated funds its got provide separate segregated notices in many instances provides separate insurance card employees part coverage so  respect independent arrangement third parties and  may  right i think one fair understanding case we think  let put way mr chief justice we would content court conclude respect substantial burden could assume substantial burden government satisfied burden rfra show compelling interest least restricted means achieving  no giving think  think discussion morning suggestive hard question important us and thats fighting giving we urging state comprehensive standard tells  i think  i think urging incremental approach recognizes principles articulated lyng bowen apply situation government acting  making arrangements third parties order fill regulatory gap  created government granting exemption religious entity yes we think would trigger rfra would substantial burden the difference situation youre actually premises and situation  trying get back i discussing mr chief justice  aetna  different entity petitioners blue cross different entity petitioners the government makes arrangements aetna blue cross make arrangements aetna blue cross insurance companies tpas provide contraceptive coverage third parties employees i dont think thats quite right justice alito i think theres confusion on petitioners side there two separate notices operate selfinsured plan the first notice employer provides government thats erisa plan document   legal effect document exempt employer obligation provide contraceptive coverage there second document different document government sends thirdparty administrator that document document legal effect creates obligation part thirdparty administrator provide coverage so case document comes us authorizing document thats exempting document so i  well i think  well its like intangible property the  plaintiffs really set rules thirdparty administrator becomes  purpose administering becomes plan administrator sole plan administrator portion plan but even one thought   create legally sufficient reason find substantial burden  thirdparty administrators true situation insurance companies its true church plans and seems question whether switching selfinsured thirdparty administrator situation insurance company situation would  whether would substantial burden yes and  government makes arrangement insurance company operates parallel plan and   isnt plan its parallel plan so i think theres significant difference  so gets question church exemption your honor and let try explain i think helpful understand came the church  initially hhs decided would create exemption churches and  backandforth regulatory proceedings petitioners participated created exemption churches and religious nonprofits came said well exemption ought extended us the government made judgment categorical matter wasnt willing extend exemption religious nonprofits requested instead would use accommodation thought best way could protect religious liberty  but  the reason drew line think  i think professor laycocks brief quite instructive point   line perfect im sure line isnt perfect theres going overlap entities maybe think  look closer one side line but line valid line and valid line largely reasons justice kennedy identified earlier category religious nonprofits may entities like one your honor identified appear close entities exemption but also going lots entities whose connection core religious mission much attenuated  and i  i think could your honor yes  i think  i think would  would appropriate accommodation i think compelling interest wed make narrowly tailored means argument but constrained weve tried especially careful houses worship and thats normal thing governments respect houses worship right and let try walk carefully i think important they identified three first grandfathered plans weve lengthy discussion i think ive tried show that  i dont think argue that exemption undermines governments compelling interest they claim exemption employers fewer 50 employees thats wrong in fact theres reason think virtually anybody  category employees small employers isnt getting contraceptive coverage part regular health care regular doctors and let explain there exemption contraceptive requirement group proof several petitioners group fewer 50 employees theyre asking  theyre asking  theyre  theyve raised rfra claim so  thats employers group provide coverage meet contraceptive coverage requirements employees get coverage regular doctor part regular health plan then also employer providing coverage group go exchange purchase policy exchange and policy provides contraceptive coverage part regular health plan regular doctor   eligible apply medicaid and medicaid gives contraceptive coverage part regular health plan regular doctor no because circumstance your honor option that employee buy individual policy exchange and individual policy contain contraceptive coverage regular doctor part regular health care the difference  somebody works grandfathered plan example category church  people already getting insurance and   obstacle youre forcing purchase second insurance policy and  really becomes financial penalty part compensation course health insurance theyre getting regular doctors so your honor i think answer theyre subsidizing way plan structured way accommodation structured  employers bear financial burden contraceptive coverage provided without charging employer funds segregated activity segregated so   quite carefully designed avoid existence subsidy respect and  talked  well sign second plan pay second plan your honor and thats precisely kind obstacle congress trying insure exist passed preventive services provision statute the whole idea ensure employees get health care get covered get care regular doctor part regular health care without added obstacles need go sign another plan find doctors going provide coverage plan all precisely kinds obstacles congress trying eliminate  i think lot your honor youve got go find  youve got go find separate  but  your honor put position  so  yes every policy sold exchanges  well except one but thats  you couldnt current law your honor but circumstance i think dont need get question whether obligation change current law even second contraceptiveonly policy available exchange would precisely kind barrier congress trying eliminate you two policies instead one policy that creates disincentives a lot women employees im certain reach conclusion well know ive got coverage  well  right no i think point your honor congress institute medicine  congress made judgment impose significant obstacle kinds requirements result significantly less use medicallynecessary services and  doesnt come your honor  its  your honor   governments interest advanced  least restrictive manner effective manner i think  and thats  thats correct your honor and thats i say make arrangement aetna blue cross making arrangement petitioners anything petitioners no i dont believe would  well  i dont think would but even it presents problem creating obstacle creates inertia problem undermines compelling interest compelling interest institute medicine hhs congress  whole point statutory provision supposed part   health care regular doctors well i dont  i dont think would address problem justice alito would  right i think thats exactly point  woman employee  i i try  the difference its filling paperwork youre woman employee go regular doctor say medical condition  i  puts risk pregnant i want contraceptive coverage i need contraception treat medical condition and way works  rfra exemption granted doctor say i cannot help the  i understand interest avoiding complicity consider sin we take seriously  i think rfra cuts situation quite decisively favor government interests compelling and  weve tried explain none alternatives petitioners proposed come anywhere close equally effective ensuring women get coverage and  obstacles  get told regular doctor i cant help i cant even counsel and  numerous petitioners filed declarations saying  insurance cover even counseling contraception so youve got go find another doctor and youve got   youve got find way pay doctor youve got find way pay contraceptive coverage its whole host serious obstacles its signing form and gets heart problem well would  well would happenstance somebodys got offer separate plan separate plan got  doctor goes regular doctor  plan theres reason think could get  all right i think weve tried   way ive tried explain your honor tried  i think court recognized hobby lobby goal exempt employer providing contraceptive coverage exempt provide separate means separate funds without involvement therefore hijacking what id like i could i want make one point  when youre hired one religious organizations get brochure package insurance coverage know everything and would contraceptive services listed it wont brochure cant brochure theres got separate communication insurance company employee telling employee youre getting separately us thats works now  so i think that raises problems identified no two policies instead one you got pay policy well i think  i think separate policy youre going to apply pay separately there whole separate regime i want make one point notice friend side raised idea notice us using plan notice provide that notice argument i think cant constitute substantial burden entirely derivative objection us setting thirdparty arrangement and i  i think mr clement told morning said government didnt take step providing coverage would happy provide information want form and i think  tells objection focus objection  arrangement provide separate coverage notice per se terms unobjectionable no dont think if i could closing id ask court weigh alternatives put case on one side youve got serious thoughtful effort respect petitioners religious beliefs creating system allows exempt requirement straightforward manner protects fundamental rights liberties dignity  employees many may share religious beliefs contraception on side scale youve got demand rights employees may share petitioners beliefs extinguished  extinguished time congress creates enacts different program require separate oneoff jerryrigged channel provide obtain contraceptive coverage impose precisely burdens congress said relevant statutory provision unacceptable preventive services what i would say your honor i think essentially eight court appeals said rfra requires sensible balance a sensible balance essential pluralistic society like people every faith earth live work side side government got administer rules fair everyone the accommodation  accommodation achieves balance petitioners position very far balance therefore court appeals affirmed thank you,1196.0,1699,39,and fair infer way open remarks concede substantial burden and question permissible accommodation whats least restrictive alternative do concede theres substantial burden well  question belief theyre complicit moral wrong well  seems thats substantial burden and  next question whether accommodation whether thats least restrictive thats  words compelling interest women obtain contraceptive services your compelling interest women obtain contraceptive services insurance plan thirdparty administrator hired petitioners hired little sisters in words seems cant say youre trying make sure everybody coverage you want make sure program set little sisters thats object the point form services provided object fact provided thats question in words petitioner used phrase hijacking seems thats accurate description government wants they want use mechanism little sisters petitioners set provide services want coverage seamless now maybe thats sufficiently compelling government interest form services provided interest whether women receive contraceptive services the petitioners object fact people work services provided they object provided mechanism set think know whether i anybody else thinks think that complicity sinful but youre saying dont worry religions youre complicit thats youre saying it seems analysis whether less restrictive alternatives  least restrictive alternative well let mention one suppose possible woman get contraceptive coverage grandfathered plan plan offered church plan offered religious nonprofit obtain contraceptiveonly policy free charge one exchanges why would least  less restrictive alternative what  type burden impose is  exchanges unworkable even help navigator  woman wants get free contraceptive coverage simply sign  one exchanges so shell two insurance cards instead one shell one employer shell one plan lot people one insurance card medical services one prescriptions   dental vision well talk  talk minute continue but would he would  would paid  contraceptive plan well dont think would willing sell subsidize 115 percent case provide services selfinsured plans what women  women grandfathered plans    grandfathered plans offer contraceptive coverage what but know long run dead but whats going happen  laughter   interim what reason congress require contraceptive coverage right away grandfathered plans it required coverage right away grandfathered plans 25yearolds could get coverage parents health insurance plan it would great administrative difficulty grandfathered plans put contraceptive coverage preventive care coverage right away 25yearolds and yet congress said really important things like covering 25yearold graduate student yes right away but things including talking today continue  provide coverage women long maintain grandfathered status well  come back  come back point making americans disabilities act certainly good point americans disabilities act it expensive retrofit facilities accommodate people disabilities but saying burden simply instituting coverage preventive care done coverage 25yearolds comparable making architectural changes general go back substantial burden question and i think justice breyer talking draw line when government act accommodate doesnt act accommodate there amici suggested line least helps draw clarity cases cases religious belief asking government change behavior respect  regulatory behavior respect others cant substantial burden live pluralistic society government function and hence youre military objector you cant tell government cant draft someone else you  cant spend money war we dont use promote war but want use others promote war youre entitled government does line make sense because religious groups i understand asking government use regulatory power third parties dont religious objection forcing burden women trying help third parties dont religious objection burdening things this  case government dealing third party based petitioners objection the objection government hijacking process insurance company thirdparty administrator hired set provide services i understand distinction yes want cant compel people take actions consistent religious beliefs but thats whats going it relationship insurer little sisters hired thirdparty administrator respect  entities used government provide services its third party thats compelled they want  want third parties take certain action they  third parties they insurance company petitioners hired its thirdparty administrator hired it seems balance pretty clear you want coverage contraceptive services provided i think  said seamlessly you want one insurance package thats done that compelling government interest and side question whether people sincere religious objections complicit hiring insurance company thirdparty administrator terms provided whether governments compelling interest outweighs sincere religious objections is fair understanding case is fairer one now arent giving substantial burden so thats  see thats exactly i found difficult exact and i  i read briefs neuborne said your brief said well look see  kind burden counts purposes rfra  first amendment where burden certain kind now kind and would say well kind arises fact program affects third parties big way okay well vietnamese church escapees los angeles poor meet basement house parking regulations stop congregation coming even want meet sunday think one we put easily context third parties hurt so cant practice religion so  one i think lot counter examples but maybe couple tax cases administrate widespread administrative rules government  leeway third parties widespread administrative you see so im  im trying get thinking people thought  others whats best way treat burden its hard find religious writing and people go society assume burdens going find totally obnoxious well i could  could address mr clements hypothetical  government would come  unoccupied room little sisters facility thats used anything they dont interfere they even pay rent and come establish title x clinic distributing contraceptives little sisters property and theres financial burden theres actually financial benefit is different situation well say brief admit brief least case selfinsured plan  notice  form notice becomes part plan this health insurance plan established erisa putting new objectionable element plan isnt correct but   plan admit putting something plan object religious grounds so difference mr clements hypothetical one involves something tangible physical property involves something thats intangible thats distinction well case insurance plan isnt insurance policy part plan isnt insurance policy way  employer provides benefits available plan what   governments interest requiring  requiring compliance catholic charities pittsburgh totally exempting catholic charities erie the difference course  properly phrased briefing accommodation way organizations comply mandate with respect catholic charities erie though dont comply accommodation way they exempt you draw line is  could apply requirements apply little sisters church entity no but understand argument its  weve said cases like o centro others lot exemptions undermines argument compelling interest well employees buy plans exchange work small employer employer doesnt offer health insurance arrangement frustrate governments compelling interest that underscores church plans religious organization plans effect subsidizing conduct deemed immoral if easy provide free cant get another plan so comes question paperwork if employee thats  thats good if religious organization thats okay theyre exchanges right theyre exchanges thats falsehood the exchanges require fullservice health insurance policies minimum coverages set forth comprehensive is true respect  were creating new program is true respect every policy sold exchanges what pediatric dentistry oh except pediatric dentistry so could separate health coverage product sold exchanges you fact already well way constitutional objections work might change current law laughter no no but i guess substantiates point i trying make question paperwork you said yes hassle go exchange although  know ive heard easy you get exchange get allow infrastructure petitioners said used vehicle  providing im saying comes one way another perspective im trying focus exactly issue its question whether want employee sign paper want little sisters sign paper in one case administrative burden youve said in case  violation basic principle faith thats necessary hijack plans is right is reason i get dont want women to ask coverage vast numbers women quite religious objections wont middle set people inertia bound and since inertia bound cant say poor people dont object religiously get contraceptives lowers cost health coverage later so government interest and therefore interest kind allowing system  system inertia bound take initiative have i got right all right do i part right hijacking federal regulation says infrastructure insurers contraceptiverelated plan belongs insurer person buys insurance am i correct couldnt executive deal problem whats available exchanges present time way policies available provide comprehensive coverage could executive say matter enforcement discretion going take action insurers offer contraceptiveonly policies fact going subsidize insurers 115 percent situation selfinsured plans why would  would valid exercise enforcement discretion well i understand youre saying would inadequate but would something could accordance understanding executive power could  could general verrilli explain difference employer filing form identifying insurer  say aetna blue cross  covers contraceptives many people insures difference notice woman doesnt coverage go affirmatively get someplace else is matter filing   form real difference  employer saying going cover contraceptives insurers name woman suddenly doesnt part package go  im sorry what  difference  asked difference all right thats interest one side equation what understand interest side equation which way  way rfra cut  analyzing balance why assume doctor women would go services plan would unwilling provide services plan  separate plan covers contraceptives why make assumption general  weve used  hijack analogy mentioned can explain dont see hijacking maybe i could follow answer the contraceptive services would provided pursuant plan mr francisco i think earlier said aetna offers separate policy giving insurance thought that would adequate  adequate accommodation no i meant  i meant he says generally aetna policy offers exchange women might want go exchange buy policy thats okay  thats  whats different from happens its basically thing isnt well two policies instead one contraceptives provided government regulation the seamlessness i think woman doesnt apply pay separately something else before sit general verrilli could i ask informational question particular situation little sisters their regular thirdparty administrator also provide  said provide coverage  even comply  form notice requirement and therefore say probably cannot  probably way erisa obtain contraceptive coverage employees unless find another thirdparty administrator could deal in situation would little sisters still subject fines failing comply well thats one way characterizing whats involved but could also  also said true case great array religious groups  catholics baptists

employees relocate close establishment relocates closes statute requires payment severance pay eligible employees i dont believe erisa regulations would apply erisa opinion would preempt application statute the statute call the maine statute call erisa yes erisa erisa cover severance pay plans expressly thats 31a courts held erisa covers severance benefits benefits benefits event unemployment there would example disclosure employees reporting would fiduciary standards would access federal courts would potential intrusion federal department labor various protective measures assure benefits received that correct i add your honor alternative grounds statute including severance pay erisa benefit in 31b theres severance pay specific reference severance benefits 32b adopted congress 1980 theres reference severance pay arrangements congress gave authority department labor secretary define severance pay arrangements welfare benefit plans instead might case treated pension plans the department labor regulations define severance benefits welfare plans therefore purposes erisa employee benefit plans the maine statute presents employer choice either private contract granting providing statutory word providing severance pay pay severance pay according statute the statute defines eligibility type benefit provided may obtain benefit and procedure one follow collect the eligibility basically three years employment the type benefit defined severance pay the amount one weeks pay year employment establishment case meant judgment covered periods date acquisition plant fort halifax the statute covers payments due provides procedure collecting benefits strangely provides suit state federal court the statute within words indicia plan the term plan defined erisa is referred plan fund program theres otherwise formal requirement must constitute plan on face therefore maine plan main law purports regulate defined erisa benefit plan severance pay and erisa section 514 preempts law extent law relates employee benefit plan now relationship contend apparent face statute well case your honor plan initiated statutory action state maine if plan solely established state maine maintained employer perhaps answer would but maintain yes would would required maintain plan the company would one would pay benefits the company would one would administer benefits to find people write checks forth perhaps defend claims raised so position yes employer required maintain plan thats correct yes but may may eligibility for example someone covered established someone employed three years breaks service forth so well say statute effect presents plan employer employer must thereby maintain plan that correct and case would plan apart statute would maintenance plan yes yes that correct we compelled force statute yes yes retirement plan production workers it retirement plan administrative clerical personnel and four employee welfare benefit plans i mentioned ill take opportunity say state maines brief say contrary plans besides retirement plans that correct these plans i referred joint appendix collective bargaining agreement pages 27 129 no your honor in case severance pay plan and it it require trust as long payment going made reasonably currently severance right your honor person subject plan go publication disclosure aspects time payment requirement funding requirement trust the erisa regulations require case severance pay category plan no does require no that correct course duties considered important erisa i suppose thats right if erisa doesnt apply the structure erisa supports congressional intent broad preemption state laws that phrase section 514 a relationship one either statutory plan private contract providing severance pay id like point aspects structure erisa bear congressional intent the definition term state section 310 ten parenthesis applies overall statute basically says state state but section 514 second definition state 514c2 your honor 514c2 page 66 jurisdictional statement appendix and definition state purposes preemption refined expanded clarified significant way the term state includes state purports regulate directly indirectly terms conditions employee benefit plans covered subchapter and ive indicated severance pay plan one plan state law page preceding subsection 1 also broadly defined indicate congress intent broadly preempt state laws defined include state action yes our position states may mandate award employee benefit plans particular levels types benefits thats decision left private parties thats part comprehensive scheme erisa statute the policy statement section 2 act refers scope impact increasingly interstate theres phrase effected national public interest another reference interstate character forth there policy statement conveys congress desire broad federal regulation and section 4b3 also another indication congressional intent page 63 joint appendix jurisdictional statement and shows congress comprehension would state mandated employee benefit plans three excluded coverage three otherwise congress contemplated state attempts mandate erisa benefit plans would within erisas coverage subject preemption now subsequent proposed amendments 4b3 none adopted there amendment 1983 followed courts decision courts affirmance agsalud decision left tact basically statute amended minor ways accommodate hawaiian statute part total and basic preemptive scope 514 left place following amendments those amendments show congress desire broad preemptive scope broad preemption state laws now court maine trying redefine statute means order avoid 514c2 i believe and i believe thats congressional intention leave type benefits level benefits parties choice basically congress left decision private parties now maine in part in part your honor in part well i would think would certainly difficult case intent statute expressed policy section 2 legislative history would hard conceive legislative history without expressed preemption provision but certainly hypothetically yes i dont believe decision left states that i believe accepted plan yes would severance pay plan 31a 31b well conceivably im sure thats right conceivably remedies afforded state statute could depart remedies federal statute for example maine certainly isnt giving anyone right secretary labor come advance cause participants maine what maine trying court tell court benefit could negotiated away completely they argue pages 17 18 maine statute really doesnt mandate benefits therefore 514c2 wouldnt come play statute doesnt purport regulate employee benefit plans well express wording 514c2 im sorry your honor page 65 excuse page 66 and c definitions subparagraph 2 i simply want indicate maine trying take different tack express words statute say the express words statute say either express contract providing severance pay observe statute thats applicable exception statute im referring an express contract providing severance pay here argue employer could express contract eliminating severance pay that finding maine supreme court and i refer joint appendix jurisdictional statement a12 words maine supreme court used regard in words statute either express contract face liability statute i briefly want turn 4b3 issue claim made 4b3 exempts maine severance pay law unemployment compensation law 4b3 exempts plans compliance three types laws workmans compensation unemployment compensation disability insurance laws severance pay expressly one three categories the attempt made fit severance pay within unemployment compensation law category otherwise maine would trying add fourth category statute we five responses that plain meaning term unemployment compensation law otherwise that congress use different terms statute different places entitles statute normal presumption different things meant different words used the departments regulations treat severance pay unemployment compensation fourthly maine treat severance pay unemployment compensation fifth maine laws real thrust unemployment our fundamental position term unemployment compensation law 1974 today accepted meaning that meaning pursuant social security act federal unemployment tax act 50 states laws it strange reading look interpretation term in statute ive already referred 31a 31b 32b congress using words severance pay severance pay arrangements another place statute using term benefits event unemployment still another place using term unemployment compensation law congress used terms presumably different meanings unemployment compensation means something quite different severance pay severance pay doesnt connote necessarily unemployment although termination employment the regulations department cite reply brief also equate severance pay unemployment compensation those regulations place i believe since 1975 theres 1980 amendment statute authorizing secretarys regulations those regulations force law entitled great weight now fourthly i said maine doesnt consider severance pay law unemployment compensation law it considers severance pay wages thats way severance pay thats way unemployment compensation law defines severance pay the severance pay statute unemployment compensation statute its somewhere else maine statutes heading severance pay subchapter starts wages thats right theres connection necessarily unemployment our fifth response real trust unemployment and point youve made your honor and also exceptions maine makes law shows concerned unemployment maybe concerned unemployment it exempts coverage severance pay statute victim fire victim bankruptcy these people injured yet protected as court stated recently guera determining whether state statute preempted sole task ascertain intent congress in erisa congress spoken express terms preemption unless court questions i reserve remaining time rebuttal your honor id briefly like clarify pension plan aspect versus welfare benefit plan aspect relate severance pay a severance pay plan statute page a61 jurisdictional statement appendix 10022a defines term pension benefit plan pension plan and part definition pension plan plan fund program results deferral income employees periods extending termination covered employment beyond typically severance pay payment made close termination employment no in severance pay case the statute passed 74 in 75 regulations adopted despite statute defined severance pay plans welfare benefit plans those statutes remain force in 1980 congress added 3 page a51 effect ratify department done treating severance pay plans welfare benefit plans and significance funding required one may pay general assets i refer court burlington industry cases cited briefs one second circuit one fourth circuit at 7721144 court refers structure statute says pension benefit plans welfare benefit plans must comply erisas reporting disclosure requirements fiduciary standards but pension plans subject stringent requirements vesting funding and thats accordance regulations department adopted treating severance pay plan pension plan welfare benefit plan although may circumstances even severance pay plan become pension plan payment strings long enough but basically funding apply no separate trust required payments may made burlington cases say payments may made general assets no separate entitles required your honor payments may made general assets thank you,384.0,447,26,you may proceed whenever youre ready mr yavis mr yavis employers compliance statute subject erisa do erisa regulations govern anything occurs order comply statute make believe doesnt would implementing statute employer comply erisa regs but erisa call if preempted erisa would compliance erisa regulations which means what would erisa require done respect plan i assume also true state statute private employer plan severance pay plan precisely statute requires private employer would also covered erisa xxx plan may i interrupt mr yavis second the definition erisa plan thats heretofore hereafter established maintained employer and contend statute passed well language fit statute do think language erisa covers plan established maintained state maine say take example say didnt plan youre employer didnt provide severance benefits anything would comply statute would compliance statute view fall within definition xxx not establish maintain and say act writing checks enough maintaining plan if know employees fire im sure but thats plan employer thats matter statutory compliance isnt you say words youre saying compliance statute equivalent maintaining plan well voluntarily theres problem this something voluntarily youve got hypothetical if said but course employer sort erisa plan effect tell takes maintain plan writing checks do fund erisa doesnt require either so even private employer set kind plan authority without statute compelling would client writing check does maine statute require publication it to kind publication notification erisa so unless plan covered erisa duties employer would eliminated but held i saying it held preemption duties wouldnt apply compliance maine statute all would regard severance pay statute requires held preemption you wouldnt give notice xxx so would make argument state said going say anything plan severance plan may i ask another question i may supposing maine amended statute exception requirement adopt a severance provision plan dont comply maine statute i guess pretty hard get union knows get statutory business suppose instead passed amendment said severance obligation shall apply employer erisa plan kind whole scope statutory operation employers plans would still preempted view do conclude preemption clause is conclude well would arguing expressed preemption clause wasnt even erisa well couldnt say case maine law preempted sense may require employer severance pay policy establishes subject erisa well i know i know establish severance pay plan statute purports require would subject erisa wouldnt because plan and erisa maine doesnt say wouldnt it wouldnt interfere it doesnt purport interfere erisa coverage plan adopted isnt right what 514c2 you published appendix 29 usc numbers why dont i suppose get severance pay even though go right another job dont thank mr yavis well hear mr warren but doesnt mean employee contributes no separate entity either mr warren referred xxx thank mr yavis the case submitted,1194.0,1677,35,mr chief justice may please court im going concentrate morning mr yavis erisa preemption argument there another claim preemption raised fort halifax thats claim preemption national labor relations act believe that claim adequately treated brief brief filed solicitor general ill content saying that agree national labor relations board case controlled courts decision metropolitan life issue now erisa issue agree mr yavis fundamental question turns intent congress case turns intent congress expressed erisa statute express provision erisa section 514 calls preemption we agree however state is requiring employer maintain employee benefit plan within meaning erisa mr yavis speaks broadness erisa preemption provision i would like look directly thats correct it would depend in case your honor i think difference maine law requires that would provide severance pay every circumstance employee termination maine law okay if provision contract said event plant closing would well would plan applied event plant closing and case think probably would covered erisa well thats quite right your honor i hope i i let clarify an employer establishes plan kind arrangement employees pay severance pay either event plants closing pay severance pay generally believe exempted maine law terms maine statute well employer creates plan exempt maine law im sure employer merely pays required maine law suggesting that creates erisa plan well really suggesting the statutory obligation created maine law bear resemblance kind employee benefit plans congress intending regulate erisa i think instance would probably covered well really think thats true context let explain its true context one reason what erisa really looking private arrangements employers employees employers create promises pay certain kind fringe benefits employees and would contend circumstances congress really focusing kinds problems developed respect kinds private arrangements what suggesting justice scalia wording statute interpreted light underlying policies erisa statute what youve got definition erisa plan plan fund provides certain kinds employee benefits either established maintained employer so suggesting dont something rises level erisa plan dont plan created employer maintained employer think youre statute wording statute i think ongoing benefit program payable employees time but would something it it requires make payment xxx well i dont think thats correct justice scalia i think mr yavis erisa coverage severance pay plan totally privately created would subject obligations terms conditions erisa would include requirement maintaining assets separate entity trust fund various disclosure obligations would entailed dont think thats correct thats correct well employer it would erisa plan could erisa plan instance maine law your honor i think well i guess i understand question suggesting employer independently creates erisa plan reaches contract employees pay severance pay would two effects first created separate erisa plan would subject erisa and second would terms would taken maine statute pursuant express contract exceptions thats correct if employer creates erisa plan response maine statute would erisa plan i dont think question whether employers payment benefits called statute constitutes erisa plan thats according maine statute we dont think that bare fact constitutes erisa plan well erisa plan i think argument could made point maine law relating erisa plan forcing well maine maine law interpreted relate erisa plan maine law would preempted i think that would create preemption problem your honor yes what im really trying thats correct your honor i think solicitor position taken solicitor general he would let explain i think thats wrong the preemption provision erisa source preemption argument case relates contains following language it preempts state laws insofar laws relate erisa covered plan and would suggest solicitor generals argument would essentially rewrite statute say preempts state laws relate employee benefits and thats correct would concede maine law would preempted but dont think thats correct we think congress focused word plan preemption provision focused word plan throughout erisa statute specific intent subject erisa plans federal regulation and i think thats might your honor it might i believe and i think look im sure statutory appendix i believe look i believe section 1101 29 usc talks various funding requirements assets held trust sense i think youre talking least trust assets i dont know whether employer would actually set aside monies plans i think would least create separate entity met definitions trust fiduciary requirements erisa to go back point i making response justice oconnors question i think really thats fundamental issue case turns question whether erisa preempts state laws relating employee benefits whether erisa preempts state laws relating employee benefit plans and i may id like point specific meaning plan i understand light congressional intent behind erisa and thats i mean plan defined erisa the word plan obviously something outside statutory context could made susceptible many meanings thats correct and im referring the plans i think congress focusing private arrangements created employer employee specifically worried abuses began seen context plans and abuses your honor no and maybe i clarify we suggesting state mandate that takes plan erisa the question whether state mandating erisa covered plan and really i think question thats court today and thats issue i think interested arguing thats really part company mr yavis if employer comply maine law would say employer subject erisa obligation i think secretarys position maine law requires creation erisa covered plan following premise would argue maine law preempted i dont think secretary that i think secretarys position and i think secretary and i think thats right justice oconnor im really suggesting secretarys position least reported solicitor general seems merely requiring benefit statement alone requirement alone sufficient create erisa covered plan thats thats correct well hawaii prepaid health care act act youre referring act really goes way beyond maine it doesnt require onetime payment event plant closing required employers establish comprehensive ongoing system providing health benefits and included within system imposed upon existing erisa plans it required employers alter amend existing erisa plans also contained certain reporting requirements went beyond conflicted erisa requires so seems issue hawaii act fairly easy case congress response court decision suggest certain features hawaiian law conflicting reporting provisions certain features would preempted and legislative history solicitor generals brief i think includes somewhat conflicting senate committee said felt preemption hawaii law inadvertent and statements made decision hawaii case exactly correct and would suggest statements necessarily reliable guide congress meant enacted original preemption provision erisa but event statements really dont provide guidance view fundamental differences law hawaii law and i think gets back issue law create erisa covered plan and seems theres really three reasons the first one i already mentioned create private arrangement employer employee subject kinds abuses kinds problems motivated i think your honor mr yavis stated term plan defined erisa i think gain enlightenment congress worrying look congressional findings declaration policy they indeed but im focusing well argument that reached severance plans based upon incorporation within definition reference certain benefits provided tafthartley act 186c and 186c refers severance benefits so thats severance benefits come although i we dont dispute erisa would govern plan provided severance benefits suggesting erisa necessarily cover entire topic severance benefits going back issue whether creates plan seems first got question private arrangements youve second got question i think presented unique form case whether one time statutory assessment constitutes kind plan contemplated erisa the ordinary erisa plan involves ongoing system paying benefits time its system necessity maintained xxx from point view employee might one shot severance pay well point view employer ordinary severance plan paid group employees depart employment relationship time in words theyre talking administering payment benefits im talking plant closing thats exactly maine law talking but reason agree erisa point view beneficiary justice oconnor death benefit probably one payment and point view employer however youre talking death benefits going paid group employees time youre talking one time payment event single contingency employees eligible its one time payment suggest theres language 9th circuit martori brothers case donovan v dillingham 11th circuit en banc decision suggests one time payment would subject necessarily erisa would constitute plan and lot courts tried grope constitutes plan but would submit falls outside plan one time payment the problem argument maine law creates erisa covered plan case one averted justice stevens one earlier questions law deemed create erisa covered plan would preempt state law even circumstance employer plan and circumstances really think congress could intended erisa preemption apply if right if law interpreted require erisa covered plan therefore preempted basis relates erisa covered plan creates law would preempted even case employer absolutely existing erisa plan time and suggest that goes way beyond congress intended preempt erisa preemption section it seems state requires something doesnt relate plan within meaning section 514 states proscription preempted in words i think court ruled shaw v delta airlines state law preempted insofar relates erisa covered plan so dont relationship erisa covered plan state law remains effect and suggesting employer plan would view stretch congressional intent beyond proper bounds suggest preemption what i really want focusing theres one principal id like get back issue preemption interpretation preemption provision seems interpreted light fundamental principle preemption favorite doctrine stated court i think early florida lime avocado case saying preemption found unless congress unmistakably intended displace state law that follows principles preemption believe court fully familiar it follows respect state law it follows respect states sovereign entitles respect states authority meet problems residents police power submit thats exactly maine done the problem plant closings unique maine particular problem maine number maine towns one major plant dominant employer so maine adopted statue state adopted meet problem its designed deal specific unemployment problem created plant closing submit maine entitled devise response particular problem absent clear expression congress maine law preempted subject and brings back i began i think think arrangement whatever want call created maine law statutory obligation bare statutory obligation pay severance benefits we believe that resembles kind employee benefit plan congress intending regulate enacted erisa i see time almost expired let say argument raised unemployment compensation law argument i would like direct courts attention arguments subject submitted aflcio amicus brief and specifically point make average traditional unemployment compensation law law resembles erisa covered plan therefore exemption erisa plans maintained solely comply unemployment compensation laws really doesnt make much sense applied traditional law,589.0,853,16,i understand position maine require type plan erisa would reach and employer established precisely kind plan maine law requires say would covered erisa say union employer negotiated said anytime somebody leaves gets weeks pay period well lets assume lets assume state union employer negotiates severance pay plan identical maine law requires well im saying plan requires precisely sets exactly maine law requires uhhuh erisa yes but say maine employer establishes plan response maine statute establishing plan subject erisa is right well thats said ago well may but employer established maine law well isnt plan recognizes obligation law make payment why you said private plan required severance payments upon removal plant would covered okay so youre telling us maine state i presume take employers coverage erisa simply mandating law erisa would cover employers done voluntarily thats great lot employers just get states enact law covers kind plan want adopt plan erisa oh well thats nice i dont care focusing i care law wrote now anything law would allow make kind distinction what word would enable distinction yank would otherwise covered severance plan erisa simply adopting state statute covers cant yank anything else erisa adopting state statute covers you would draw distinction i take follow justice scalias hypothetical maine statute said must create fund pay benefits certain periodic payments you would agree would plan created employer compliance statue therefore erisa plan so couldnt but point this statute doesnt require establish maintain plan as much plan severance plan ever a severance plan never requires funding i understand oh okay well would make big difference thats right it would funded well big difference i understand position employer would made promise pay benefits certain contingency arising and theres promise well say employer set plan response statute established wrote plan arranged funding would think wouldnt erisa plan it would reached erisa well i dont understand maine insistent saying employers response statute obedience statute create erisa covered plan because i dont know is necessarily inconsistent say maines requirement establish plan preempted plan sets erisa plan but heres employer doesnt plan doesnt want one law requires pay severance pay this maine statute requires pay give employees severance pay and thoroughly intends obey law now insist that isnt doesnt establish erisa plan well union says intend live maine statute of course i and thats thats said he pays severance pay accordance yes well important what erisa plan so maine could longer require maintain plan i take state could state like maine cant say employers within state want set erisa plans meet minimum standard then course governed erisa a state cant say well mr warren solicitor general united states also filed brief case suggesting courts opinion shaw v delta airlines indicates erisa preemption provisions also prohibit preempt state laws simply require employers provide certain specific benefits employees regardless question whether requires whether maines law requires set plan right he would go far beyond discussion whether maine law requires plan say court said shaw means state cant tell employers fringe benefits provide its important going back earlier ground whether plan adopted employer statute plan might adopt erisa that assert adopted erisa would funded is despite fact section 10022b says secretary may proscribe rules severance pay arrangements shall purposes chapter treated welfare plans rather pension plans does make difference do welfare plans funded you mean plan defined erisa and statutory context employee welfare benefit plan employee pension benefit plan dont im sure but im worried least im sure congress didnt intend enable one private plans kind adopted negotiations union yanked erisa simply required state law and severance plan fact different employer would erisa id reluctant find state effect yank erisa mandating it mandating state alone possibly take erisa right xxx even though pension plans even though severance plans subject erisa one subject erisa that employer erisa obligation regard do know position secretary takes or put put differently the position takes plan required established maine law erisa plan well im sure thats accurate apparently solicitor generals speaking secretary would say states cannot direct specific benefits provided type benefits covered erisa one things solicitor general relies upon fact erisa preemption section congress specifically carved hawaiis law provided specific kind health benefit and opted protect type state law that might indeed indicator congress trying specific states could intended preclude law like maines mr warren fairly complicated definitions plan think really lends kind generalizations congress getting wasnt getting rather kind parsing section the term employee welfare benefit plan term employee pension benefit plans defined why definition reach severance plans 186c so dont dispute erisa reach severance arrangements i see not severance plan erisa i mean every severance plan im familiar one shot severance plan thats normal one right well statute i see youre talking plant closing and one shot well death benefits one time benefit and yet surely wouldnt argue erisa doesnt reach say you lost beginning right why would stranger state law proscribes specifies lets say standard retirement plan a state enacts law requires specific retirement plan will come us say well cant possibly preempted case employer retirement plan anyway thank mr warren mr

appeal seek overturn lower court orders permanently irrevocably terminated relationships five children the parents order vacated time custody would still remain within state hopefully could meet representatives state establish visitation children eventual goal mother regaining custody the mother regaining custody yes well willing allow mother custody allow reasonable visitation rights maintain fatherly role children state resisted efforts since 1975 the father lives works atlanta mother lives stepson husband remains delaware yes no i think want regain children back family family the mother wants well i think mother family relationship children state intervened family willing create day day attachments thats correct they range ages six nine yes there ages oldest one nine two youngest ones twins six the nature proceeding termination parental rights proceeding tpr that proceeding unique delaware it seeks remove children custody parents rather seeks forever break parent child relationship it temporary removal child in words delaware statute sole purpose make parents children always strangers  its effect death penalty family this appeal raises three questions tpr outlined well tpr necessarily lead adoption as parent makes stranger it doesnt necessarily guarantee child theres going replacement as i said appeal raises three questions termination order the first question whether statutory standards used break family unconstitutionally vague the second standard whether state could proceed break family judicial proceeding using mere preponderance evidence standard the third standard whether state could break family without demonstrating conduct alleged parents caused actual substantial harm children briefly stated facts case john doe jane roe half brother sister beginning 1970s lived together five children the delaware state welfare agency division social services knew mr mrs does relationship since 1972 previously indicated that relationship would factor division would consider raising children however early 1975 workers division went local attorney general attorney advised he told meeting long children doe home would able prove does unfit parents would able get termination parental rights at meeting decided order remove children home parents would charged criminal charge incest once charged division would proceed obtain custody children file termination parental rights children that plan action division followed within week meeting attorney general brought criminal charge incest parents the parents incarcerated default 1000 bond 19 days given absence division social service effect given temporary custody children subsequently parents convicted criminal charge incest misdemeanor delaware permanent custody children given division whats important note incest conviction parents testified conviction misdemeanor told presiding judge presided trial underwent sterilization would substantial factor regaining children yes anxious get children back relying advice underwent sterilization within week undergoing sterilization division told going terminate parental rights the division yes i dont believe the record doesnt reflect knowledge wasnt the division filed termination parental rights proceeding the statute based provision former delaware provision allowed termination parents fitted continue exercise parental rights that short phrase sum extent statutory definition termination could go forward in original petition division alleged fitted conduct sufficient trigger statute half brother half sister relationship its conduct division known almost three years fact told past wasnt going used well contend also best interest vague fitted language the triggering criteria get best interest effect fitted standard unless go forward fitted i dont think best interest matter state law comes play and superior court supreme court emphatically stated half brother half sister relationship disqualifying triggering criterion fitted its precondition if effect precondition met would go best interest i think opinion points exactly limited scope delaware supreme court read term best interest i think phrase comparative phrase requires looking elements concerning child how trial court supreme court construed merely looking harm children occurred rather sort conduct parents abstract i dont think order proper either parent yes i think theres conduct behalf either parent particularly mother even fathers conduct theres conduct part shown conduct caused harm children well i think best interests well i think order terminating parental rights effect giving children strangers vacated effect interests state courts may adjudicate interests decide conflict my discussions parents point dont seem conflict she willing custody willing she willing allow visitation given distance away shes willing allow thats discussions weve when separate the record reflect she married july 1977 they separated prior final opinion delaware supreme court they knew separated in delaware supreme court opinion appendix you mean parties separation i speculate that information given delaware supreme court no but given delaware supreme court didnt think remand new facts appropriate no believe even though facts existed 75 there specific request delaware supreme court remand factual situations changed the parents arent seeking order would overturned get children back given passage time next day they want regain contact children work towards eventually reintegrated home thats correct starting point yes i believe it well not direct appeal until rule final no those facts told delaware supreme court as i indicated originally trial court agreed division half brother half sister relationship parents wasnt sufficient fitted conduct an appeal taken delaware supreme court the delaware supreme court reach legal issues remanded back trial court separate findings made second statutory standard best interests a five day trial held trial court i indicated although term best interest seems mandate sort comparative analysis trial court state resisted efforts parents show type care children receiving states custody what information leak oldest child period states custody shuffled back forth nine different foster care placements at end trial court entered final judgment indicating found best interests children terminate parental rights based several factors one frequent moves parents mr doe frequently changed jobs the second half brother half sister relationship parents and third prior conviction mr doe suffered misdemeanor offensive touching that last factor hotly contested issue it arose 1973 division charged mr doe sexually assaulting one daughters after trial matter acquitted sexual offense he suffer offensive touching conviction placed probation he described conduct formed basis conviction it playfully placing tongue 212yearold daughters nose mouth again case returned delaware supreme court they rejected parents vagueness challenge statutory standards upheld trial courts use preponderance evidence found specifically half brother half sister relationship triggering criterion fitted criterion we think interest state assert termination parental rights thats compelling prevention actual substantial imminent harm children any less intrusion without proving permissible pardon justice marshall physical harm surely mental harm characterized overt symptoms merely speculation symptoms aggressiveness withdrawal forth well i think trial courts decide types issues every day difficult show types actual harm i think appropriate way state legislatures go field effect spell criteria harm i think thats required individual social workers judges dont effect define within vague statutes ideas good parenting bad parenting its legislative choice legislature set criteria i think thats legislature look harm children rather trying detail right wrong parent if theres harm children theyre effect looking welfare children if legislature defined welfare a construction would limit welfare harm i think would constitutional if harm effect actual harm imminent threat actual harm whether psychological physical the problem dealing case case basis without criteria legislature denominated harmful thats easy way judges effect impose values well case today i think state imposing unless returning children parents would cause actual harm when state trying take children parents give someone well i think return natural family state effect cant show going cause harm well i think time state seeks intrude family effect state surely show possibility harm custody stage much termination state effect permanent well theres finding i think thats responsibility state court well i think criteria trial court lists frequent moves family half brother half sister relationship would support finding sufficient harm effect permanently break family the moving family father changed jobs something occurs millions american families i believe theres scintilla evidence record concerning half brother half sister relationship showed that caused harm children already existence the experts brought forth state generally never seen parents children even situation disclaimed reliance upon half brother half sister relationship causing harm children they half brother half sister five children convicted crime yes sir well thats decision delaware legislature made thats problem fitted conduct theres explicit grounds delaware says conviction misdemeanor means forfeiture children my personal opinion in absence showing types harm ive outlined im sure state reason take children parents absent showing conviction conduct caused conviction harmed child reason state intervene i think absence harm i think well i think response would twofold initially effect stating standards conduct drive automobile run commercial business may accepted standards outside law lot different state tries interfere family something court recognized fundamental interest parents children secondly i would point asking absolute certainty delaware statute used parents without statutory definition without narrow construction surely vague it doesnt give guidance anyone either fitted standard best interest standard well i think court effect required states effect take legislate make law types factors jury would consider thats basically weve pointed examples appendix brief amici point that would proper way courts go procedure try detail outline every type conduct parent cannot effect delineate types harm sufficient allow judges decide whether effect parental rights forever forfeit thats correct well i think thats difficult issue and decided case legislature makes choice the delaware legislature made choice to say conviction misdemeanor incest triggering criterion as i responded mr justice marshall feeling absence final determination that conduct caused harm children no as personal belief whether would no surely would eliminate vagueness problem substantive due process problem ill briefly point third issue presented court proper standards proof recently addington v texas court outlined factors constitution compels states require judicial proceeding something beyond mere preponderance evidence apply addington criteria loss liberty stigmatization possibility decisions based unauthorized conduct those factors clearly present tpr there additional criterion i pointed tpr wasnt present addington in addington original commitment could effect changed erroneous original commitment could changed in tpr original erroneous termination forever it cannot changed and despite states protest i dont think higher standard proof asked causes problems as point brief numerous states adopted clear convincing evidence congress spoken issue required showing harm required showing harm beyond reasonable doubt it analogizing tpr effect greater punishment criminal conviction in sum unless lower courts reversed state delaware taken children parents ill defined standard proving case mere preponderance evidence without demonstration children harmed parents conduct in sterilization state taken children parents ever well point concerning remand question i think remand question questions weve posed concerning vagueness issues regardless change statutory language new section i think two constitutional issues raised properly court would decided regardless remand well whole point i gather chief justice hughes statement patterson case followed great many others including bell maryland quoted court ought determine constitutional questions perhaps disappear reconsideration new law well i think standard proof argument going disappear remand may entail another evidentiary hearing allow go forward contend impermissible standard proof well may may win well i think lower courts need instructions you may win may never decide question and i would point substantive due process i think court i think delaware court case cases indicated going require harm think thats constitutional requirement mr myers view law remand new hearing would issue hearing whether parents presently unfit whether unfit 1976 i think fairness parents would whether presently meet whatever statutory requirements state courts would apply and present law under present law the facts quite different five years ago i would respectfully beg im sure whether delaware would apply present law i know i understand would like decision yes thank you,617.0,740,63,we hear arguments first morning doe vs delaware no 795932 mr myers may proceed whenever ready do want children back mr myers say with essential goal in custody so doesnt want back well i correct neither mother father seen children several years no seen children several years they separated she married but want really access children want know they speak they they family unit anymore there five children and wants five and old children six nine five i see when ends relationship parents i gather effect adoption doesnt no terms termination relationship parent child doesnt effect adoption and its totally irrelevant did judge pay sterilization procedures has ever reimbursed well mr myers reading opinion delaware supreme court page 199 atlantic 2d court says statute must also finding termination parental rights best interest child  indicating parental unfitness sufficient well wouldnt sufficient i read delaware supreme court opinion mr myers agree view whether issues mother father now reason i ask theres evidence offensive touching father alcoholism least time past father one thing another but parents different places presumably would make difference parent contact child do concede order proper one parent proper i understand issue i understand harm argument best interests child argument perhaps theyre separated theres least arguable basis drawing distinction two in fact interests entirely parallel are i know represent seems one representing mother separately perhaps mother could make arguments father cant make well change circumstance take place proceedings yes separate well case went delaware courts did delaware supreme court know facts well suppose thing would happened think termination parental rights would occurred facts exist existed time petition terminate parental rights yes and marriage mother it never given trial court though did ask well i know thats im asking you never well i would supposed might easier time trial court facts wouldnt just parental termination youre asking youre objecting right change custody no youre interested termination parental rights overturned but youve never asked anybody judgment isnt final yet no isnt if isnt final but youve never asked delaware court reconsider light new facts mr myers part position state may ever terminate parental rights physical mental harm physical mental harm i wanted know i get degree psychiatry decide case then think also criteria termination spelled detail i take well appropriate isnt really i mind dealing constitutional question you think states required list factors well issue welfare children interests children good parenting bad parenting so dont really dont really say welfare children necessarily insufficient standard if state happened construe standard requiring showing injury children wouldnt objection no im saying legislature i said state court construed way or specific case applying welfare children standard matter fact found harm children i dont know youd you wouldnt require standard termination custody would it sense i take would say state custody children validly could never adoption unless standard satisfied so unless state could prove state would always retain custody and would required put children kind permanent family so saying custody rests standard in taking record whole telling us record would support conclusion finding conclusion emotional harm children ive asked hypothetical question would support are saying would support finding the problem i admit theyre living incest and dont think child brought home two criminals continuing practice criminality good home that wasnt question my question think yes well suppose state murder misdemeanor would home husband mother father convicted murderers making murder pastime decent home opinion so perfectly right live home murderers whats position im trying get position well havent courts run problems attempted lay definite criteria justice holmes earlier days railroads said declare negligent matter law come railway crossing fail obey stop look listen  sign mcgautha opinion justice harlan referred royal commission report saying proved impossible virtually define standards made one subject capital punishment theres necessarily element vagueness negligence embraces many situations tort field i dont think court today says vague require negligence jury deliberates negligent well capital punishment mcgautha case well delaware legislature say mother father living incestuous relationship unfitted parents that alone ground termination parental rights would certainly eliminate vagueness problem but i understand answers questions propounded colleagues would eliminate either two problems case is correct and understanding correct but court the court construed statute mean right correct so words would eliminate two challenges legislation is correct is understanding correct thats question well personal belief your belief advocate court it would it would eliminate vagueness problem clearly right mrs small thank counsel the case submitted,1745.0,1867,32,mr chief justice may please court this case involves abstruse academic abstract principles constitutional law justice questions demonstrated cases come court neither abstruse abstract academic this case involves five children biologic parents right parents separated mother remarried raising child present husband regain parental rights order final except sense finally final court regain right form contact children perhaps custody future time planning according counsel ms roe testified tpr hearing wanted keep good home children keep clothed fed good that concept parenting duties the testimony record transcript five day trial remand delaware superior court conducted termination hearing record court indicates visitation time removal custody grounds children termination hearing ms roe particularly interested children unable relate the social worker participated visitations testified one point young child baby time charles brought cried the mother unable comfort unable bring emotional succor foster mother building time visitation brought calm child visitation could continue short time the mother made emotional responses children left my recollection infant justice stevens he would but foster mother able calm quickly i doubt often reaction happened specific visitation session and testimony beyond particular visitation session fact children voluntary custody division eldest two amy bill ms roe indicated particular interest children thats question i ask without good answer justice stevens the children case seen parents since they made efforts division counsel and denied they also they made attempt 1977 december 1977 year four months first termination hearing obtain stay termination hearing purposes obtaining visitation rights that application made trial court delaware procedure requires it denied application renewed delaware supreme court and full year eight months last children removed custody much less parental control first time made application court stay order could yes they continued thats correct and opportunity make application delaware supreme court no justice stevens fact time oral argument delaware supreme court full opinion delaware supreme court appears appendix jurisdictional statement discloses delaware supreme court aware fact mr doe living georgia i think undoubtedly mr does parental rights terminated ms roes parental rights terminated also and evidence respect parents put forward termination trial and basis thats correct however application made delaware supreme court although upon question undoubtedly acted requested act although question chief justice delaware supreme court elicited information present condition present condition 1978 parents children so fact clearly ms roe married another man raising child no justice white the first point i make statute repealed talking nine children would affected decision court five children four children able v delaware case appeal if appeal pending appeals filed day new statute enacted i understand question delaware supreme court would review case statute existing time termination parental rights with with attack made appeal i cant see court could review light new statute except say you anticipated exception except say could take cognizance record make determination record likely remand trial court but time termination repealed statute one governed i give practical answer question justice white that then i shall attempt give legal answer a remand case application present delaware statute delaware courts would less tacit recognition former statute vague likely as part comprehensive statutory no language statute different although generic terms unfitness best interests still required in fact new statute remarkably similar language statutes appellants point court appendices brief models kind flexibility required that leads practical answer several years permanent placement children the state thinks that would travesty delawares termination parental rights statute tpr statute counsel suggests unique we know state doesnt similar statutory provision in fact appellants brief page 32 notes 52 53 making standard proof argument appellants list number states use clear convincing evidence standard proof termination parental rights standards parental rights acts so i would assume concede tpr statutes in fact delaware forefront statutes require best interest fitness parents considered cline case 1967 standards court alluded offer kilwarren counsel brief recitation facts seems pass years intervening first contact doe roe division social services time termination parental rights action filed in three years continued contact agency family the children first placed voluntarily mr doe came agency said able time provide support family after helping obtain employment helping family find nice home younger two children time bill replaced home the division observed family life satisfied point 1973 family coping providing stability one child replaced elder child amy shortly thereafter the reaction mr doe quit job promptly went found another fired the family moved middle night night worker make regular visit leaving forwarding address from time relationships division family continued increase the divisions policy maintain family unit whenever possible becomes impossible reason incapability failure parents able provide nurturing stable environment child right family integrity division believes permanent placement alternative close family situation new adoptive family preferable one and fact record discloses division made determination children put adoptive care could received new family albeit biologic one new family tpr filed the record disclose they four families the twins placement youngsters the record disclose justice marshall a reference miss kinkaids testimony trial termination trial information comes miss kinkaid psychologist employed division test observe children testified testimony found page 241 record thought information saw provided either division childrens bureau amy nine placements on cross examination asked nine placements foster placements and said no i think nine  well  im paraphrasing id go back check im sure the next piece evidence put records state hospital child psychiatric center amy tested several years and point showing three foster placements her placement worker testified yes and yes agency there affirmative showing contradict rather questionable recollection miss kinkaids part it could done i represent court child total six placements including family entire life till today but thats record the evidence though record alluded to support nine placements support nine placements there nothing record knowledge im getting back justice white talking i dont know weve got the one side neither i justice marshall one side argues lady dying get children back record shows married another man nobody vouches now conclusion i draw i think draw conclusion justice marshall i think look back time termination proceeding ms roes interest regaining custody children i think belied facts case for example sexual misconduct charge filed mr doe custody three children state actual physical custody well legal custody roe disappeared period four months charge filed leaving state making attempts contact children point the record disclose history instability family relates mr doe ms roe lack part strong emotional attachment children the youngest home since age six months well deny wants children the thing record i point positive assertions testimony i quoted well isnt suit one example positive assertion she seeks i understand affidavit forma pauperis contact i understand counsels argument morning would seek reunite family i understand quotation local newspaper yesterday didnt know wanted children this perplexing point division well clearly court well evidence want havent given there direct evidence abandoned children separate basis termination her parental rights terminated basis individual unfitness without regard mr doe except one reasons lived incestuous relationship well question fit unfit true wants children i counsels representation rely upon well anything contrary the records closed case since december 1976 justice marshall do anything contrary the answer right so well take point im saying important doe roe longer living together thats correct and obviously they couldnt want children parents children co homemakers children theyre co homemakers anymore even no thats counsel admitted opening statement he also said wanted he said positively wanted children what becomes john doe but question say he say your honor well thank now anything contradict fact no your honor conducted discovery case court didnt think appropriate ms small id interested discussion constitutional issues i thought took case consider there believe court one properly raised constitutional issue thats attack former delaware statute vagueness the standard rationale vagueness standard state enacting legislation affects individuals put reasonable man notice conduct prohibited may act accordingly applying standards courts may determine without discriminatory standardless application whether statute force we think former delaware statute survives attack void vague it question whats preferable draftsmanship the question whether meets threshold requirements either face assuming face narrowing interpretations delaware courts the statute says parental rights may terminated one considered fitted exercise parental duties that seems to delaware courts standard comprehensible ordinary person care feeding clothing providing emotional needs need stay rain plaintiffs submit slide rule calculations determining whats statute would survive void vagueness attack amici agree case child custody flexibility determining statutes as i say i think delaware supreme court referring dictionary definition suggested statute face sufficient give standards even delaware courts years interpreted statute reasonable person ought know conduct proscribed now mrs small said thought one constitutional issue properly counsel appellants says three constitutional issues properly why think others properly the question ie burden proof substantive due process standard calls state need establish harm children terminate parents relationship as latter justice stewart raised delaware supreme court how second one motion reargument as former argument delaware supreme court standard proof beyond reasonable doubt appellants correctly point reply brief make reference addington case reply brief delaware supreme court motion reargument but discuss context reference made with respect burden proof issue addington cited reply brief delaware supreme court directly positive statement standard proof case must beyond reasonable doubt well event concede the case cited the argument clearly made standard proof preponderance evidence constitutionally impermissible insufficient that correct the standard urged standard urged court mrs small may i ask this reference delawares new statute ive looked it certainly seems standard new statute best interests children surely quite different standard old statute fitted and question bell maryland vacated state court appeals maryland judgment remanded reconsideration light new law state maryland relied patterson alabama 294 united states 600 mr chief justice hughes stated following question isnt statement applicable case chief justice hughes said we frequently held exercise appellate jurisdiction power correct error judgment review make disposition case justice requires  and determining justice require court bound consider change either fact law supervened since judgment entered  we may recognize change may affect result setting aside judgment remanding case state court may free act  we said review proper sense term decision state court upon non federal question deal appropriately matter arising since judgment bearing upon right disposition case  well answer suggests two things justice brennan first change statute enacted summer add best interests standard that standard statute court decisions since 1967 the change phraseology respecting fitted fitted to answer i think thrust real question i suggest new statute presently constitutional attack reasons delaware state courts likely yes neither i gather really know delaware state courts would sent back reconsideration light statute in light new statute how would interpret would deal constitutional challenge dont know no know although but surely ought decide constitutional questions tendered delaware courts would reconsideration apply new statute well i think fair say even appellants would agree new statute although wont concede constitutionally acceptable better old statute delaware supreme court find old statute vague determination parental rights statute would likely affirm precedent your practical called practical answer brother white earlier however would still applicable delay would delay potential adoption children thats correct because delaware termination parental rights prerequisite adoption of course it anywhere in states a child cant two mothers two fathers thats correct i suppose would rather remand though declaration unconstitutionality wouldnt certainly justice white,232.0,286,30,how old child there sorts reasons child may continue cry i suspect something like happens every parent though doesnt mrs small mrs small suppose theyre still litigating case but true make efforts denied access children and denied well supposed other fight lawsuit had made informal requests agency made denied had regularly denied maybe got little discouraged and tried court denied court well mrs small ever request reconsider case light current facts do think represents judgment delaware supreme court changed circumstances wouldnt make difference yes problems existed time proceeding trial court didnt exist anymore they werent living together incestuously lady married now so really cant say delaware supreme court acted request remand proceedings light changed circumstances in delaware statute govern removing children custody parents well case pending delaware supreme court suppose filed suppose filed delaware supreme court day new statute passed under law would delaware court review case yes it wouldnt review light new statute thats little odd isnt well could remand see trial court reconsideration light new statute wouldnt thing but rule normally civil cases adjudge case light current law current statute why shouldnt remand reconsideration see new statute makes difference delaware courts well im really wanting legal answer which probably thing go ahead why delaware replaced statute well nevertheless replaced statute it isnt standard well shouldnt case thats final shouldnt parents case judged light current state standards and pass constitutionality statute thats replaced ms small record tell us

concluded involves housing rights disadvantaged citizens society however case certiorari supreme court north carolina involves issue state action it conceded respondent housing authority city durham agency state operating state statutes operating lowincome public housing project contract united states the question presented also one directly involving racial discrimination claim rather general one whether public housing authority may terminate tenants housing benefits entirely arbritrarily without giving reason without accountable your honors question relates reply brief regulation adopted february 7th briefs filed department housing urban development in first part reply brief set forth argument think would support decision court reversing decision setting aside eviction nonconstitutional ground however urge court consider constitutional questions exercise discretion decide several important reasons we think first vital important  court may claim rights public housing tenants  protected constitution  public housing tenants rights court protect public housing authority must respect its  accident i think 30 years gone since federal housing program first adopted first case come court tenants position assert rights public housing authority and thats people dont money litigate cases rarely opportunity so important constitutional rights going protected theyre going to protected administrative agencies way administrative agencies stimulated act judicial decision february 7th regulation represents it court granted certiorari longstanding policy reversed  if correct your honor agree if important new regulation construed clarify one two ambiguities right hearing i intended perhaps would worthwhile time mr justice harlan since raised issue i discuss new regulation  detail the  your honor argue  part language regulation general precedence courts regulation applied case pending case final since record certiorari yes state we  believe  trial court would bound supremacy clause recognize defense regulation one dated february 7 1967 reply brief regulation states “its essential tenant given notice vacate without told  told local authority reasons eviction that  local court would honor say requirement  local public housing authority coming court violation rule couldnt prevail” this case arose we think  well  getting mr justice douglas area  certainly regulation precise specific for example regulation doesnt use word hearing it says uses term “private conference” suggests tenants given opportunity make reply explanation may wish now means i would call hearing rudimentary due process proceeding tenant would right know authority placed would sort opportunity probe  case find facts relied  challenge version facts contested assuming contested would  would right impartial decision know end hearing process ground rely decision making and i think circular construed court require then court might able avoid constitutional question however i think i began entire discussion saying part mr justice harlans first inquiry think important court circumstances decide  constitutional issue due process issue might serve policies normally served avoiding constitutional questions i  i think decision made authority  giving  giving evidence  tenant inaudible yeah  situation  tenant claims one version incident event project manager claims another version  perhaps director authority superior authority would sort hearing officer well i  i dont  yes correct  i dont insist anymore formality  appropriate considering circumstances terms rules evidence thats i  i wouldnt  i wouldnt insist example claimant claimant  yeah  yeah  i agree that  that kind nonadversary conference works  would there  variety questions first  right represented would seem fundamental tenant would right bring lawyer personal representative lawyer bring family friends  head tenant organization poverty program worker social worker come help state case no entire  throughout proceedings authority stood right  no no suggestion  reason it  authority stands proposition absolute it doesnt say  evicting she alleged  believes evicted activities organizing tenants organization yes mr justice stewart i  i never really got  got opportunity  state case i   court find her issue  basis stipulations stipulated testimony  record page 7 it stipulated executive director housing authority would call testify would said “whatever reason may giving notice joyce c thorpe termination lease” reason elected president inaudible i paraphrasing believe like president tenant group trying organize tenants this  that  correct mr justice douglas your question points new regulation doesnt say housing authority reasons acting must reasonable must arbitrary it deals  procedural side now i want get far away terms its part mr justice fortas question type hearing procedure thought fundamental id  ive answered i believe respect right bring along personal representative i think right sort opportunity put 4evidence  i mentioned word tenants side version facts direct supporting witness  essential an opportunity know facts housing authority relying  keep  put someone project if claim   tenant engaged misconduct shes really required make known facts  purport act give tenant opportunity disprove challenge well violation eye witness cant give good reason cant evict our  i  i think it seems bedrock position case  concept expressed lines judge edgerton  rudder case theyre  theyre quoted brief top page 16  language this“the government landlord still government it must act arbitrarily unlike private landlords subject requirements due process law arbitrary action due process” it seems  thats supreme court inaudible let  let address it  seems thats   sufficient answer so say lowincome tenant right vis–à–vis governmental housing agency inaudible contract citizen must right treated fairly  governmental agency due process clause so i think inquiry  lease says doesnt decide constitutional question but  one form might thought raising issue waiver whether  whether lease waive constitutional right  fair treatment yes you honor first amendment fifth amendment id say it seems i  i cant say enough emphasize  potential kind arbitrary power suppressing dissent there 23 million americans live public housing projects half negroes 31 elderly people these  citizens

state agency approved congress reasonable we  dont question whether rule example cant   cant dogs  project violates due process we dont kind question yes well let  let suggest  subject mr justice black i think kind area perhaps normal presumptions validity legislative action  normal strength doctrine may run full course area like  like area speech i think like area referred footnote four carolene products case  previous people way expression unless courts protect political expression political structure well i  i recognize many decisions court accord  notion particularly  economic regulation field court 30 years ago i suppose shifted course indicated would interfere  legislative experimentation economic regulation what  im suggesting case area governmental regulation  intimacies privacies peoples lives  well area  no i  i dont suggest itd judicial i suggest limits well mr justice black let step back moment  suggest questions discussing  i think things thought im involved  case involving procedural rights rights  know government acting  right fair  fair chance meet  governments case going cut subsidy so case today involves procedural claim court  i  i

would get benefit regulation wouldnt so remanded on ground would happen would go back giving notice required new regulation is became hearing excuse mr nabrit mean  think ought impartial hearing officer one situations well suggesting fullfledged hearing administrative sort is right i know wouldnt insist inappropriate procedures were trying find conception inappropriate decision but transcript suppose want represented counsel right counsel and suppose cant afford counsel counsel appointed as problem right i take dont think conference technique would adequate even opportunity given tenant present views i  i suggesting i asking view i dont want inaudible why  evicted does anybody know a nonpayment rent  so finding court  evicted well   new regulation im reading would giver hearing would find state “the reason evict organized tenants” exactly reason “and order evicted again” is  nothing prevent regulation inaudible youve interrupted great deal  basis tell  premises agreement explicitly gave either  either party right terminate 15 days notice without  without cost thats agreement says thats contract says signed thats makes case inaudible what youre saying government cant  proprietor housing agency discharge tenant  way votes way speaks ideology economics taste literature things kind youre talking first amendment were recess mr nabrit may continue argument a part  part contract i talking i suppose part last full paragraph page 12 record is  talking the one i referring ive said last full paragraph page 12 record by tenant term im sure case mr nabrit less insofar im concerned i understand  case stands allegation improper motive allegation evicted head housing authority tenants organization found courts right and makes  allegation improper motive so really naked question whether authority give notice failure renew month month tenancy there monthtomonth tenancy and doesnt allege improper motive thats  thats decided when stipulation entered thing stipulation says subject executive director would call say  lease terminated elected president theres nothing stipulation effect people called would testify that reason is correct but  nothing stipulation would indicate theres evidence support charge  tenancy terminated reason bad reason allegedly bad reason mr nabrit assuming agree constitutional issue  scope judgment do think congress would right provide building houses apartment houses aid provide provide parties would right contract among terms voice overlap what i wondering challenging power congress provide management would right make contract  tenants well import  import  well arbitrarily word i dont know exactly meaning i know given blanket authority determine conduct arbitrary pass legislation meaning thats i calling i would call usurping functions congress what im wondering youre saying  remember decided basis socalled arbitrar past although constitutional level congress cant change establishing policy choosing policy adopt what im wondering youre claiming congress doesnt power permit apartment rented tenants terms agreed parties thats reasonable legislative  legislation always adopted according members congress basis fact believe reasonable well question policy determined court determine basis judgment reasonable arbitrariness inaudible it gets us field making policies legislative supposed  cant change it gets field law unchangeable legislative body instead letting legislative body determine policies and i understand youre asking thats governmental and making judicial you trying make judicial you suggesting legislative body acts supervisor inaudible government department it contributing towards that seems thats asking thats im asking under  procedural rights bill rights like trial jury step say thing going hold unconstitutional think unfair arbitrary thats problem jury trial which bill rights require thats little bit controversy isnt it comes squarely within ive usually considered case controversy make practically lawsuit thats i think well thing bothers bring words constitution say whenever court looks contracts government makes things different policy required order make fast nonarbitrary according courts judgment it decides doesnt wait legislative body you mean man working government bureaucrat why wouldnt include courts well least say dont act congress protect person thrown state hospital race inaudible religion right that well lot laws passed field congress i think better passing court thats  i wanted ask though mr edwards,1723.0,2424,23,mr chief justice court please in answer something mr justice douglas asked certainly first amendment casewhatever this issue decided contention first amendment rights issue decided trial court the juror waived parties agreed judge decide facts the petitioner stage game prevented introducing evidence reason could think eviction she available discovery procedure  procedures state courts find want stage reasons advantage he ask use  confine allegation evicted first amendment right assemble and time said didnt know reason wouldnt tell reason somewhat contradictory true facts found significant thing precluded trial court asserting constitutional right might felt violated term and case i think presents question suggested government level whether local state national inject funds money public money housing program without time required constitution abandon ordinary normal rules governing landlord tenant applicable throughout land in words normal procedures leasing renting least unusual outlandish  unconstitutional government used physical powers promote housing project sort housing program nation id like i think that essence case lease unusual lease 30day lease automatically renewable unless 15day notice given terminate is inviolate instrument is  may i  may i get straight yes sir to see exception number one page 25 challenges trial courts findings evicted first amendment right that right it says she  takes court supreme court supreme court unless i missed something doesnt reset saying reason good reason context i  i think thats quite accurate sir  supreme court  issue pressed the finding fact trial court  it exception number one that exception trial courts finding fact trial courts finding fact but got supreme court issue argued evidence trial fact could found finding fact sustained evidence competent evidence court therefore  abstained well im referring opinion page 28 immaterial may reason lessors unwillingness continue relationship landlord tenant yes that  language somewhat bothersome  per curiam decision north carolina supreme court however i think that language would raise constitutional issue since read i take background finding fact particular constitutional issue asserted petitioner fact that immaterial reasons might you distinction i think  but decision  thats revising record supplementing cant tell record say waived that   her exception number one waived you cant accept true except fact normal rules  procedure effect finding fact trial court based competent evidence normal that finding fact shall overturned appellate court issues lower rate and trier fact evidence upon could found fact and issue goes forward  dont raise  issue certainly trial court error making finding fact evidence way stipulation  would permit justify finding fact trial court and make point supreme court north carolina language might  opinion might construed saying trial court make finding fact that case could decided even without finding fact made  thats necessary construction court  supreme court north carolina said say construed that true no sir they confirmed finding fact trial court they i dont understand record whats reason break page 28 get another heading per curiam were two opinions  no sir the  what  explanation do know im referring yes sir the statement facts get opinion do see justice stewart read followed paragraph says upon findings court concluded do i get  justice stewart read finding lower court recitation supreme court finding that correct the  supreme court included  factual background finding trial court so far material page 28 says immaterial may reason lessors unwillingness continue relationship landlord tenant and say that means  found court fact first  constitutional violation asserted fact ajusted immaterial id like say troublesome its troublesome language i think  show light record make sense thats violation due process the  facts stipulated effect executive director present testifying would testify reason they  stipulate reason none except i believe introduced affidavit asserted that belief that reason evicted third party testimony witnesses  nobody else petitioner asserted that belief  that reason theres facts inaudible no sir none if evicted reason reason claims agree would remedy court yes sir i think would remedy court evicted reason would infringe constitutional rights she hearing trial court  justice inaudible the owner complained adequacy hearing would   petitioner would desire hearing  maybe executive directors maybe housing authority commission we dont know exactly going court instituting action ejectment there legislative machinery set whereby housing authority conduct  no sir that exactly point the trial court rule way the trial court ruled way would deemed inadmissible evidence point it  it admitted  included stipulation point raised trial court  ignore find fact wasnt true now trial court deemed immaterial would inadmissible the trial court would go finding fact true they would say  would said material thats relevant outcome case that trial court thats main point the trial court said relevant i finding fact isnt true tell mr edwards regulation requires whatever form procedure takes reason stated is view reason stated rule effective arose reason actually stated project manager “im evicting because” alleges shed organized group case may then  nevertheless evicted attempted proceeding justice proceed is view circumstance validity reason would relevant right eviction yes sir i  i think that happened case didnt tell said thats and gotten far trial court concerned wouldnt make difference whether said “that reason told was” whether said “that reason i think is” well may i get back new regulation yes sir now contemplate i think that would affect case i  if may lay aside i wanted regulation contemplated its little hard exactly say im i represent hud i represent public housing administration i represent housing authority city durham we think little case context i represent commissioners bar commission citizen city durham i represent federal agency whatsoever but required i gather comply regulation i think well regulation first place it regulation its  i think less advisory sort thing and reasons i  im glad opportunity say something far applicability case concerned whatever directive recommendation ex post facto far  relationship housing authority i represent city durham north carolina federal agencies contract entered housing authority organized state law enter written contract federal agencies sets forth obligations federal agencies and one clauses contract shall obey directive issued federal agency it doesnt say so  whatever governed by contract contract  folks issued directive doesnt say pay attention first place and second place i gather effect say us use sending back reconsideration light directive regulation whatever youd call binding  landlord thats right for several reasons one  one tenant taking advantage directive likely thirdparty beneficiary contract in words whatever may call part lease though thats correct its part lease become part lease issuance thing and point i think pertinent 1961 the congress housing act 1961 part act said “the public housing agency” language means local housing authorities like one i represent“ shall adopt promulgate regulations establishing admission policies shall give full considerations responsibility rehousing displaced urban renewal governmental action applicant status servicemen veteran relationship serviceman veteran disabled serviceman veteran applicants age disability housing conditions related housing needs sources income” now law places vote that little  that housing authority durham responsibility federal agencys responsibility law mr  mr edwards could i ask  say reason authority evicting may bad one may one would bar  i think think reasons i think  or matter alleged the tenant gets sued could evicted order  shes already evicted appealed superior court trial de novo right correct and ordinary trial court ordinary trial court would suggest ordinary lawsuit may bad reason eviction want find whether bad reason exists authority could refuse suit answer lady evicted i dont think  could refuse answer discovery proceeding well  well whats fuss trial court says dont need give reason but point wouldnt concede lady entitled find evicted i  i dont think the reason  well lets  lets assume i suppose shes got right call housing authorities thats first witness procedure right right well couldnt ask would irrelevant question stand i think would irrelevant well   hasnt done point got right find evicted i  id say i think would irrelevant irrelevant i yes and  let  let point way this may sound silly  quibble reason reason theres case cited either briefs  brief called vitarelli v seaton 359 us 535 didnt involve necessarily constitutional issue secretary interior fired employee he fired  fired employee assigning reason say “you security risk” and procedures department upon firing reason hearing hearing enough evidence but court took position fired reason secretary right didnt hearing what  law think governs lease i think law state north carolina governs  lease is something  form prescribed  federal law no sir and  housing authority free adopt form its  thats correct under law state north carolina certain  in contract housing authority pha old contract says “you shall lease apartments people lease shall conform provisions contract pertinent federal statutes” but prescribe form lease shall lease usual form  but i still dont understand  trial de novo superior court lady alleges “i  i evicted certain reason” yes sir and agree prove eviction stand i agree  and  truth  prove according trial court true but i would think part proof least able ask “why  evict me” or “why ordered evicted” i dont think constitutional right ask im speaking constitutional  constitutional right im asking  whether ordinary law evidence rule evidence entitled  ask question answered i think well i thought irrelevant sorry well said irrelevant i think  i think asked question course trial might ruled irrelevant but i think discovery procedures available case superior court gets trial give full right explore possibilities i would surprised couldnt answer  ask question answered well spite  i may entirely wrong but assuming moment could ask get information case comes    could really find would  evicted then case comes whether constitutional right know beforehand thats right i think  i think comes whether constitution requires  told reason beforehand and  lets  think  lets assume regulation socalled regulation directive come would say youre bound lets assume lets also assume part lease regulation means must give reason does add anything really could find trial assuming would find i dont think would i dont think   i dont  i think whatever conference trial would limit went discovery procedures might say “no reason told isnt real reason” im sure  your answer due process due process hearing trial court thats correct and   could find evicted well upon burden saying  evicted now  well burden process making case proving case able find knew  she  going court thats im saying  machinery set hearing gets trial case except discovery proceedings set statutes and available and whats particular case say stands falls record asserted said reason and  did ever ask anybody  trial lawsuit was effort find  evicted it seems trial court said  trial court  duty upon plaintiff give defendant reason termination lease  right  hold hearing order that may literally true also  could read little broadly saying shes entitled even find well  fact matter was allowed present contended reason evidence wanted she filed affidavit based  contention allegation found fact i see wanted  burden upon show unconstitutional reason presented one gave facts found have cases around country laws governing housing authorities yes sir do cited brief we  there  state cases  cited brief  inaudible there cases  page 9 brief instances sort appears tenant given notice  lease would terminate would renewed without without reason given eviction reason held sufficient state course now universally held reason given that reason unconstitutional reason eviction wouldnt stand but also held universally wherever question arisen theres reason given constitutional requirement  notice theyre going terminate lease contain reason and give reason decide whether reason good one sufficiency reason and  distinctions pointed court vitarelli versus seaton effect didnt give reason right  eliminate employee but give reason hearing take evidence sides so say lease arbitrary line leases generally use among landlords tenants court proceeding way arbitrary full opportunity court proceeding present evidence issue constitutionality saw fit present fact issue fact decided therefore constitutional issue left case court there sort sponsored nothing budget i recall  puts recreational program educational program i think  i think areas recreation encouraged housing authority basically  landlord kind situation thats what  legal effect inaudible legal effect inaudible in opinion binding upon us you get federal funds we get federal funds you obtain inaudible theyre  get federal funds instrument called annual contributions contract entered federal government agencies and contract sets forth terms conditions whereby get federal money contribute operation project and contract written years ago this regulation  contract us federal government doesnt say directive issued federal government become incorporated contract doesnt say therefore say  contract amended directive ex post facto  i dont know the  the federal government inaudible as long  long obeyed law congress passed long complied terms contract federal government i dont believe could possibly some great many facets law relating subject i unfamiliar i couldnt answer question fully but i familiar anything im sure contract doesnt provide assessment there provision socalled directive regulation “in addition informing tenant reasons proposed eviction action date local authority shall maintain written record every eviction federally assisted public housing such records available review time time hud representatives shall contain following information” name tenant date notice three specific reasons notice vacate now thats certainly couched  somehow whoever wrote department housing urban development thought something housing authority provide it certainly sounds like but say law well i say  law but opinion representing local housing authority i would contend i see well  furthermore i  answer query i think  language thing refers reason eviction and gave reason eviction lease run lease terminated expired thats reason  basic reason evicted well  thered situations would refused application fact so really  thats really reason inaudible i  i think possibly  reason eviction stayed  no dont normally  that may inaudible leases  leases run every month inaudible thats right everybody so everybodys lease runs every month correct and dont normally evict people lease runs its automatically renewed unless give 15 days notice advance it must normal  thats right that youd normally reason renewing this unusual case theres great mass dont  dont way its  dont think constitution requires us change form lease thats unreasonable unconstitutional thats position,152.0,156,3,by supreme court north carolina page 27 record it seems i read fully accept confirm

the issue case is scope effect 522f bankruptcy code lien avoidance provision now provision allows avoidance certain liens exempt property debtor may retain bankruptcy proceedings in facts case debtor sought exempt homestead property florida time filing bankruptcy petition under florida law however property immune reason exemption attachment lien attached property prior time exemption obtained now cases decisions bankruptcy court district court court appeals concluded essentially lien avoidable property exempt sense lien attached prior time exemption right rendered property exception homestead exemption that florida law thats purely expression way florida law treated as note bankruptcy court decision critical part holding asserts states virtually precise application florida law without effect given 522f the court appeals decision specifically stated that property specifically subject exception meaning lien attaching prior right homestead remained subject lien could enforced despite later acquisition homestead right now leads us central issue involved case if whether permissible state law define exception exemption property encumbered lien in words reason property defeated exemption virtue attachment lien now lien i see nothing wrong i see nothing wrong conclusion in words i dont believe would impermissible state determine going allow homestead exemption period absolutely it wouldnt come play would exemption upon particular judicial lien attached consequently lien avoidance would come play case would the fact matter florida law provides homestead exemption on date debtor filed petition entitled assert exemption well the lien yes your honor the lien remains enforceable preexisting judicial lien state law but extent exempt particular creditor the attachment lien effect rendering homestead exemption unavailable purposes debtor later qualifies homestead even property already lien attached well i think could i i suggesting your honor im suggesting florida i suggesting florida statute regarding florida decision law regarding homestead exemptions sense invalid the issue really whether going survive lien avoidance mechanism bankruptcy proceedings there nothing wrong florida deciding going allow exemption particular creditor they going allow exemption particular creditor deny creditor right property but time doesnt prevent the homesteader achieving homestead status property could protect wide world creditor florida perfectly perfectly right allow protection given creditor that end question though the issue becomes effect 522f bankruptcy petition filed now focus note judicial lien challenged anything on date debtor filed petition entitled exemption generally florida law the bankruptcy court acknowledged under state under state law your honor correct that correct but real problem state law rule carries bankruptcy destroyed effectiveness lien avoidance provision bankruptcy because permissible florida say decision law particular lien going enforceable despite later acquisition homestead right situation carried bankruptcy going defeat effectiveness 522f the well your honor well your honor sense congress sense allow states opt but opt essentially limited types quantities property may exempted bankruptcy they allow states choose there question florida done florida florida statute effect opts florida bank federal exemptions makes reference attempting opt lien avoidance provision 522f it silent you dont yes your honor i think so i dont think i dont think florida florida hasnt made attempt evade opt lien avoidance provision it opted list quantities types property exemption may enjoyed now if we situation exception exemption case lien encumbered lien encumbrance exception exemption longer impairment exemption application 522f if disappears impairment the concept impairment disappears the exception takes out realm property upon lien avoidance could applied i dont think congress ever intended state would entitled define exemptions way could defeat operation another section code well your honor some state statutes have defined exemption laws way certain certain acts agreements undertaken creditor debtor effect waiving exemption waiving protection bankruptcy might might might accorded debtor particular property no your honor i dont 522f i think broad enough cover kind exemption well words even voluntary relinquishment protection debtor might state law wouldnt preclude asserting exemption rights bankruptcy filed lien avoidance sought that well i think significant look point view must reason lien avoidance remedy congress enacted that probably recognition reasons liens arising state law would impair exemptions might would reason state law would effect denying debtor right use exemption protect exemption bankruptcy thus deny full benefit meaning fresh start i think i think senate house versions respect legislative history indicate lien lien could avoided intended operate debtor could enjoyed exemption absence lien it recognition lien normally otherwise unaffected bankruptcy discharge would pass remain attached exempt property would frustrate debtors fresh start it i believe bankruptcy act essentially remedy avoidance liens attached property prior bankruptcy in words bankruptcy discharge effect liens they passed creditor free assert rights secured creditor following bankruptcy fresh start less fresh i think i think if permit permit fail independently apply lien avoidance provision state exemption definitions run risk result the state specifically excepts exemption creditor lien attaching lien avoidance independently applied state exemption scheme exception exemption noted court appeals case concluded exception exemption lien exception exemption taken application lien avoidance exception makes impossible assert exemption no your honor i dont i dont think that i dont think that refers situation lien it essence prospective fixing lien may many ways unrealistic view sense debt discharged may constitute lien postpetition in words i sure lien attaches point if attaches prepetition constitute impairment exemption does answer question your honor well i dont i suggesting i dont i dont think referred situation congress contemplated fixing lien time postpetition in words 522f wouldnt apply bankruptcy petition filed and prospective application i dont think thats i dont think thats congress mind well i dont think i dont think necessarily cannot i dont think situation could read apply liens attaching prior bankruptcy i dont see significance reading limited fashion thats correct your honor bankruptcy your honor bankruptcy court decision issue specifically determine particular creditors rights respect property thats thats correct it allowed general exemption well impairment exists state law property remains subject particular creditors lien well the lien avoidance provision specifically designed avoid liens impair exemptions now bankruptcy court determined debtor entitled exemption lien remains enforceable nonbankruptcy law following discharge unless lien avoided 522f gives relief it lien exemption impaired property remains subject lien lien enforceable therefore lien avoidable 522f creditor executes property debtor lost homestead no sir the lien reason lien avoided creditor would able proceed state court execute property but lien avoidance federal bankruptcy remedy preserve exemptions under i think legislative history sections code early commission bankruptcy laws 1973 great deal concern about property exempt property lost following bankruptcy liens avoided exemptions didnt effect insulating property from preexisting liens there lien avoidance remedy prior code i think lien avoidance specific federal remedy designed enhance debtors fresh start assure property exempt reason remains subject lien lien could avoided now lien avoidance remedy applies specific kinds liens f1 f2 the f1 nonconsensual judicial lien f2 limited remedy i think i think court recognize lien impaired exemption impaired impaired court appeals concluded exception lien encumbered property if lien encumbered property falls within confines f1 where f1 apply state law state legislatures create exceptions exemption schemes include definitions take property operation 522f f would rendered useless meaningless remedy definitions could include exceptions lien encumbrances id like reserve rest time your honor yes your honor yes mr chief justice the generosity lack thereof state chooses give state bankruptcy code leaves leaves but lien avoidance remedy something federally created if senate house versions legislative history make apparent lien avoided extent exemption could enjoyed absence lien i if this debtors property executed deprived exemption lone creditor this serve benefit general administration estate it serve benefit larger share his creditors this would stretch imagination pardon succeed giving debtor fresh start this asset case his lone asset homestead florida law gives homestead this lien only thing takes exemption away this lien precisely within definition terms conditions 522f1 needs avoided if permit state exceptions lien encumbered property defeat 522f return precode days liens passed bankruptcy unavoided and credi debtor remedy means securing exemption following discharge thats reason i believe that court takes independent application 522f upon whatever categories quantities types property state included within list exemptions makes independent application lien avoidance provision beyond list selected state lien must avoided if exemption definitions created state allow states evade lien avoidance concept remedy altogether thank your honor the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,383.0,473,23,well hear argument no 891008 dwight h owen v helen owen mr fishell may proceed whenever ready i cant hear could speak please you crank maybe youll way you may closer microphone that way south carolina law treated wasnt oh i sorry florida law well mr fishell could could state decide wasnt going allow exemption homesteads and wouldnt relief available 522f well florida law florida law time bankruptcy filed provided homestead exempt it provided subject lien so cant say totally exempt wasnt true florida law that lien enforceable despite homestead exception well extent property exempt you think think state couldnt say well grant homestead exemption except mechanics liens good homestead yes so could say could say sure homestead exemption good liens except mechanics liens and bankruptcy but say entitled exemption generally really doesnt say whole lot i mean entitled exemption supersede preexisting lien under state law well i think didnt congress intend permitting state opt federal scheme specify exemptions you would think would contemplated state could quali could define exemptions granting way wanted i guess case do give significance introductory clause 522f notwithstanding waiver exemptions that really necessary view way read statute or am i wrong those arent taken care 522e but needed light 522e view interpretation i dont i dont see force effect its transition previous section all right how critical language statute 522f refers exemption debtor would entitled mr fishell do give weight fact 522f say notwithstanding waiver exemption debtor may avoid lien interest debtor it says debtor may avoid fixing lien is suggestion talking referring liens attached earlier bankruptcy proceeding yes i think i think i i think i i understand saying i dont i dont understand the statute phrased way one would thought would said debtor may avoid lien interest debtor doesnt it says may avoid fixing lien its sort strange phrase maybe means nothing essentially say doesnt mean anything um hum what mind do meaning fixing i mean maybe doesnt may i ask another question referring language 522f the avoidances lien fixing lien extent lien impairs exemption debtor would entitled subsection b now i understand case property exempt claims general creditors subsection b isnt didnt effect keep property estate administration bankruptcy purposes so impairment exemption even lien survived remedy creditors secured creditors remedy perhaps state lawsuit postbankruptcy enforcement lien property retain entire exemption bankruptcy proceedings thats i understand but hold i understand property exempt didnt listed whatever asset estate which seems thats complete exemption entitled property exempt it exempt claims general creditors couldnt charged costs administration anything like so seems language i dont quite understand how say lien impaired exemption you got exemption right but thats independently bankruptcy proceeding the property exempt bankruptcy remedy maybe i maybe i missed something language but bankruptcy proceeding very well mr fishell mr dyk well hear thank mr fishell the case submitted,741.0,1037,15,mr chief justice may please court florida known bankruptcy parlance debtors state called unusually generous terms exemptions grants under federal scheme exemptions 522d 20 7500 would available homestead exemption in florida acreage limitation amount unlimited now essentially petitioner case suggesting congress section 522f intending force states generous decided i think its piece property in rural areas 160 acres urban areas half acre and respect first argument make case exemption 522f operate agreement petitioner respondent extent property covered lien simply exempt virtue section 522b there exemption extent property covered lien and suggestion 522f simply nothing operate circumstances applies would impair exemption debtor otherwise entitled there isnt exemption the bankruptcy court yes no quite what bankruptcy no well what bankruptcy court i sure opinion bankruptcy court appendix petition bankruptcy court said property exempt claims unsecured creditors i going decide initially yes he didnt thats correct and happened exemption claimed respondent filed objection exemption ground talking the respondent said exemption available extent property subject lien way florida law defines exemption and bankruptcy court view didnt quite look correctly it said well i going rule exemption i going decide lien question in view i dont think appealable wasnt adverse judgment us he hadnt decided lien question there wasnt final judgment would appealable no reserved question whether thats correct thats correct said bankruptcy court and said well i going view exempt claims general creditors i going reach question effect lien there wasnt reserved future he didnt decide future time very early bankruptcy proceedings what happens schedule property filed part bankruptcy petition the condominium issue listed exemption claimed right schedule and objection required rules filed yes there objection filed respect exemption ground exemption available florida law extent lien and bankruptcy court ultimately got around resolving question later ruling course case rather earlier ruling oh absolutely there question justice stevens i agreeing exempt property the way florida defines exemption exempt property extent covered preexisting lien it exempt extent covered preexisting lien what congress 522 right and florida could decided instead halfacre exemption could quarteracre exemption eighthofanacre exemption it decided define terms property subject preexisting lien property isnt well i well i think many cases amount lien less total amount property apparently doesnt happen case what there two kinds property in particular case probable lien greater amount property so justice stevens hypothetical wasnt property would qualify exemption subject lien in situations property probably would greater value amount lien didnt happen case and congress concerned petitioner suggested 522f meaningless construction adopted what congress concerned several things first concerned rule long bullard ancient supreme court case said even exemption matter federal law apparently lien going preserved and congress enacted 522 decided adopt rule long v bullard general matter see 522c preserve liens in particular decided preserve purchase money mortgages liens carve exception rule long bullard case judicial liens nonpurchase money nonpossessory liens and respect trying serve state policy states opted federal exemptions state define property limited way florida congress decided assist state policy voiding lien and 522f course purposes also alternative list federal bankruptcy exemptions 522f operates respect there federal nonbankruptcy exemptions it operates respect and liens created states outside debtors domiciliary state 522f operates respect also so meaningful provision respects would opt interpretation no no justice oconnor i think question would referring i think mean would entitled florida generous defining exemptions that would means would entitled means would entitled except rule long bullard words federal lien preservation policy so thats thats meaning word would and far justice scalias question fixing use word fixing i dont attribute significance either a lot people puzzled it cant mean prospectively automatic stay provision section 362 code would prevent fixing judicial lien filing bankruptcy petition so referring past well i think i think question whether example state would power allow people waive exemptions the answer dealt clause read also section 522e also talks waivers i think thats rather different question case somewhat difficult one view past supreme court cases dealing issue waiver but thats a separate question court may save day but terms ability state define property thats controversy house senate enacting section 522 and senate essentially states given right define property purposes exemption exemption effort federalize exemptions essentially failed florida right define exemption it opted federal exemption scheme and defined exemption include property extent lien nothing 522 offer yes justice stevens lets suppose example state created 400 exemption personal property consequence individual comes bankruptcy decides designates 400 worth property would like exempt now state law property may come bankruptcy subject liens 522f says circumstances state 400 exemption going avoid judicial liens nonpossessory nonpurchase money liens property that situation state made choice floridas preserve lien it silent and fairly frequent the second part argument course relates interesting question retroactivity occupied court number occasions last several years and suggest theres alternative ground need reach affirm judgment federal law construed require retroactive application state law state law clear new exemption created single people doesnt apply preexisting liens so florida theres rule retroactivity exemptions in security industrial bank case course court determined federal law 522f construed operate retroactively we suggested kener case justice holmes opinion kener case federal law construed requiring state law operate retroactively and essentially reasons court articulated holt security industrial bank articulated clearly kener case unless questions i nothing i dont i dont think it really justice oconnor the fresh start policy policy debtor carry property bankruptcy its a policy certain amount property begin and states define property states generous way florida states generous as i said beginning argument i dont think indication legislative history 522 congress somehow dissatisfied floridas generosity felt something required if hadnt done would enacted mandatory federal exemptions proposed would increased vastly increased amount exemptions florida giving people much 7500 federal exemption vast majority cases that correct there question personal liability debtor the sole question whether property going pass bankruptcy lien intact without lien intact well theres another provision bankruptcy code 506 deals i understand question correctly and 506d lien exceeds value property time bankruptcy that excess amount lien voided result passing bankruptcy so situation property worth 135000 lien 158000 result bankruptcy proceeding lien reduced 135000 yes i think amount lien ascertained 158000 i dont think determination value the value listed 135000 i dont recall dispute that,227.0,343,18,mr dyk florida homestead allowance specific dollar amount it piece property wasnt didnt bankruptcy court decide wasnt exemption i suppose file file schedule property make specific claim property exempt yes yes yes and didnt client object claim and bankruptcy court rejected well well objected didnt win well thats right thats i know lien avoidance issue time well didnt decide anyway he said said property exempt florida law bankruptcy proceeding claims general creditors subject general administration trustee we didnt appeal order i guess well literally cited saying exemption you say wasnt exemption i know you ago said said property wasnt exempt there wasnt anything 522f operate what sort phase bankruptcy proceedings bankruptcy judge made particular finding right right schedule by client yes let stop i may if property worth i dont know facts worth amount clients claim theoretically would portion available claims general creditors least established property extent exempt so its least category exempt property get around language 522f thing exemption wasnt impaired lien extent lien impairs exemption in words condominium treated though two separate parcels one parcel exempt part general creditors trying reach parcel nonexempt the problem i language statute refers interest debtor property extent lien impairs exemption forth seems to assume purposes language amount lien less total value property it talks extent impairment well not view say really two kinds property mr dyk prevail read the 522f language would entitled entitled is first phrase notwithstanding exemption waiver exemptions necessary absolute clarity e yes could i know already i didnt follow part discussion could give example avoidance judicial lien language applies thank mr well one question i may excuse your interpretation rather cut fresh start policy i suppose may i ask another question along line i gather fresh start policy clients claim opponent extent exceeded value property discharged it nondischargeable debt and lien attaches lien survives value property fluctuates how know value lien debt discharged i little puzzled maybe im stupid i now bankruptcy proceeding isnt so has amount the value lien ascertained i see okay thank thank mr dyk mr fishell rebuttal,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,5,3,651.0,156.0

Louisiana,14-280,1444712400.0,1453701600.0,Henry Montgomery,Louisiana,6.0,3.0,1,368.0,547,6,mr chief justice may please court miller v alabama established new substantive rule prohibiting mandatory life without parole juveniles applied retroactively this court jurisdiction hear henry montgomerys claim louisiana supreme court relied exclusively federal jurisprudence in miller court held mandatory life prison unconstitutional it also held life prison would uncommon rare sentence even today in case your honor louisiana supreme court state exercising independent grounds under michigan v long it interpretation earlier case louisiana supreme court said choice made choice apply teague in fact said opinion dictated teague analysis and thats done case under michigan v  they say correct choice necessarily matter state law while supreme court authority make decision said believe choosing teague believe better law therefore follow federal guidelines teague federal jurisprudence and i believe michigan v long unless state clear independent ground court conclusively presume applied federal law believed court would apply it opinion michigan v long indicates reverse your honor state must say following state law making decision were applying state law rather federal law and i believe thats sufficient indicate court applying federal law applying state law i agree your honor and even danforth court said question retroactivity pure question federal law thats answer  explanation hypothetical said state decided choosing federal law whats next step and next step question retroactivity majority descent danforth said question retroactivity pure question federal law thats correct your honor even yates court said state habeas state considers merits federal claim and merits claim is mr montgomery serving unconstitutional sentence is miller retroactive address fact hes serving unconstitutional sentence that would understanding your honor that mr  henry  jurisdiction court depend occurred far depends upon court decide but whether go federal court court doesnt affect jurisdiction court i believe today and question if  well court rules jurisdiction makes miller retroactive then obviously point would going federal court and question is mr montgomery held unconstitutionally this court miller said mandatory lifeinprison sentence unconstitutional fails address fact matter court believed kids different if clear court state court made conscious choice sent enough signal court adopting federal law use state law but case indication state  supreme court louisiana making decision they said  analysis dictated teague found mr  would apply miller retroactive thats real issue case i think louisiana would bound follow courts ruling set forth i think made conscious choice follow courts laws courts jurisprudence in must follow courts jurisprudence ive said but didnt case your honor they didnt no doesnt your honor if state considers merits federal claim must grant relief federal court  the federal claim i believe friend solicitor general  perhaps that case cited solicitor general i believe friend solicitor generals office probably answer question little bit better the point id like make  im saying your honor i dont believe need get question  under michigan v long court jurisdiction ill reserve balance time thank your honors id like make two quick points first jurisdiction resolving case teague avoids serious constitutional question whether due process requires retroactivity activity miller a second point merits miller said juvenile homicide offenders die prison chance rehabilitation consideration youth that important rule changed substantive outcomes available indeed court said life without prison uncommon the individual sentence miller remains 1500 deserve chance redemption thank you,411.0,592,9,isnt like state saying fourth amendment federal constitution fourth amendment we going apply constitution applying follow federal precedent i think would say case case decided state constitutional ground even though state court interpreting ground looking federal decisions i thought  case cited said i thought cited earlier louisiana supreme court case made clear following federal rule matter discretion  it could later opinion decide follow federal law did say taylor bound follow teague didnt say going follow teague want make clear bound theyve never  theyve never retracted i thought  i thought unless clearly state otherwise assume theyre applying federal law and clearly state otherwise they said dont follow federal law going model state law federal law it seems satisfies  exception requirement  michigan well say they said matter state law dont follow teague choose matter state law i thought thats said but mr plaisance i think people saying different standard michigan v long question its different question its state says bound follow teague we know something different want follow teague thats want and particulars all right and question if state commits following teague  doesnt think anybody else committed it self commits following teague following federal law then happens is enough federal question decide case now thats michigan v long question its like merrell dow question something like federal law  state chosen part parcel claim state committed following federal law particulars but im sorry dont finish federal statutory law right i thought point danforth reason states go beyond federal interpretation is talking federal habeas statute right how deal mr bernsteins point client would worse  correct that question comes federal habeas federal court decide  decides without aedpa problem but state court goes first federal review truncated but  answer argument all right suppose youre right victory going leave client worse position gets federal court saddled aedpa mr plaisance jurisdictional point let see i understand youre arguing a lot state rules procedure modeled federal rules procedure lot state courts simply follow federal rules but follow matter choice think theyre bound federal rules so lets say disagreement federal court federal rule evidence 403 means the state court says well know going follow federal rule think right course two divergent federal courts appeals second circuit so going follow second circuits interpretation federal rule 403 what  would jurisdiction review decision  decision question federal law suppose hold review   jurisdiction state court said going follow teague and go say teague miller applied collateral review and case goes back louisiana supreme court said well said previously taylor going follow teague based understanding teague time but see interpreted mean us supreme court going follow teague then would happen it would why because said would voluntarily follow taylor that bound they changed mind they chosen course follow jurisprudence what forces stay its matter state law theyve decided going change state law well yet agree send back look say oh thats teague means going follow teague stops and doesnt make us look foolish we rule decisions overruled somebody else youre but question whats federal claim why cite standard oil versus johnson response questions justice scalia justice alito do i  and name case standard oil v johnson are asking us decide question left  left open danforth danforth said minimum  could constitutional minimum wasnt answering question are asking us answer question but lets assume  right thank counsel mr dreeben thank counsel mr bernstein court appointed amicus curiae brief argue case courts jurisdiction you ably discharged responsibility court grateful the case submitted,1065.0,2056,34,mr chief justice may please court i going begin saying i would proceed directly merits i gather drifts argument court serious questions jurisdiction id like briefly begin were odd position respect jurisdiction we win fifth circuit federal habeas found miller retroactive why contest jurisdiction we believe still believe straightforward case not  justice kagan standard michigan v long case interwoven case meaning  state court took teague lock stock barrel now doubt justice scalia taylor  previous louisiana supreme court opinions state said voluntarily adopting teague there doubt so think question whether raises possibility advisory opinion court and say doesnt well cases like coleman v thompson ake v oklahoma court said where federal law holding integral state courts disposition matter risk advisory opinion and later coleman court said only resolution federal issue court could affect judgment risk advisory opinion so dont think risk advisory opinion of course within realm possibility we doubt going happen could happen remand louisiana supreme court could say well seen think teague were going adopt retroactivity standards states done they could the question does make courts opinion advisory and think the solicitor general  assistant solicitor general talked cases like standard oil v johnson state obligation tether state law federal standards and yet  right thats right my point justice scalia  embedded taxexemption statute the tax exemption made certain taxes exempt statute  exemption  well state  well  well respect standard oil i think  point state didnt make taxexemption statutes turn federal question it court jurisdiction resolve thats  i think thats possible court didnt make jurisdiction dependent so take case like ohio v reiner  well take  assistant solicitor general brought case ohio v reiner state made transaction unity statute turn validity fifth amendment privilege this court  court addressed embedded discrete federal issue well think  agree we think binding  quoteunquote binding within meaning binding federal law state chosen never shown wouldnt you know   think look court disagrees us  i dont think  well  teague  teague standard discrete federal standard state made  incorporated way  well louisiana supreme court could  defendant could go federal habeas sure could get interpretation way but doesnt seem us difference federal habeas review state supreme court decision makes difference respect courts jurisdiction it might mean court would wait know   i dont know robust split develop take federal case way but case  goes second reason havent strongly contested jurisdiction robust split direct  specific issue extends something like 21 state federal courts theyre deciding federal issue so seems us practical matter court ought weigh its going weigh sooner later either federal habeas court state court of course matters justice scalia course i think makes sense were saying were saying federal issue generally interwoven state law theres independent state grounds court jurisdiction decide case otherwise wait federal habeas case proceeding merits in miller court invited  that answers question well thats  thats position and way  the application teague miller well  the teague  teague standard  you and thats take position thats particularly  we want say case your honor you left question open danforth come  that difficult question dont take position but answer question justice sotomayor   argument goes danforth made clear teague  equitable interpretation federal habeas statute constitutionally binding states court left open whether exceptions binding exceptions part parcel justice harlans mackey understanding  thought federal habeas ought apply and whereas  whereas atkins  i mean atkins creates binding constitutional right the question remedy though the question state constitutionally bound offer remedy and court recognized cases like pennsylvania v finley example states wide discretion structuring post conviction and  next point though finality well  well i mean  question so court found theres substantive check due process griffith talking direct review when talking collateral review  i mean view although havent taken position collateral review different animal purposes  but court never held unless  i understand it   serious question we   taken position question feel case interwoven federal law matter state retroactivity in miller  merits in miller court invited categorically bar penalty life without parole juveniles commit murder decided now decision leads directly conclusion view miller substantive rule teagues first exception consideration teague framework teague policies teague precedent points instead conclusion miller procedural substantive rule so think summerlin helpfully sets framework ought govern question yes sure we dont think justice kagan mandatory aspect goes manner imposing penalty well   hypothetical doesnt go manner imposing penalty different miller miller made clear mandatory aspect penalty goes manner imposing penalty   substance well  justice kagan  relevant difference terms teague analysis court miller take punishment life without parole distinction category punishment life without parole table this court never held noncategorical rule substantive teague and done good reasons would fly face policies inform teague analysis i  i understand but making sentence different doesnt necessarily mean make substantive teague framework heres another way looking the defendant  juvenile murderer committed  committed murder serving lifewithoutparole sentence today premiller facing punishment law cannot impose and know miller miller said courts decision preclude punishment and goes finality the finality interests underlying convictions yield state still power impose punishment finality interests yield  justice harlan explained mackey court adopted teague finality interests yield state lacks power thats finality interests crumble speak state longer impose category penalty so would go roper it would go graham it would go justice breyers sedition witch crimes if   somebodys jail accused witch state finality interest keeping person jail but token   punishment death juvenile state finality interests so leaving punishment table crucial if doesnt take substantive the second policy reason teague avoiding adverse consequences retrial and think miller even clearly substantive standard categorical rules apply retroactively justice harlan explained dont carry adverse consequences retrial they dont make go back redo trial unearth old facts  drain state resources come distorted  distorted retrials miller nature envisioned factintensive hearing considers multiple characteristics time crime thats right that  thats right but thats course miller would require thats graham would require justice kennedy graham obviously categorical rule says longer impose punishment give parole hearing meaningful way release miller step whether give parole hearing whether person eligible parole outset thats inquiry talking miller thats quite different parole hearing the fact matter though applying miller retroactively inevitably turns miller  retroactive miller hearing parole hearing  shows doesnt quite work terms adverse  well lets take first one point its implicit concept ordered liberty the way  watershed rule stated first first prong it alter understanding bedrock procedural elements necessary fundamental fairness and would strange case find miller doesnt represent bedrock revolution sentencing practices it takes sentencing practice another area puts new area so incremental change sense its wholesale discovery new bedrock procedural element way  case like gideon v wainwright so   i think court explained whorton v bockting enough rule fundamental  abstract sense right but represent change bedrock procedural understandings and dont think miller we also dont think necessary accurate determination sentence it would enhance accuracy sentence necessary and point court never hold  held pure sentencing rule qualify watershed court many occasions said watershed rule necessary accurate determination guilt innocence talking sentence so  agree united states watershed procedural analysis way go raise interesting question in summerlin   part company quite strongly united states  united states says need outcomeexpanding alteration definition substantive rules teague we say thats  thats slight tweak teague what is change understanding substantive rule substantive rules teague analysis never depended frequency new outcomes might  might come new procedures in fact summerlin  goes back original point framework summerlin explained criminal defendant procedural rule opportunity getting lenient outcome new procedures so  nonetheless summerlin said procedural rules applied retroactively and  justice alito saying difference substantive procedural rule teague whether likely very likely result new outcome its whether new rule categorically removes power state impose category punishment thats  thats categorical rule that miller right miller may express expectation way miller hearings come and may may come  come pass future who knows right we point cases criminal defendants miller hearings still received life without parole and i point several particular state louisiana new miller procedures but point idea changing outcomes united states entire argument depends built procedural side teague substantive side the substantive side  and  well theres doubt  right miller  miller quite clearly said know justice kagan categorically bar penalty    mean penalty its  well think thats  well i  look i  i  i hope responsive i mean i think miller would see two categories punishment table we would see lifewithoutparole category lifewithparole example but point is miller doesnt ban first category determinative whether something substantive rule it  puts element table i think could say yes right you could still  absolutely still and   well  right it   life without parole floor ceiling course its   got floor ceiling what miller create   procedural circumstances finding  putting new penalty table   thats point united states argument there new possibility and point say putting new possibility table doesnt take away states power impose old category punishment duncan im sorry that   probably  probably your honor but  question   course preteague case it raises question is woodson substantive procedural teague and argument procedural rule its procedural rule  right it required individualized sentencing   process say procedure it  would put new  they certainly could question whether substantive procedural teague rubric course preteague case i think say substantive teague reasons said now raise question watershed procedural rule perhaps thats  thats first one but every eighth amendment sentencing rule goes accuracy significant  well take  havent talked capital sentencing cases take case like odell capital jury informed defendants parole eligibility considering future dangerousness i mean one could easily say accuracy resulting death sentence old rule seriously diminished yet court said odell that watershed procedural rule and go line cases beard case sawyer case those cases defendant could said well seriously diminished accuracy and yet court found watershed rule and course bedrock word court used referring exception particularly whorton v bockting well court said doubtful emerge so think case implausible case new watershed rule emerge since rule  back bedrock point  creating   revolution bedrock standing procedure its  incremental step sentencing juveniles so case like crawford watershed procedural rule difficult understand one would well disagree there cases  take  take case refused make retroactive rule caldwell v mississippi thats eighth amendment case goes accuracy capital jury sentence determination death and court didnt make rule retroactive found procedural nonwatershed time so take issue just words united states proposed expansion teague it would  would shift whole focus substantive rule categorical nature rule effects rule and  defendant capital sentencing cases weve talking odell sawyer beard would argument handed united states new rule says well new rule gave opportunity better outcome i might gotten death penalty jury properly instructed we dont understand united states new rule case cabined mandatory sentence taken table well i  well i push back premise little bit  position substantive rule punishments table a substantive rule whether state categorically longer power impose category punishment here clear miller opinion grayer  graham opinion relevant category life without parole the state still ability impose punishment thats  thats sharp distinction procedural rule and united states new conception substantive rule would blur  would blur and would call question capital sentencing cases  i heard question  i dont remember justice asked  booker and reaction booker matter sixth amendment made sentencing underline mandatory surely opened new sentencing outcomes and reason could federal habeas petitioner say united states new test booker retroactive alleyne matter alleyne overturned mandatory minimum sixth amendment opening new sentencing outcomes why couldnt federal defendant federal habeas say now i ought get benefit rule retroactively our position cases booker alleyne apprendi clearly procedural court explained  summerlin  sierra v summerlin theyre clearly procedural teague rubric and united states would blur categories if questions,742.0,1111,18,it didnt say though in  standard oil  quote opinion relationship post exchanges government united states controlled federal law well would true matter state right were deciding question federal law would applied dont think state made taxexemption law turn federal law federal constitutional requirements area could state taxed  i mean question whether supremacy clause would permit state tax sales post exchanges in provision i quoted said relationship post exchanges united states controlled federal law thats opinion says and mr duncan isnt quite similar justice scalia used controlled language louisiana supreme court used similar language its dictated teague now dictated teague theyve chosen make dictated teague choice made outcomes dictated teague its issue well ohio v reiner cited way state could obtained review state supreme courts erroneous determination witness question fifth amendment privilege said didnt commit crime and think thats distinction case case we weigh jurisdiction you dont think matters what said doesnt really make much sense lets get quickly whether jurisdiction youre saying we clearly jurisdiction dont im trying figure in mind jurisdiction person  thats defendant  defendant says courts decision  thats courts decision  contrary constitution statute united states thats say so jurisdiction answer question now question dispose case jurisdiction and three instances i guess court done disposing case solicitor general says namely said  going say whether hes right saying contrary constitution thats might adequate state ground might their adequate state ground one  elucidated explained flowing certain interpretation federal law we say interpretation federal law wrong well send back see is right have i got right what federal law youre talking thats federal law federal habeas statute federal law right and teague interpretation federal law was federal law issue case of course wasnt but teague standard  teague exceptions could well constitutionally required the teague exception  have ever said you want us hold case did say opposite danforth could tell would think something like atkins would retroactive states as compulsion meaning election teague retroactivity it something different justice breyer pointed wide discretion structure want but structured way youre going say im offering due process isnt check substantive check due process   offer minimum but number cases states viewed exceptions controlling fact offer constitutional minimum hasnt yet and shouldnt thats really serious question mr duncan   i give hypothetical i mean   suppose state  mandatory minimum theft it says mandatory minimum theft 20 years and suppose court looks says know thats incredibly disproportionate lot theft strikes mandatory minimum says cant mandatory minimum like make lower would substantive ruling it go manner imposing it says nothing manner imposing what it increases range sentencing possibilities it actually leaves  courts it says absolutely nothing factors ought taken account nothing all says cant mandatory minimum 20 years theft make lower but i think  so youre saying thats different something else miller there something else miller there bunch there   process component miller question court says courts supposed look  characteristics youth supposed try figure whether terrible crimes functions part immaturity   whether  really looking incorrigible defendant so process component but process component take away fact completely separate selfsufficient component range punishment thats completely fours hypothetical i gave no youre exactly right it take lwop punishment table but similarly hypothetical 20year sentence theft taken table what court done say options there option ten years five years two years  whatever so theyve expanded range possibilities theyve made sentences different sentence defined upper end lower end so made sentence different but dont distorted new trial youre granted parole hearing you going say  point started suppose look watershed procedural change my  impression case cited summerlin deciding whether thats retroactive parts i think unanimous point the two parts is implicit concept ordered liberty and would seem applicable states and second is central accurate determination life without parole legally appropriate punishment and   rule mandatory cant exist central making  whole point miller opinion so thats correct analysis watershed rule procedural rule thats retroactive  im accurate doesnt fit within category mr duncan i  i  i think i think definition fits substantive side you said  categorically remove certain outcome and   thats exactly miller if  long understand sentence i think agreed defined upper  lower end effectively court said miller that sentence mandatory lwop sentence cannot control juveniles there different sentence one includes punishments that  increases range it allows something within range  completely changed range thats   given juvenile defendant and range important its top end this said alleyne cant think sentence without thinking parts sentence maximum minimum and decide whether substantive change sentence made look maximum minimum im  i would  i would describe changing range sentences available changing sentence it doesnt change sentence   necessarily but  you still get sentence which said last year we said possible disassociate floor sentencing range penalty affixed crime and similarly said criminal statutes long specified floor ceiling sentencing ranges evidence define legally prescribed penalty that penalty is range mr winsor  mr winsor   i know didnt ever look issue im sorry reading wrong one i apologize but really think  state would applied woodson retroactively they why it said couldnt mandatory death penalties just like cant mandatory life without parole it says exactly  and give sentences less   mandatory death but could still given death all right but thats language  bedrock i dont think right language language referred sentences mackey correct ive looking and  teague justice oconnor tries get right words  ends procedural first test first part  addressed limiting scope second exception  thats watershed rule  new procedures without likelihood accurate conviction seriously diminished okay and thats joined chief justice justice scalia fourth i cant remember but seriously diminished now read miller pretty hard say i mean goodness miller filled paragraph paragraph mandatory requirement life without parole fails take account characteristics many characteristics adherent youth and pretty hard come away without thinking gee accuracy mandatory life without parole seriously diminish accuracy imposing life without parole apply mandatory youth no but say accuracy seriously diminished and says then i dont think many cases is watershed procedural rule gideon we one brief tells us court never barred punishment cruel unusual eighth amendment refused make decision retroactive well i think cabined said difference one  category cases refer process decisionmaker makes particular result another category cases refer weve called substance results table category punishment table and thats difference kinds things youre mentioning this  partly theres also punishments table thank counsel mr bernstein three minutes remaining,606.0,889,9,mr chief justice may please court the issue whether decide question millers retroactivity case federal habeas case johnson v manis no 151 courts docket in todays case jurisdiction question point section 1257 enforce supremacy clause and supremacy clause states quote laws united states unquote apply quote judges   key words  every state shall bound thereby there thing supreme federal law depends whether particular state voluntarily makes federal precedence binding when state state voluntarily adopts nonbinding federal precedence creates right federal law 1257 requires michigan v long apply i would say lack binding federal law question antecedent requirement borrow terminology sgs brief get adequate independent state ground analysis you certainly jurisdiction answer question whether teague constitutionally required state collateral review courts the second part brief said constitutionally required state collateral review courts thats basically courts precedence danforth back beginning desist kaufman said teague  become teague exceptions matters equitable discretion matters constitution federal habeas statute face applies federal court so federal habeas court grant relief relief warranted teague exception well i think your honors opinion court martinez v ryan   132 supreme court 1319 1320 suggested advantages citing federal habeas right federal habeas statute rather court called freestanding constitutional claim a major advantage say state courts bound teague exceptions constitution goes federal habeas deferential aedpa review if say redress question rationale danforth indicated state court matter state law issue goes federal habeas aedpa apply state court decided federal issue and  major difference you would actually weakening federal habeas statute recognize jurisdiction case and court benefit de novo percolation lower federal courts lower habeas courts window theres jurisdiction case lower federal habeas courts able courts reviewing appeal apply highly differential aedpa review no it would supremacy clause binds states direct proceedings collateral proceedings old rule thats equivalent direct proceeding but talking retroactivity new rule  thats teague  two teague exceptions apply they apply new rules they apply collateral review and based statuary equitable discretion rather constitution but court already held direct review application old rules present federal questions because standard oil issue underlying status federal government arm court said question controlled federal law standard oil like miller issue what eighth amendment require thats federal constitutional issue applied in standard oil combination statute regulations federal common law federal law controlled question here statute doesnt apply state court danforth numerous cases held like federal rules evidence dont apply state court even though many courts follow similar provisions certainly follow federal precedence interpreting similar rules correct i think difference makes case special court held since murdock v city memphis almost hundred fifty years ago 87 us 326 327 1267 jurisdiction question question it like 1331 case case it question question and i believe court jurisdiction skip question whether federal law applies answer hypothetical federal law applied would i think question whether federal law applies jurisdiction well  yes well hypothetical respectfully i dont think would new rule it would old rule  if genuinely new rule   danforth going way back the  justice harlans opinion mackey said creating substantive exception constitution requires  well new rule court held  sorry cite precedent  linkletter held retroactivity collateral review constitutional that aspect  but teague said dont like linkletter because  well violate constitution fair enough fair enough fair enough but  constitution according cases satisfied federal habeas remedy i think schweiker  this court reluctant even violation due process clause create judicial remedy implied judicial remedy top federal statutory remedy thats schweiker v chilicky cited briefs and i think especially reluctant  and question whether issue retroactivity federal constitutional issue if obviously theres jurisdiction if i would submit jurisdiction proper remedy federal habeas if i may reserve remainder time thank what fantastic discussion shown court always past keep teague exceptions matter equitable discretion rather constitutional requirement the court much freedom generally speaking matter equitable discretion constitutional requirements there way look prior precedents court teague courts say oh heres equitable discretion the time get retroactivity constitution requires that would really short opinion and now turn quickly cases cited the critical difference case one hand merrill dow three affiliated tribes hand jurisdiction statute question question murdock in merrill dow question whether defendants conduct violated federal drug labeling laws federal question the court never would gone say also going federalize remedy were going decide whether lost profits outofpocket costs similarly three affiliated tribes question federal statute limited state court jurisdiction the issue scope statute here opposite there question federal statute apply state court yet people say decide scope question even though underlying issue may one state law and finally list generals new cakeandeatittoo argument going reviewed court de novo review habeas statutory language 2254 d pretty broad it quote any claim adjudicate indicated merits state court proceeding the claim case remedy this case filed miller decided the issue case redress and would wonderful turn could say one hand 2254 d doesnt apply hand 2757 applies  requires quote right claimed federal law gets question justice kagan is enough state court says voluntarily want bound and best answer cases i would recommend moore cited merrill dow goes way show federal law binding intrastate commerce conduct case saying court could review also plain language supremacy clause binding federal law means binding 50 states thats statute also says right federal law thank you,320.0,473,8,well hear argument first morning case 14280 montgomery v louisiana mr bernstein so would describe adequate independent state ground  decision rested so dont jurisdiction answer question if state says acknowledge holding prisoner contravention federal law choose nothing answer federal habeas corpus second answer state required supremacy clause procedures enforce federal law and  im  i take  argue second position im quite sure case i would support it wouldnt  yeah in effect saying supremacy clause binds states direct criminal proceedings i mean another way phrasing argument how differentiate case standard oil but say that state could define exemption way wanted and could  almost identical would announce federal law send back the state already said going follow teague i guess might might free change mind how   suppose  lets think first teague exception suppose  substantive matters suppose many states sedition laws make certain conduct unlawful thousand people prison this court new rule holds cannot criminalize behavior all right what law would make retroactive people prison it sounds isnt like kind statutory discretion rather human beings prison without violated valid law always protected first amendment and thats right constitution due process clause says held  even though committed crime 22 years ago held confinement without due process law cannot criminalize behavior do see im going that federal constitution rule exceptions teague teague drops case the question whether satisfy two exceptions ive made new rule for purposes hypothetical im making new rule yeah danforth case saying states could generous it wasnt case  case thats opposite generous can stingy and i cannot find anything  harlan  maybe ill read i cant find anything i find anything danforth answers question so i thought new question hence question i posed i wanted get response i dont think answer means precedent i think try figure without help precedent thats true but teague teague saying dont like linkletter    all right but youre saying  maybe thats wrong i mean doesnt violate constitution hold person prison 20 years conduct constitution forbids making criminal it wasnt criminal time  i mean wasnt prohibited constitution time convicted right that would reason that would reason is anything else say because i say witch witch there people salem imprisoned witch and low behold 1820 held court that violated constitution now see i make outrageous example thing and  i want say okay i got point it didnt violate constitution time ive also got point authority anything else thats happening mr bernstein i mean assume premise justice breyers question constitutional violation keeping somebody prison conduct cant criminalized the state set collateral review mechanism were asking set new mechanism hasnt it collateral review mechanism question whether going comply federal constitutional law collateral review mechanism thank counsel mr plaisance thank counsel and mr plaisance three minutes remaining,701.0,1068,13,thank mr chief justice may please court this court jurisdiction decide question millers retroactivity louisiana voluntarily incorporated law wholly federal standard and courts decisions standard oil merrell dow three affiliated tribes recently ohio v reiner court recognized state chooses adopt federal law guide decisions binds federal law federal question does united states  thats right thats right and true michigan v long case what michigan v long said court jurisdiction section 1257 resolve state court resolutions federal law presume state constitutional decision mirror image say fourth amendment binding recognized circumstance court treat federal law governing questions state makes clear would reach result state constitutional law federal law it preclude option state going back reaching different decision enlightened court content federal law standard oil completely clear it says state chose use federal law determine whether federal post exchange federal instrumentality and going correct understanding federal law but remand state freed misapprehensions federal law decide thinks state law requires and may federal constitutional question so i  i  well i doubt  i doubt that would satisfy court and theres theoretical answer theres practical answer let give practical answer first the states copy federal rules evidence federal rules civil   procedure pretty uniformly say treat federal precedent guidance decisions  persuasive value they recognize state rules procedure state rules evidence belong state well i  i think  there  distinction case that may suggest case court jurisdiction one court i think stronger case im doubtful court would jurisdiction choose exercise  i accept premises argument your honors hypothetical but real world doesnt happen well i think court  so several reasons justice alito first i dont think  going come way court thats way states treat rules procedure i dont think difficult there principle courts cases federal law adopted federal law court review even state could chosen different path so  well i  i think justice kennedy  this  im trying say  the state adopted teague reason exist civil procedure cases state knows that federal law applied case habeas case so state decided consciously synchronize law law knows applied and actually serves important federalism purpose the state says rectify  constitutional error case thats become final would like opportunity and federal habeas court going treat decision retroactive would like first crack california  no  no theres elementary reason thats justice scalia answers justice ginsburgs question earlier 2254d applies state determinations merits thats time deference provision kicks and determination teague threshold determination comes decision merits this court said number cases merits resolution case so deference state determination retroactivity would never occur what i  certainly mr chief justice the  rule miller v alabama view substantive rule goes far beyond merely regulating procedure youths sentenced homicide crimes it compelled state adopt new substantive sentencing options option less severe life without parole the time court ever invalidated mandatory sentencing provision woodson v north carolina 1976 so went something like 36 years another decision concluded law must change accommodate compelling interests characteristics youth mitigate culpability considered sentencing process yes i believe would that would remedy court ordered graham v florida case  case held youths commit homicide convicted crimes cannot sentenced life without parole and courts remedy problem could either sentence term years could also simply converting lifewithoutparole sentence lifewithparole sentence so would  so i  i think justice sotomayor key difference respect guidelines always  minimum maximum set statute and guidelines even mandatory preclude judges sentencing outside guidelines depending upon presence aggravating mitigating factors werent taken account and justice alitos opinion court united states v rodriguez recognized even top mandatory guidelines range truly mandatory so even mandatory guidelines sixth amendment purposes treated established elements offense purposes looking mandatory way booker brought procedural change justice sotomayor i dont think substantive use word daylight petitioners position the description crime issue punishable mandatory life imprisonment treating category i think sums reality happening we broke component parts i think facilitates analysis understand miller procedural component sentencing courts must consider mitigating characteristics age also fundamentally view contains substantive component required change law now change expanding range outcomes previously court analyzed substantive changes law changes restricted form outcome say example justice breyers hypothetical forbidding punishment but i think trace back origins substantive category justice harlans opinion mackey still faithful justice harlan mind justice harlan said clearest case injustice applying rule retroactively puts limits altogether criminal punishment he say case and i think consider going miller reasons rule court made clear believed 2000 people prison mandatory life juvenile homicide court believed that penalty frequently disproportionate would uncommonly imposed future sentence consistent cases mitigating characteristics youth recognized roper graham miller probably last justice alito when  court characterized substantive rules recently summerlin opinion  well i would put words court used previously the court said substantive rule creates significant risk person serving sentence thats appropriate person maybe even legally available purpose it say absolutely conclusively proves it said significant risk and contrast court talked procedural rules rules govern manner case adjudicated said likelihood potential different outcome speculative and i think put case speculative significant risk axis case falls significant risk domain precisely reasons court said deciding miller the reasons court decided miller reduced culpability youth capacity youth mature change achieve degree rehabilitation consistent something less harsh sentence available youths commit murder a terrible crime still harshest sentence court thought would reserved worst worst fact louisiana said amended statutes substantively conform miller it said life without parole reserved worst offenders commit worst crimes so combine fact rule governs procedure doesnt govern evidence it also mandates changes outcomes available option genesis miller rule conclusion people class appropriateness punishment harshest degree life without parole relatively uncommon it seems clear miller rule falls substantive side axis rather procedural side axis yes yes the majority states close call i think maybe ten seven ten eight but majority states reviewed concluded miller retroactive most done matter substantive law there couple opinions talk watershed exception way think case analyzed but states done united states taken position respect juveniles sentenced miller life without parole mandatory sentence and resentencings taken place far  ten  defendants almost uniformly received sentences terms years significantly shorter life i havent broken numerically  may i answer mr chief justice i broken numerically justice ginsburg michigan applied retroactively large population juveniles miller class and i dont think pennsylvania resolved certainly favorably yet defendants thank you,229.0,384,9,this might  they change mind right you said voluntarily chose follow and voluntarily choose theyre going follow anymore how work it  pretty elementary  i mean i looked indian case seems little far the    though definitely gives support statement suppose took justice scalias example we iowa state rule 56 we interpret iowa state rule 56 way federal rules civil procedure thats rule and means case and say but iowa state rule now say review said iowa state rule federal is right now i  fit words 1257 yeah well say particular case guidance its great guidance we agree our interpretation federal interpretation now review fact wasnt federal interpretation but review yes so say court example federal rules civil procedure justice scalia gave okay its thought well say thats doubtful case i think implicitly acknowledging adopt argument going get case lots similar cases going to parse words   words used state supreme court well following  going guided were going strongly guided were going adopt were going get cases why go road   theres perfectly available possibly superior remedy available petitioner filing federal habeas petition mr dreeben whats problem  pardon did misspeak when  federal law adopted state law federal courts review isnt meant say or   i mean youre  youre careful dont make mistakes i  you  said    state law adopts federal law federal law theres review okay youre  youre  youre saying hurray  federal habeas court thereafter bound   state got first could  i going suggest maybe hear little bit merits would enough   enough states simply say okay with respect people mandatorily sentenced life without parole going provide parole mr dreeben explain articulation test wouldnt apply guideline changes booker made what substantive difference  pardon use word  formulation petitioners formulation he says substantive away mandatory life imprisonment youre articulating slightly different tell see difference articulation would accurate say rule substantive makes particular outcome less likely much less likely much much less likely previously case the difference much less likely much much less likely and states treated miller retroactive   state habeas so population dealing states apply miller retroactively i think figure 2000 people life without parole sure thank

petitioner owns operates private landfill st clair county michigan in 1988 michigan amended solid waste management act yes sir by adopting waste importation restrictions namely section 13a subsection 2 section 30 act prohibit case st clair county importation country municipal solid waste generated outofcounty outofstate on face case presents question whether waste importation restrictions prohibiting importation outofstate waste petitioners landfill impermissibly discriminate outofstate commerce incounty municipal waste subject constraint thats correct sir this plain garbage this hazardous waste this lowlevel radioactive waste yes sir under regulations promulgated state michigan transportation municipal solid waste moisture laden must transported trucks sealed capable leaking in case municipal solid waste must covered carried manner create nuisance the would true new regulations in case justice oconnor one suggested quarantine cases applicable in first place nothing first place regulations promulgated michigan make clear risk disease pestilence coming state new regulations promulgated federal epa make clear need risk disease pestilence indeed michigan allows outofstate waste come michigan albeit minor extent neighboring states so i dont think quarantine cases applicable michigan suggested applicable one amicus suggested quarantine cases may applicable may well in states regulations laws lax create risks thats true michigan there even important question however stake case thats whether court going uphold novel new constitutional principle relied upon sixth circuit upholding waste importation restrictions that new constitutional principle state legislation excludes foreign commerce local areas within state discriminate interstate commerce long like commerce elsewhere state subject embargo acceptance new principle would extraordinary consequences by way illustration principle adopted court district comprised southern counties southern california could impose embargo upon discriminatory tariff upon goods coming arizona long like commerce coming northern california subject constraint discriminatory tariff that principle simply cannot allowed stand court it hopelessly inconsistent prior decisions court belies basic principles underlie commerce clause would eventually result evisceration negative aspects yes justice scalia justice oconnor there question mind sixth circuit applied incorrect test in judgment discrimination exists courts decision decisions past made perfectly clear strict scrutiny test apply doesnt make difference state respondents seem suggest local discrimination versus statewide discrimination somehow sixth circuit made distinction well brimmer v rebman decided 1891 dean milk v city madison 1954 polar ice cream creamery co court held immaterial purposes determining whether discrimination interstate commerce instate commerce subject constraint and decisions brimmer v rebman dean milk polar ice cream creamery co theyre consistent theyre part line nine cases court past 119 years consistently repeatedly held embargoes foreign commerce statewide local overt disguised violate commerce clause this case present new concept well case question the theres question landfill engaged commerce what landfill wishes people wish waste brought landfill wish engage interstate commerce bringing municipal solid waste landfill thats correct justice scalia thats i agree justice scalia it would discriminatory thats infirmity statute the discrimination made citizens businesses states instance prohibited bringing municipal solid waste st clair county whereas citizens businesses st clair county free put waste landfill without constraint that discrimination whats impermissible if choose that would i cant address whether would permissible it would violate view i arguing today i think correct i think thats county objecting yes justice oconnor well alternative to extent municipal solid waste starts respective homes respective businesses contains materials removed solid waste recyclables plastics aluminum like i municipal solid waste brought landfill currently processing municipal solid waste i think problem suggesting municipal solid waste article commerce suggested briefs implicit questions neutral principle would apply is reach end usefulness longer articles commerce that first neutral principle would likewise apply dead dead human beings would make funeral home business cemetery business engaged commerce in manner i think clear congress would think power regulate funeral home industry cemetery industry regulating matter interstate commerce also suggest article commerce rather municipal solid waste article commerce to deny reality this multibillion dollar business suggest article commerce ignore reality other problem expropriating existing privatelyowned landfills i think county would power state would power prohibit operation private landfills well i wouldnt private landfill case but i dont dont question state market participant doctrine restrict outofstate waste coming state stateowned countyowned landfills the citizens businesses county st clair county opportunity put municipal solid waste petitioners private landfill whereas citizens businesses outofcounty dont opportunity well i think broader it true court talked repeatedly terms economic protectionism recognized virtually nine embargo cases court struck past 119 years involved argument part state statute justified legitimate purpose the reason statutes struck embargo means achieving purpose impermissible it was unconstitutional well also cited state rather city contended needed local requirement processing milk order able adequately inspect but court buy well i i think trying protect need local expenditures protect citizens competition let illustrate i may it clear briefs respondents amici landfills natural resources they engineered manufactured facilities sited anywhere depending solely cost in words that case statutes designed restrict free flow municipal solid waste state reserve private landfills enable state county avoid costs creating new landfills also avoid competition what theyre trying take effect private landfill petitioner make available state use st clair question creating space st clair county state michigan states create space its natural resource it simply erecting manufacturing effect ship land safe disposal municipal solid waste so question running space its question incurring cost create space thats state doesnt want and fact want protect incur cost future preventing citizens states bringing municipal solid waste st clair county i think thats essence economic protectionism there question justice scalia thats we unable accept higher prices offered outofstate citizens businesses mr chief justice i also point question whether is economic protectionism in case maine v taylor court found embargo permissible bait fish likely infected parasites nonetheless subjected maine statute strict scrutiny test the twofold test one whether statute serves legitimate purpose two whether available nondiscriminatory means and case maine bait fish statute statute passed test i submit case legislation waste importations pass strict scrutiny test i dont think quarantine cases present threat they havent claimed present threat would hard pressed since take outofstate albeit limited quantities id like return moment problem local regional discrimination the problem matter constitutional principle regional discrimination puts citizens region preferred region different footing citizens states they therefore tend james madison said connecticuts discriminatory tariff 1784 beget retaliating regulations less expensive vexatious destructive general harmony these regional discriminations regional embargoes enable state place position economic isolation ultimately lead evasion strictures commerce clause thats exactly pennsylvania proposes new legislation the governor proposed divide pennsylvania four quadrants called waste sheds each waste shed allowed accept municipal solid waste within waste shed the result every citizen business pennsylvania place put municipal solid waste one outside pennsylvania able bring municipal solid waste pennsylvania i dont think court ever upheld discriminatory legislation discriminates foreign articles commerce foreign citizens businesses basis temporary planning measure there quarantine cases well i dont think would take strict scrutiny test strict scrutiny test applied whenever discrimination found it may could subject strict scrutiny test hypothetical conclude purpose legitimate available alternative a finite period time decide youre going handle might well fall category this case course fit category this forever ban i dont think pike test would ever applicable hypothetical described doesnt mean couldnt pass scrutiny apparently recognizing court likely hold waste importation restrictions discriminate interstate commerce respondents amici suggested number novel theories upon would court distinguish city philadelphia v new jersey even overrule would ask court hold waste importation restrictions violate indeed even subject commerce clause we attempted address novel arguments reply brief anticipate extend brief merits i propose oral argument i think appropriate spend moment addressing states apparent principle claim sporhase v nebraska justifies different result sporhase held state statute portion state statute prohibited exportation water across state line unconstitutional so rather help state case sporhase dictates conclusion state statute prohibits importation municipal solid waste across state lines violates commerce clause also extent sporhase condoned discriminatory requirement exportation water allowed permit irrelevant case in first place discriminatory permit far less onerous constitutional matter outright discriminatory embargo in second place permit available there means permit one could obtain right bring municipal solid waste county in addition sporhase doesnt even appear permit requirement discriminatory the instate use subject extraordinary constraints indeed landowner district involved sporhase couldnt even sell water and finally sporhase recognized involved special scarce natural resource water always subject special consideration court whereas dealing engineered manufactured facility capable sited anywhere depending solely cost well i think clear briefs respondents amici thats longer necessary you required indeed one looks regulations promulgated epa liners new landfills avoid problem choose particular soil you dont want put earthquake zone i certainly agree but i described akin building ship top land this court never upheld discriminatory embargo except case necessary quarantine a quarantine quarantine cases arent applicable would principle basis court uphold discriminatory embargoes if questions id like reserve remainder time the section 13a subsection 2 act prohibit public private landfill in county accepting waste municipal solid waste unless expressly authorized county plan in 1988 time waste importation restrictions enacted times thereafter st clair county plan permit importation municipal solid waste outofcounty so act moment passed times since barred absolutely importation municipal solid waste st clair county it i challenging act incorporates st clair county solid waste management plan effect time that correct it face incorporating st clair county solid waste management plan effect either case result the suggestion safety concern i dont briefs record obviously one wants handle municipal solid waste manner doesnt create safety problem and i think case michigan regulatory legislative scheme prevents safety problem long handled accordance requirements act regulations i also want point new epa regulations need safety problem indeed new regulations specifically state minimum national criteria prescribed therein insure protection human health environment with respect suggestion michigan special place bearing burden i want call courts attention decision court edwards v california there california attempted impose criminal sanctions upon anyone brought indigents state california california contended period depression indigents coming state would put state extraordinary strains allowed avoid burden court know rejected contention commerce clause grounds i also want point every state bears burden byproducts states for example connecticut bears burden soot smoke pollution comes michigans factories no one would suggest take retaliatory steps connecticut prevent michigan way preventing michigan products coming connecticut otherwise alleviate burden here michigan seeks impose burden believes undertaking no garbage coming landfill none allowed there proposal bring i recall new york area i finally want point michigan states believed commerce clause causes burdens find unacceptable thats political question there 21 states joined amici michigan creates 22 states 44 senators power something as justice mckenna said west v kansas natural gas turning backward must done authority another instrumentality court that congress responsibility act matter hasnt chosen i would hope states exert sufficient influence either populace seems one thats populace seems objecting anything placement landfills ones elect senators and dont like i think exert political pressure get political change if questions thank much the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,460.0,598,34,well hear argument next no 91636 fort gratiot sanitary landfill v michigan department natural resources mr finn may proceed thats port huron i take waste kind talking last case and garbage element commerce i guess is waste could ever said hazardous transport well would aspect possibly bring quarantine exception mr finn i guess sixth circuit purported apply pike v bruce church test case and make argument was wrong test apply correct test apply applied wrong what youre arguing well whats matter you attack verbally explain think isnt consistent cases mr finn isnt really little unrealistic say dealing article commerce called garbage isnt article commerce landfill space isnt whats bought sold nobody wants garbage what want landfill space and isnt correct way look case but landfill space st clair county right now i suppose i suppose st clair county could impose enormous tax upon garbage brought landfill space it would result wouldnt yes course tax goes st clair countys coffers matter fact would deter st clair county using landfill it would deter everybody else using landfill thats precisely result well so youre making st clair county reduce business taxes impose enormous tax taking stuff landfill but extent county tried imposed tax citizens well i imagine wouldnt sit well told county going recoup money people live vote still get rid garbage dont and want reasonable rates i suppose let ask do think solid waste today commercial value part are things included solid waste today make potentially valuable item i dare say lots people would think werent laughter mr finn could michigan put together scheme whereby counties could decide wouldnt allow private landfills period waste disposal would countyowned sites and said outofstate waste i guess wouldnt win right mr finn i think cases said motive state appears protectionist parochial favoring local industry going give strict scrutiny what local industry think favored that is protectionist aspect its certainly good deal different lot cases weve but madison dean milk case case i think city madison trying assure particular local processing plant got business somewhere else wasnt yes but i dont see protectionist element case dean milk case theyre trying protect local business so new jerseyans end shipping garbage st clair county st clair county ends shipping garbage south dakota i mean spaces gone st clair county well i assume also means charge state today existing landfill charge state instate citizens incounty citizens lower doesnt i mean could accept material outofstate presumably price would go wouldnt well sounds like protectionism because threat garbage what county case combined embargo temporal limitation lets say 5 years 10 years justified assuming could ground takes long engage responsible planning construction facilities justified essentially basis planning purpose expressly overtly could no i mean classic sort case thats going apply question whether ought let foreign milk i mean either going consumed consumed market thats going take care but case i assume legitimate argument made cant effect create landfill overnight least reasonable people take measures prevent send garbage south dakota would take category heightened scrutiny b would reasonable basis balancing test allowing least temporal limitation well anywhere strictly soil sense you cant landfill anywhere choose it particular kind soil sort thing it sited away certain things very well mr casey is facial challenge act facial challenge act plus st clair implementation act what facially challenging the michigan so facial challenge whole michigan statute facial challenge michigan statute st clair ordinance implementing this garbage coming way connecticut michigan but i mean proposal bring garbage well state problem last case the state legislatures dont elect senators anymore thank mr finn the case submitted,1032.0,1548,24,mr chief justice may please court in 1905 california reduction company decision court said many questions involved municipal sanitation proved difficult solution 87 years later problems still us still difficult solution michigan attempted address difficult problems imposing comprehensive mandatory long range planning long range management process solid waste disposed county michigan petitioners claim commerce clause exempts even participating planning process petitioner asks court extend decision philadelphia v new jersey announce rule would require every county michigan presumably every county across nation absorb much outofcounty waste landfill operator wanted bring ability state local governments control volumes regardless local circumstances local consequences yes each county creates plan there 83 counties i believe eight currently permit importation outofstate waste the others currently contain specific provision permitting outofstate waste brought thats correct a state law requires affirmative action county outofstate waste brought correct there comprehensive process developing plan input local counties local planning agencies votes municipalities within county regional approval ultimately approval director department natural resources yes the solid we urging court case presents opportunity court reexamine philadelphia v new jersey decision in case court found solid waste article commerce found specific new jersey statute violated commerce clause as dissent case indicates argued brief amicus briefs unique characteristics solid waste present strong arguments solid waste considered within commerce clause if court we believe judgments affirmed without retreating whatsoever philadelphia v new jersey we believe however unique aspects solid waste problem urge court exert great deference reviewing state statute id like talk moment i would like mention outset narrow limited posture case court today in original complaint district court petitioner challenged statute face count 2 challenged statute applied st clair county count 3 alleged due process violations in court however abandoned everything except facial challenge they abandoned claim st clair countys refusal amend plan unconstitutional so sole challenge court whether comprehensive statewide statute unconstitutional merely permits county consider local circumstances deciding whether permit prohibit outofstate waste under petitioners view facial challenge county never prohibit outofstate waste regardless local circumstances local consequences our position state may implement planning process done permits counties take consideration local circumstances we would probably taking stronger position philadelphia v new jersey overruled we believe statute significantly different statute philadelphia v new jersey michigan michigan statute permit counties accept waste outofstate eight counties michigan also exports waste counties michigan in facial challenge would much like statute present philadelphia v new jersey if philadelphia v new jersey still good law statute michigan would the key differences statute statute philadelphia v new jersey case absolute prohibition our statute contain absolute prohibition our statute sets comprehensive planning process waste disposed county subjected identification sources estimation volumes key aspect michigan statute imposes county requirement guarantee future disposal capacity 20 years i would suggest that would analysis challenge statute applied particular circumstance what petitioner challenging mere fact state statute permits counties make local evaluation if county prohibited outofstate waste petitioner came challenged applied would commerce clause challenge would depend local circumstances we would get detailed factual dispute court maine v taylor extensive evidentiary record this case decided summary judgment virtually evidentiary record and postured case petitioner framed question presented petition facial challenge we submit question case state ever permit local units government evaluate local circumstances yes correct that question can state local circumstances ever justify county excluding outofstate waste that would position this subject matter fundamentally different typical economic under traditional commerce clause analysis determine nature legitimacy local concerns we submit case simply economic protectionism as court said sporhase decision perhaps i didnt understand example i understood hypothetical wanted exclude outofcounty residents using county that probably would sufficient justification making exclusion what look legitimacy local purpose what purpose clearly legitimate protection public health environment the key means state used implement legitimate purpose we believe means used statute reasonable they nondiscriminatory absolute statewide prohibition in limited facial challenge cannot said commerce clause absolutely requires every county michigan absorb waste without limitation volume sources outside county to extent landfills always pose dangers public health this michigan statute federal statutes best minimize danger always going danger the cases court applied strict scrutiny commerce clause area deal simple economic protectionism we dont we different there neighborhood 180 million tons year municipal solid waste generated it go somewhere statutes federal state level trying encourage types source separation recycling composting current practical reality going landfills foreseeable future landfills pose dangers wherever theyre located our position case michigan imposed county citizens extreme burden guaranteeing future capacity incounty waste taken burden therefore entitled commerce clause limit deciding service area public health dangers form leachate fluids seep landfill required pumped drained public health dangers methane gas produced pest animals insects noise because volume solid waste created throughout country measures taken somewhere provide proper disposal correct but traditional commerce clause analysis look nature legitimacy public purpose served you look legislative ends legislative means the goal minimize environmental damage minimize public health damage landfills st clair county could no we submit it would still pass muster either because facially discriminatory extent strict scrutiny cases applied standard i sure i understand the commerce clause analysis petitioner raised statute discriminatory favors incounty residents we submit look entire statute whole operates favor incounty residents in fact burdens incounty residents they permitted put waste trucks send someplace else they required guarantee next 20 years adequate landfill capacity take care solid waste generated within county but the point im i would analogize sporhase decision there statute regulating withdrawal transfer groundwater the state nebraska imposed restrictions instate transfers imposed different restrictions outofstate transfers that one factors court looked saying that portion statute facially discriminatory imposed burdens instate residents outofstate residents we submit principle applies significant burdens imposed incounty residents burden imposed outofcounty residents outofcounty waste participate planning process counties assumed burden disposing given ability limit service area in particular case county sufficient justification excluding outofcounty waste prohibition might unconstitutional applied we dont challenge case if burdens comparable statute we submit thats correct outofstate resident satisfy problem solid waste local problem its generated local level some localities solve problem putting trucks trains shipping away when michigan undertaken burden dispose waste submit commerce clause compel provide unlimited future landfill capacity rest country well no i dont think i dont think the commerce clause elevate free trade values where legitimate public health purposes statute protecting health hazards state undertaken address problems burdened duty provide future landfill capacity submit assuming burden therefore exercise control if every state law like michigans every county would required dispose solid waste would interstate problem they could receiving state accepted burden there nothing statute prohibits county accepting burdens the question commerce clause require accept burden already assuming burden guaranteeing again little way evidentiary record the record petitioner made request county amend plan permit 1750 tons per day outofcounty waste a staff county planning commission staff group looked concluded that amount additional waste would use capacity county planned within 6 years instead 20 and point no there litigation within state trying take outofcounty waste correct the fort gratiot landfill included within county plan the county plan estimates waste generated within county identifies sources estimates volumes they required assure proper disposal 20year period included fort gratiot landfill if could make showing challenge statute applied correct but challenge facts could succeed a similar challenge succeeded we cited dafter township opinion michigan court appeals precisely situation occurred the township sued landfill operator wanted bring outofcounty waste included county plan the landfill operator able demonstrate bringing additional amount would impair countys capacity therefore injunction denied the county would find alternative method assuring disposal that obligation no there obligations closing the county would still solve problem yes i dont know county could statute requires assure capacity correct correct the commerce clause would permit state michigan say landfills anywhere in proposal submitted said county said company said would guarantee full 20year capacity the staff looked proposal said there would 6 years would use thats fact dispute if pursued applied challenge could show st clair county impermissibly restricting outofstate waste protectionist purposes hoard limited capacity might succeed asapplied challenge but simple question thats court today county state michigan counties assumed burden taking care waste guaranteeing future capacity 20 years commerce clause require every county also assume burden disposing future much waste landfill operator wants bring we say in balancing local interests national interest free markets statute reasonable regulation it absolute prohibition it applies evenhandedly there four limited exceptions the governor whoever official passed regulation four exceptions court said in facial challenge saying permissible state statute let local governments evaluate local circumstances if local circumstances cannot accommodate outofstate waste commerce clause require county accept outofstate waste that would require challenge applied what facial challenge question state statute ever permit county evaluate local circumstances make decision based local circumstances local consequences if particular challenge made prohibition st clair countys might unconstitutional applied particular case facts narrow limited challenge simply cannot said michigan statute unreasonably impairs interstate commerce no the petitioner filed motions summary judgment the court denied entered judgments respondents counts but trial thats correct it summary judgment motion correct both district court court appeals applied pike test traditional application pike test found facial discrimination we reject petitioners characterization new principle espoused we submit in summary submit reasonable regulation unduly interfere interstate commerce permit protection public health if questions thank you,640.0,925,48,how i take state allows county however take outofstate waste and many counties plan permission and none rest and unless state law forbids importation so state law puts teeth arrangement and approval state yes mr casey state take position transportation solid waste presents significant health safety dangers is position taken state justify position well disagree leave precedents books well think state operates county hook you would making argument state law says solid waste outside state may may come state well case mr casey michigan statute name said eight counties shall able import waste others shall would make different case constitutional purposes it would much like sense like pennsylvania statute new jersey statute but distinction significant constitutional purposes difference fact state state decides whether county import garbage rather county but take responsibility counties authorization fact total prohibition respect counties and theyre state power total prohibition areas state in manner exclude outofstate garbage still receiving incounty garbage well suppose theres operator amusement park st clair county county state law like anybody county wants keep amusement prevent amusement parks catering outofstate visitors may well whats difference this amusement park operator wants business outofstate visitors state says well county keep county the county doesnt like traffic coming outofstate well neither would example they want exclude want prevent amusement park operator business people outofstate well we sense dont even posed issue us kinds interest kinds local interest would legitimate assert might reasonably asserted one maybe one described us concern public health and im sure exactly get beyond concern expressed i take dont take position impossible run landfill without threat public health all right well supposed kind get hands kind public health concern say least facially facial challenge might justify restriction i mean candid weve got kind slogan public health protect public health i dont know go get beyond no may articulate public health interest thats i want know i assume public health motivation i want sense pose case us i want sense legitimate concerns might therefore allowed possibility allowed prevail facial challenge what well seems raised two issued havent answered question the first issue decision state michigan impose burden citizens make somehow affect commerce clause analysis and number two still open question mind exactly public health hazards given present state solid waste technology consider least possible justifications response facial challenge so i still think youve got two questions why relevant michigan allocated responsibility way and number two leaving aside public health dangers supposed consider possibilities responding challenge those good arguments saying solid waste disposal sites desirable neighbors i mean well accept they may good arguments saying perfect world wouldnt but rise point clarity allow us consider deciding case but case unlike taylor maine case outofstate character item imported evil here evils described apply like measure instate outofstate garbage so im sure persuasive answer justice souters question asked specify us particular evil youre saying shear volume volume measured many ways instate outofstate discrimination is law subject strict scrutiny what and isnt subject strict scrutiny mr casey may i go back one questions left dangling do take position michigans allocation responsibility anyway relevant commerce clause analysis well began answer previous question mine saying somehow reasonable give counties kind leeway want give state allocated counties responsibility finding establishing i guess disposal sites least county wastes and i think thats telling and question isnt problem state michigan what got commerce clause analysis well dont care dont care discriminate county residents that you unfair like state citizens federal government doesnt care its youre unfair outofstate citizens thats issue it isnt enough impose burden intrastate state residents it burden doesnt i cant say well im taxing state residents i dont tax outofstate people therefore i know therefore i prevent outofstate people bringing garbage state but arent comparable how your county resident dispose trash county landfill the outofstate resident cant the commerce clause says theres thing local problem doesnt isnt basically commerce clause says mr casey point communities put garbage trains trucks ship away if every state united states law michigan would still possible and found could much cheaply putting train shipping area land cheap theres lot desert something wouldnt able would why does st clair county really want forbid private landfill operator processing disposing outofstate waste well hadnt operator taking outofstate waste this going new business so would new business landfill operator its still true i understand could demonstrate could still handle local garbage next 20 years law would still prohibit taking outofstate garbage no im im worrying constitutionality way would work if could demonstrate tremendous capacity could handle outofstate garbage local garbage next 50 years statute would still prohibit taking outofstate garbage well go ahead what would happen statute decided couldnt make profit without taking outofstate garbage decided close dump entirely what would county i see he obligation serve county next 20 years so rents space outofstate customer impact county closed the county still solve problem now i take agree mr finn county could simply prohibiting landfills going landfill business instance could prohibit outofstate receipt well theres comment would i assume agree would commerce clause bar otherwise political disposition state did landfill operator didnt offer didnt undertake satisfy countys of course wasnt absolute prohibition new jersey case either but whatever exceptions agency wanted allow allowed just county allow outofstate garbage wants its kind loophole want take advantage government wants take advantage the district court granted summary judgment respondents i mean petitioner so effect giving benefit resolving disputed facts i take and sixth circuit sent sixth circuit upheld thank mr casey mr finn 6 minutes

carolina supreme court cited extraneous feature post simmons amendment main thrust abolish parole cases murder hold simmons v south carolina apply south carolina secondly state argues even though simmons recognized due process right inform jury defendant ineligible parole arguments counsel instructions court never nevertheless somehow satisfy due process requirements simmons event finally state argues seizing single word culled opinions simmons word argue submits counsel rather self evidently desire evade avoid due process rule simmons declined drive home jury argument future dangerousness case presented jury therefore rule simmons triggered no no didnt i note yes the trial judge focused entirely word argue course came simmons simmons case state presented evidence penalty phase new evidence aggravation except i think indictments simmons prior record facts prior conduct come in guilt phase court simmons present veiled metaphorical argument majority court found raise issue rather indirectly excuse the prosecutor the prosecutor presented veiled metaphorical argument majority court found raised specter future dangerousness simmons case therefore occasion members court various opinions simmons referred rule simmons one involving triggered argument relative future dangerousness however points opinions court also used terms prosecution seeks demonstrate i think formulation yes in formulating because fact points justice oconnors opinion used term show future dangerousness state seeks show defendant would dangerous future it thats correct thats correct i think state court simply confused simmons required the south carolina procedure jury instructed determine first whether statutory aggravating circumstance shown this georgia type nonweighing statute finding aggravator threshold finding the jury instructed pursuant statute jury instructed jury unanimously find existence statutory aggravating factor goes it sentence it simply reports failure find aggravator judge judge sentences point judge option circumstances judge option either imposing 30calendaryear sentence life course without possibility parole they instructed 30year option none concern they simply told well thats correct thats jury needs know thats jurys job once jury finds aggravating factor jury becomes sentencer prior time dont need know parole they dont need know aggravation mitigation they dont need know anything thats thats exactly correct judge correctly told jury find aggravation become sentencer two alternatives death penalty life imprisonment this exactly situation simmons it cannot distinguished the difference the jury never acquires sentencing responsibility first place another option theres reason jury know its part job its part responsibility the state supreme court yesterday filed another case friend helpfully filed lodged court yesterday state v kelly court finally explained rationale state supreme court holding it said kelly another sentence life without parole available defendant alternative death penalty page 11 slip opinion simmons charge would actually mislead jury representing defendant would never released prison fact 30year sentence potential sentence defendant now clear happened this explanation doesnt appear shafer case accompanying starnes case apparently south carolina supreme court laboring misconception simmons instruction prediction jury defendants fate rather explanation sentencing option life imprisonment jury given of course simmons instruction latter it nothing prediction going happen defendant moment jury hasnt yet found aggravation in event none really matters the quite clear i think justice kennedys plurality opinion ramdass quoted brief indeed question presented cert petition three times stated holding simmons way precisely encompasses case he said parole eligibility instruction simmons required assuming jury fixes sentence life defendant ineligible parole state law simmons applies elsewhere opinion instances legal matter possibility parole jury decides appropriate sentence life imprisonment i go that holding simmons that holding clearly violated case according south carolina supreme court longer applies south carolina now clearly mistake made submit corrected this leaves question case the state asks remand case back south carolina supreme court perform rest simmons analysis we submit case fully briefed fully argued every aspect simmons surely south carolina supreme court thought future dangerousness placed issue case would gone constitutionally tenuous attempt reconsider first yes kelly i would said south carolina supreme court required word dangerousness actually used jury argument in kelly actually used word dangerousness apparently thats still enough i coming around saying i thought south carolina accept states argument dangerousness prong simmons kelly cast light certainly whole little saga leaves us i think leave court confidence time decide case whole aspect well lawyer tries cases trial court i think considerable merit view i dont endorse embrace behalf client theres need the rule simmons workable certainly enough warrant relief case when i stand corrected that ask now possible imagine cases raise future dangerousness we keep mind though nature south carolina statute especially difficult i agree draw line this open ended statute limitation nonstatutory evidence jury may consider weighing death side question once statutory aggravator found case entire penalty phase showing state consists wesley shafers prior convictions criminal sexual conduct

go far less protected restrictive environment society i mean would farcical argue well person dangerous prison let theres reason think wont fine the state supreme court i submit become due respect confused issue well certainly yes he say defense entitled simmons instruction seven members court joined opinions said simmons the which said simmons instruction given course state may still show justice oconnors plurality opinion made point justice oconnors concurrence plurality opinion the state may still show nevertheless dangerous prison everything must come there warrant whatsoever saying someone dangerous kill prison yet pretend though jury going draw inevitable common sense conclusion hes dangerous prison concrete bars around also dangerous hes released parole theres doubt that exactly point fact even supervision explosively angry jailer slam door cell door constrain rage telephone cut well holding simmons simmons would stand strange proposition state entitled prove future dangerousness call witness witness indeed thats states pretrial notice described evidence evidence future dangerousness laughter thats okay no in fact argument almost run course entire nation by count 37 states policy statute rule court decision issue 35 tell jury law parole release cases parole release the states simmons application i include south carolina although state supreme court says almost none pennsylvania south carolina pennsylvania pennsylvania supreme court divided 4 3 whether give simmons instruction every case arguable distinction pennsylvania apply south carolina way distinguishing two states pennsylvania aggravation limited this court knows statute blystone v pennsylvania only designated statutory aggravating factors may considered reasons impose death penalty future dangerousness one theory nowhere jury give aggravating weight likely dangerous behavior defendant nevertheless argument made state supreme court required simmons instruction given that entire roster states dont tell jury whats going happen spare mans life i say issue debate really intents purposes virtually except south carolina now part i think part proof depend jurys questions jurys questions really remind us really encountered pretty serious problem the jury ask why would asked parole fact found aggravating circumstance turned sentencing responsibility worried whether going get dangerous parole relevant future dangerousness probably happening the prosecutors evidence case dangerousness resonate jury entirely expected as i getting ready say if actual formal argument statutory allegation required trigger rule simmons would entirely right prosecution everything could evidence no no we one two states governor clemency power death sentence he cannot reduce airtight system mind man devise life without parole south carolina means there statutory provision terms requires extraordinary circumstances in simmons court noted yes course but thats instruction asked the instruction asked statutory language parole yes you decided california v ramos thats no it never passed a peculiar problem argue law must guide jury like ice likely melt next summer effervesce away leaves jury rather brutal fact death permanent well know general proposition states enjoy broad discretion california v ramos tell sorts things like jury case depend exact outer limitation well thats correct thats correct of course could of course simmons argument rebuttal it argument dont allege prosecutorial misconduct we allege right tell side story let prosecutor tell side theyve got tell didnt get important fact jury 19yearold wesley shafer if neither argumentation evidence presented state well really isnt you know capital case tried one courtroom union county south carolina case state south carolina v susan smith now paradigmatic example case future dangerousness issue and drowned children right now rare cases family murders example situational murders like circumstances certain never recur implicate future dangerousness if no i think either i dont think jurys question i think question another day i think good argument could made entitled it argument need make reason case jury probably asked state proved future dangerousness least took pretty good run said going pretrial notice they good word no your honor as matter fact counsel requested right read statute jury the state opposed argument judge ordered result left various metaphors term life imprisonment terms i mean analyze closely no dont course argument statute jury instructions defense counsel i think properly court indicated wouldnt give charge counsel said well i would least like read jury course simmons says another way take care problem statute prosecution said educate jury parole cant either judge sustained states position said nothing parole jury clearly noticed omission well court case seven members court said encompassed within simmons rule thats way addressed case no we make a separate assignment error if i may your honor i would like reserve remainder time thank your honor justice oconnor asked whether prosecutor judges power give instruction whether simmons seen require in record case excerpt subsequent case tried trial judge judge hayes state v robertson added record lower court argument prosecutors adjoining county made judge hayes ruled would give instruction stated bothered ever since shafer case shafer decision state supreme court area considerable discretion fact prosecutors didnt make issue instruction often given but south carolina supreme court made quite clear except rare cases involving recidivist statute thats almost never invoked life without parole section statute never given unless court rules otherwise simmons case the last thing i want say near unanimity states issue really demonstrate i think paradigmatic example due process violation considered judgments american people claim expressed courts legislatures already quite quite clear now i thought simmons also clear due process clause required clearly south carolina clear enough i would hope court decide issues presented record whether south carolina supreme court reached i think theres need another analysis went kelly case your honor i impression i looking joint appendix right i recall mr banks defense counsel saying wanted read jury i cant put finger right if i may i file letter clerk giving citation fact recollection correct and reasons hope court take issues presented case reverse death sentence imposed the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,588.0,822,22,well hear argument next number 005250 shafer v south carolina well wait minute mr bruck well court appeals decision really reach issue whether future dangerousness argued i think trial judge thought prosecutor fact made argument you said court presented veiled metaphorical argument the prosecutor yes well justice oconnors opinion case two rest us joined say one conditions simmons prosecution argued defendant pose threat society future why shouldnt take holding case well even thought future dangerousness must argued put shown supreme court south carolina didnt reach question so really left looking i suppose whether sentencing option trial judge would jury find aggravating circumstance would trigger simmons would i right observe maybe right did jury know case third option instructed effect so far jury knew determining life imprisonment however might define capital punishment and 30year alternative doesnt exist aggravating circumstances found well yesterdays the go ahead yesterdays case williams  kelly kelly case indicate south carolina supreme court takes formal view issue future dangerousness there seems argumentation prosecution really much geared towards future dangerousness even even case supreme court south carolina thought that issue submitted jury way trigger simmons instruction do associate position taken friend side inevitably capital murder case future dangerousness present factor isnt case case thing jury every case determining whether going death rather life mr bruck said state asks us remand as i understand brief first ask us affirm say court decides reverse it remanded it future dangerousness general public i mean one assumes brutal murderer going dangerous prison setting as i understand simmons reason relevant jury know whether person paroled jury worried danger general public hell danger inmates prison whether hes going paroled dont establish argued future dangerousness general public so youre saying prosecutor cannot argue know death penalty adequate remedy person brutal murderer he killed prison there assurance put prison kill prison youre saying prosecutor makes argument simmons triggered obviously hes going dangerous prison hes going dangerous prison although prosecutor make point but youre saying cant say hes going dangerous prison which said well doesnt necessarily follow far i see i mean prison much restrictive environment person prone dangerousness might well confine prison constant supervision he gets isnt supervision might behave differently this argument proves much i mean washes simmons requirement argued future dangerousness i mean suppose prosecution shows course trial never argues dangerousness shows person mean nasty temper uncontrollable many instances killing many many people you could make argument youre making obvious jury persons going dangerous let therefore simmons instruction given i dont think thats said simmons i think simmons required dangerousness argued if argued then i dissented course i think stands strange proposition can tell i dont want take far away case in states apply simmons almost matter course many refrain giving instruction future dangerousness argued well mr bruck suppose i take governor south carolina power pardon that statute amended i presume right you cant really tell jury never get jail well supposing state governor power pardon court says want give want give simmons instruction could state say well addition please say governor authority pardon defendant so okay in cases lets say simmons instruction given prosecution stand say well ladies gentlemen jury true theres life parole know legislatures change things 10 years defendant may get would proper argumentation has ever passed that isnt law must guide jury that law isnt directed jury its directed prison authorities jury really wants know whether person going danger general public seems to advise you know right thats statute reads theres great anti capital punishment movement abroad many people think weve harsh may amended whats wrong want jury know real state affairs but youre asking jury instruction jury instruction law it politics isnt point but couldnt prosecutor least argue youre going make argument least argue jury person animal try get bust prison maybe history jail break person couldnt prosecutor bring do i understand argument correctly think simmons would apply even argumentation future dangerousness long jury posed question came judge said know get life prison mean life prison as i understood said little bit earlier think that alone would trigger simmons argumentation future dangerousness theres always evidence guys dangerous hes killed somebody she one drove lake all normal murder cases arent family murder cases think jury asks youre entitled simmons instruction do think simmons said mr bruck said moment ago didnt chance get side argument jury certainly defense counsel could stated jury hell never get prison alternative life without parole well saying south carolina submit advance arguments side well thats different problem thats problem youre complaining i mean may well violation let counsel argue whether state let counsel argue quite different question whether state must require judge instruct jury concerning was part assignment error counsel allowed read statute okay that might well problem very well mr bruck mr zelenka well hear mr bruck know answer question asked i impression defense counsel asked allowed say told couldnt say thank mr bruck the case submitted,1045.0,1481,26,mr chief justice may please court in 1994 decision simmons v south carolina justice oconnor concurring opinion stated state puts defendants future dangerousness issue alternative sentence death life imprisonment without possibility parole due process entitles defendant inform capital jury either argument instruction parole ineligible for three separate reasons submit south carolina trial judge 1998 violate due process mandates court simmons failing specifically instruct jury petitioner parole ineligible were asserting south carolina formal statutory aggravating factor future dangerousness it allows admission evidence concerning defendants character fact thats correct based upon argument evidence issue future dangerousness society would necessary particular case for reasons weve set forth brief think south carolina supreme court appropriately followed mandates simmons making determinations simmons apply time thats correct it appear reach question whether future dangerousness yes i thats correct they told situation they told find aggravating factor stop we believe south carolina supreme court correctly decided case jury instructions given jury arguments made another option available sentencing option 30year sentence because question whether statutory aggravating circumstance existed factor would make determination whether 30yearwithoutparole option available decided jury particular time facing decision thats correct okay well think faced false dilemma court concerned simmons potential fact would released prison the jury know anything it still faced situation decision create false dilemma fact would available released society based upon determination jury made determination whether fact aggravating factor existed at time question asked time jury making determinations aggravating factor found fact still available sentenced released prison im aware particular number i apologize knowing your honor i could say those cases generally would brought particular attention the statute became effective january 1996 there time option the existence statutory aggravating factor course one fact whether jury finds beyond reasonable doubt existence depends upon matter proof goes judge there sentencing option now whether done based upon jurys failure find statutory aggravating factor another reason unclear it may guilty plea situation sentenced beyond 30year mandatory minimum sentence 40 50 years i aware situations what im its i true understanding whether jury find factors whether guilty plea situation judge find factors bench trial i know sentences 30year mandatory minimum sentence thats correct its position weve stated finding statutory aggravating factor ministerial act time jury enters verdict fact potential release society still false dilemma they know anything advised actual answer particularly question would advised yes option available release 30year mandatory minimum sentence would cause possibly available release time deliberations going yes would correct that would consistent courts decision simmons case for second reason submit future dangerousness presented case simmons fact triggered we agree theres nothing particular statute i see would prevented situation occurring i dont know would set forth it may require statutory change theres nothing statute necessarily would prevented situation occurring it asked case im aware asked cases gone south carolina supreme court would three cases shafer case starnes case kelly case decided yesterday with respect second issue submit south carolina supreme court expressly decide future dangerousness additional sustaining grounds simmons apply situation future dangerousness neither presented evidence argued particular situation prosecutor union county particularly court determined state argues future dangerousness urges jury sentence individual death longer threat society that presentation made particular case prosecution in fact time prior determination sentencing instructions trial judge conceded future dangerousness presented case the prosecutor recognizing ability simmons option argue future dangerousness would bring parole issue jury chose expressly stated court going i think petitioners assertion taken somewhat context in phrase might come back raised time crime individuals came upon crime scene it part videotape describing crime there nothing particular statement directed towards defendant future threat society what he repeated argument circumstances crime victims came upon crime victims witnesses came upon crime scene particular situation followed utilizing phrase might come back directed towards defendant may come back directed towards individuals may come counties south carolina it argument specific deterrence defendant general deterrence society whole make determination death sentence case based upon facts circumstances crime circumstances defendant would appropriate well part i mean victims said time crime the emotional trauma thats correct no phrased there nothing as argument crime general as argument allowing individual individuals come state south carolina commit acts fairly punished that statement argument specific excuse general deterrence criminals coming state punished we think it circumstance crime expressing people came upon crime scenes immediate fear saw brutal slaying mr broome thats expression it recognition almost extent fact victims it victims impact statement phrase exact exactly occurred time they testified occurred think that fair comment it comment upon future dangerousness similarly submit presentation evidence presented penalty phase trial concerning prior records go future dangerousness that goes simply character defendant theres nothing utilized records show fact would propensity commit crime future there representation fact suggested would future threat what asking sentence retribution fact individual based upon unique character deserved death sentence it question i think recognize language justice oconnors statement say future dangerousness argued parole eligibility become issue jury cognizant particular situation theyre making tactical decision realizing benefits concerns would what theyre understand try raise issue may due process concerns well i think i think first weve asserted third argument statute initially given told three occasions life imprisonment means death offender life imprisonment means incarceration death offender the concern i understand south carolina supreme court believe following courts mandate california v ramos believes policy fact jurys attention directed towards characteristics defendant circumstances crime potential release mechanisms may exist also well trial judge make determination consistent law decisions south carolina supreme court held the prosecutor could said the judge would bound prosecutors statement the trial judge would bound follow decisions south carolina supreme court consistently said parole eligibility appropriate factor jurors consideration way implicitly said collateral matters potential release appropriate matters thats correct the prosecutor may willing defense counsel may willing trial judge necessarily would decision supreme court expressly says supposed given except future dangerousness argued that land law time yes pennsylvania would directly affected the cases cite pennsylvania look whether argument future dangerousness given theyve determined arguments evidence future dangerousness given aggravating factor defendant prior history violent crimes prior record presented they look way submit south carolina supreme court looking whether fact future dangerousness in fact i believe pennsylvania supreme court says future dangerousness specifically pointed jury argument fact come pennsylvania would also directly affected whether future dangerousness well i think state interest basically supreme court south carolina wants jurors focus particular characteristics defendant particular circumstances crime concerned potential collateral matters potential release may divert attentions speculative issue may fact ever occur fact life prison would get jury sentence whether parole eligible may fact unique characteristics defendant much life sentence whether theres parole eligibility would serve entire time prison again addressing one questions existence pardon pardon exists south carolina its hands governor its hands south carolina department probation parole they make determination also exist soon conviction entered inmate south carolina i think thats state interest concerned going collateral matters fact issues may weigh upon jurors decision may fact exactly happens parole board may would never parole there may parole board always paroles theres theyre elected every 4 years essentially south carolina may change every 4 years cant predict situation would arise pardon change law we submit instructions given case adequately complied south carolina law further also submit fact occurred case seen satisfy simmons i said jury instructed three occasions life imprisonment fact means death offender life imprisonment fact means incarceration death offender that they thats correct well take position plain life imprisonment means death offender fact means imprisonment death offender reasonable juries think understand well consistent south carolina law said parole eligibility ineligibility consideration followed language life imprisonment means death offender we think juror understood mean fact prison forever because south carolina law required state v southerland limit way answer made judge complying south carolina law mandate also jury appear confused consistent courts opinion weeks v angelone theyre presumed follow oath instructions come back ask question received information the defense counsel prevented making argument defendant fact would serve life prison jail in fact clear information defense counsel made stated set forth page 39 40 brief question state execute die prison we ask able spend natural life life prison death wesley shafer going prison staying thats correct he asked that read part instruction authorized happen the judge made determination that shouldnt presented thats correct no i dont recall occurring within particular record it may understanding seeking fact judge make instruction time outset case that language given now judge made instruction yes i i know earlier motion limine made prosecution able say defendant prison rest life that removed based upon way instructions ended coming fact defense counsel page 198 said say give life hes going home child spend rest life prison send 19yearold prison rest life argument made we submit due process particular case satisfied there false dilemma presented either facts circumstances law defined particular case would request conviction death sentence wesley shafer affirmed,598.0,856,28,well want us interpret concurring opinion simmons formal submission aggravating factor future dangerousness basis triggering simmons requirement there i think theres language concurring opinion goes somewhat it says prosecutors often emphasize defendants future dangerousness evidence argumentation sentencing phase thats formal future dangerousness sense statutory aggravating factor i understand talking argumentation thats made sentencing phase well supreme court i read opinion really rested holding new sentencing option trial judge 30 years event jury find aggravating factor and really didnt reach question whether future dangerousness argued presented no going talk ground supreme court rested and seemed time jury instructed given instruction could told found aggravating circumstance options life imprisonment death right and jury told might happen sentencing trial judge dont find aggravating circumstance well i would think simmons would apply jury instruction stage assuming future dangerousness case that option available jury it nothing jury told function i dont understand simmons would apply assuming future dangerousness issue well thats jury decide if found aggravating factor options life imprisonment death jury sent around questions saying mean life imprisonment and i would thought simmons would triggered despite fact found aggravating circumstance something else would it potential jury i dont understand argument it potential jury knew anything mr zelenka matter curiosity since new option came judge alone jury capital murder trials south carolina many occasions jury failed find aggravator judge would sentencing 30year mandatory minimum have and long force judge option 30 years so would time im clear answer have cases capital murder cases jury failed find aggravator charged could find oh guilty plea yes right which could come guilty plea okay well i think youre right metaphysical matter moment time like ramdass there two options open but functional standpoint jury didnt know anything thats simmons directed well i suppose would agree trifurcation jury first found aggravating factor came back simmons instruction would given future dangerousness going before get could defense attorney say judge i want bifurcate first tell jury come say whether find aggravator would set defense get simmons charge has asked case i thought prosecutor argued victim somebody store kept saying might come back might come back tells jury remember remember might come back might come back presented quite lot evidence person committed crimes hed even committed crimes custody didnt show remorse i mean whats telling jury it sounds jury might conclude that hes worried might come back including man i thought repeated argument didnt of course wouldnt care came back werent going dangerous got back would no im addressing im addressing point argument said concerned prosecutor concerned persons defendant might come county and suggestion i dont suppose would relevant unless persons came county would dangerous thats true sounds like future dangerousness argument would apply people person isnt well i know wasnt phrased like what im suggesting thats reasonable tendency argument how else would taken well say really etched mind really etched mind monica picking phone saying hurry might come back might come back i wondered said it happened circumstance would fair infer record i read kelly case thats submitted prosecutors state sometimes little careful arguing future dangerousness simmons instruction triggered as tactical decision that seems to well seems to indicate theres strong reason simmons instructions given affect jurys going well whats matter telling sentencer statutory scheme why problem why tell statute says it three lines three four sentences i dont understand well werent read one two sentences strictly follow statute it takes 30 seconds read it prosecutors decision i mean prosecutor given instruction supreme court wasnt going somehow revoke i mean prosecutor wasnt whether agree allow statute read but prosecutor said judge perfectly willing statute read would okay wouldnt i suppose prosecutor said i objection giving simmons instruction would necessarily meant would given trial judge felt consistent rulings south carolina supreme court court mr zelenka state know states relying upon language simmons said future dangerousness argued i mean suppose changed case said oh foo doesnt matter whether argued state would judgments conviction death penalty overturned your opponent tells us south carolina pennsylvania two states sort rear guard giving simmons instruction just fair opportunity would tell states interest thats really served refusing give instruction states seem think pretty ordinary i suppose state could game system couldnt providing parole eligibility even life imprisonment sentence appointing parole commission tough never gives parole then jury would instructed unless condemn person death theres possibility hell paroled although fact possibilitys realistic but jury asks i mean obviously jury thought ambiguous asked judge effect mean and judge read statute point life imprisonment means death offender right and didnt go rest statute would made plain meant but judge couples statement dont worry parole thats none business implication thing but thats case would harmless give would harmless give additional sentence reading correct why read sentence remove doubt but case defense attorney asked could read rest statute including starting person sentenced life prison eligible parole he wanted read allowed not judge defense counsel i understood colleague instruction refused effort defense counsel read statute part closing argument refused can check record tell us thats case not right time left advise us subsequently thank mr

Maryland,129 ORIG,1065502800.0,1070949600.0,Virginia,Maryland,,,0,1068.0,1984,27,mr chief justice may please court the special master correctly decided regulation issue two reasons first language compacts question plain unambiguous second 180 years maryland never disputed entirely the plain language article iv blackjenkins award uses term riparian ownership its that thats correct but think plain language we think thats thats correct enabling legislation blackjenkins award provided neither states would deprived rights privileges would citizens deprived rights privileges compact 1785 your honor citizens virginia rights compact virginia sovereign entered interstate compact maryland secondly maryland recognized enabling legislation provided blackjenkins award rights rights citizens states that language used enabling act yes thats correct i think thats correct if look opinion accompanied blackjenkins award arbitrators said virginia proven use potomac river since earliest days rights therefore indisputable maryland assented virginias use signed compact 1785 now compact your honor entered time boundary disputed regardless boundary set i think mr baida admits recognized that compact set boundary state agreed wherever boundary ultimately would set citizens state states would certain rights rights included right property shores advantages emoluments thereunto belonging privilege making carrying wharfs improvements i dont think thats correct your honor article yes well blackjenkins award clearly deals virginia state the compact deals virginia state article viii example requires neither state could regulate fishing navigation without concurrence state articles x xi xii also deal rights citizens wherever compact involved matter state would touch activities citizens state said expressly and inconceivable think the drafters compact would agreed concurrent legislation would required fishing navigation maryland could somehow regulate virginias right build improvements shore its inconceivable would ratified compact required thats correct your honor article viii requires concurrent legislation fishing navigation rules potomac river thats correct your honor 1957 states concurrent legislation governing fishing potomac river in 1957 based article viii compact in 1957 maryland attempted abrogate requirement assume unilateral authority potomac river virginia filed suit this court appointed special master hear case the states resolved dispute tidal potomac creation potomac river fisheries commission bistate agency regulates fishing in tidal potomac as nontidal potomac since 1957 state laws books recognize permits issued licenses issued citizens state valid licenses fishing nontidal potomac the permit justice oconnor issued fairfax county water authority no your honor contend permit required first instance also challenged specific permit maryland legislature required contain condition requiring water authority put flow restrictor pipeline sole purpose maryland legislature said allowing maryland control growth development northern virginia we object the authority objected subject outcome case we object thats correct thats correct and thats exactly right i dont mean say answer limited fairfax county water authority we object continuation maryland permit system requires virginia get marylands permission anytime want withdraw water potomac river build improvements appurtenant shore i dont believe that would riparian right your honor with respect potomac river theres low flow allocation agreement place congress required allocates flows periods low flow there water coordination agreement 1982 place three main utilities district columbia agreed provide future water supply this court said colorado no we dont believe right not low flow agreement water supply coordination agreement absolutely yes mr chief justice this court said colorado v new mexico court enjoin state diverting water potomac river state im sorry that vermejo river this court requires showing diversion would cause clear clear convincing evidence diversion would cause injury state seeking prevent diversion in case maryland circumvented requirement controlling tap maryland doesnt contend anything virginia done date injures river there would many places raise issue virginia prevails case they raise context federal virginia permitting requirements 404 section 10 permitting requirements if maryland claim virginias withdrawals injure it place raise claim it could it could army corps engineers permitting process federal common law would govern court said colorado v new mexico the fact that river colorado didnt give colorado right withdraw water river yes your honor thats correct theyre coequal sovereigns contending interstate river supplies water citizens of states under view case compact gave citizen right subject federal regulations subject virginia regulation and maryland contend either permitting process independently action virginia citizen that show causes injury maryland shouldnt allowed but the master ruled compact award virginia citizens right withdraw water construct improvements appurtenant shore without get permission maryland yes no your honor the primary place disputes decided practical matter federal permitting process its much like thenassociate justice rehnquist wrote court milwaukee v illinois federal permitting process a federal water pollution control act case federal permitting process provides adequate forum state raise concerns thats exactly right thats correct yes i think key evidence let move beyond think is plain language and discuss also master looked respect marylands practice historically the key evidence comes 1873 this time maryland virginia trying settle boundary dispute in boundary arbitration maryland contended boundary line virginia side lowwater mark go around improvements existing quote may hereafter extended authority virginia unquote thats page 130 virginia lodging in maryland view 1873 view maintained arbitration entirely virginia decide whether build improvements shore and actually thought would alter boundary line i think your honor courts equitable apportionment cases recognize state sovereign interest protecting water supply citizens water supply served interstate river most cases justice kennedy cases involve river goes one state another state dont thats right article iv blackjenkins your honor article iv blackjenkins award says virginia right use river beyond line lowwater mark may necessary full enjoyment riparian ownership and maryland stipulated absolutely it absolutely this courts federal common law cases distinguish rights states respect water supply rights individual citizens i dont think colorado v new mexico good example the pecos river 75 percent came colorado flowed new mexico but court effectively denied colorado use river regardless fact owned river ownership dispositive in dispute states a water supply supplies citizens states now potomac river interstate river the congress recognized 1976 required waters allocated a drop water begins shenandoah virginia drop water anymore maryland drop water main stem potomac we think least coextensive compact i i dont i think that position would defensible go beyond your honor words give maryland right action cause action virginia user use interferes marylands use river that doesnt mean maryland gets decide no state control another states access water supply state party dispute and fairly decide dispute no your honor rely on the plain language compact blackjenkins award clearly give virginia right use my understanding justice kennedys question whether theres distinction riparian rights of riparian users private users rights states riparians and i answering question yes difference court repeatedly said the civil law riparian users bind states respect use interstate stream that question i i answering thats correct it virginia right regulate citizens use river it many years local building permit requirement cant build a pier wharf virginia side even though goes beyond lowwater mark without getting a building permit from county virginia enacted thats correct and virginia enacted subject resolution case virginia water permit protection requirement applicable virginia users river so if virginia prevails case maryland regulate users river virginia regulate users river he would get authority virginia the construction your honor the pier appurtenant property virginia shore thats correct i think distinguish uses riparian uses riparian 99 percent everything thats ever built that would riparian use operating casino pier would riparian use thats virginia objected wide variety activities maryland side line dont go whether virginia right build riparian structure first place article vii article iv blackjenkins award thats correct well may uses in gray whether riparian use let heres im sure question would answered let tell guiding principles would most uses states going agree riparian uses traditional things bulkheads piers wharfs docks water intakes master found there number uses well agree nonriparian building casino middle river if theres gray area and weve got argument riparian maryland argument issue may litigated cant resolve but thats framework i think answers questions now thats thats exactly right justice ginsburg maryland boundary set the virginia lowwater mark 1877 virginia doesnt dispute maryland acquired wide range police powers side boundary specifically apply rights virginia citizens enjoyed compact 1785 preserved condition blackjenkins award maryland historically least 1957 recognized entirely virginia decide virginias shore your honor something like 340 piers extending virginia side potomac river all taxed by virginia only three properties taxed maryland unique theyre restaurant properties sited property thats fee simple title recorded maryland those maryland side line so virginia taxes 99 percent improvements maryland argued that court look taxation three restaurant properties we think that exception proves rule maryland doesnt tax 99 percent everything virginia ever built the maryland construction 1873 entirely virginia decide whether build improvements remained construction earliest 1957 and 1957 first permit issued virginia user fairfax county record undisputed that permit known virginia state officials it refers advantages emoluments right the article vii refers advantages emoluments ownership land thats thats exactly right but answer question your honor need article vii address specific question everybody would assumed state retained authority regulate citizens but your honor thinking would inconceivable george mason who negotiated compact behalf virginia opposed federal constitution gave congress much authority over commerce would signed agreement understanding maryland authority decide virginia could make use river thats history way thats marylands argument always every stick bundle sticks historically thats case prior subsequent grants virginia included potomac river five monarchs disputed marylands claim and issue controverse court twice said morris v united states marine railway agreed 1785 bundle sticks two states agreed regardless boundary would set state would equal sticks bundle representing right equal access river agreed condition award sticks bundle would never deprived either state and maryland didnt authority take away regulate virginias rights prior 1877 could gained authority blackjenkins award part question your honor goes goes whether boundary historic lowwater mark mean lowwater mark and i dont think court answered question may require resolution future but this court determined ohio v kentucky lowwater mark 1792 again i think going depend whether historic low mean low answer question i think answer question and long doesnt interfere marylands use maryland remedy it object permitting process it file original action it could sue virginia user making use water the issue though whether maryland gets decide first instance virginias rights court never given one state authority control another states water supply thats right it true virginians withdraw water subject paramount federal control subject virginias control they withdraw water subject virginias control thats correct your honor but court said number cases including new york new jersey v new york connecticut v massachusetts common law limitation may limit shoreline use riparian use would apply states and article vii article iv blackjenkins award refers virginias rights sovereign use potomac well it doesnt use word sovereign i dont i fail see distinction award in opinion arbitrators talking virginia commonwealth state not virginia as mere property owner well issue withdrawing water whether thats riparian use has stipulated the master said page 12 report maryland never disputed riparian use use covered compact so thats issue thats correct i i agree justice scalia id like correct one misstatement i think friend mr baida made respect low flow allocation agreement that agreement the enabling legislation provided amended make clear maryland authority control virginias withdrawals that issue put aside another day low flow allocation agreement example says party withdraw water potomac river without subject permit imposes low flow conditions becoming member party agreement and point papers numerous instances 1970s virginia went record saying maryland authority regulate virginias water withdrawals whether look case the compacts question federal common law cannot give one state authority control another states water supply this case important virginias rights build wharfs improvements its important maryland prevails control growth development in virginia under mr baidas theory long treat everybody equally anything want would include things like 2001 legislation maryland general assembly would made users the waters pay water withdrawal maryland could decide doesnt like growth development either side river therefore treating state equally allowing use its impossible square type position plain language article iv award article vii compact and questions thank much,708.0,1102,53,does plain language tell us riparian rights but said plain language compact youre sudden talking blackjenkins the compact use word riparian so say plain language compact gloss blackjenkins award what make i dont front maybe i im missing something but i thought blackjenkins award also put included disclaimer wasnt fact modifying anything 1785 compact am i right how im sorry assuming get language article vii compact refers citizens language blackjenkins talks states so you say interpreting blackjenkins award virginias riparian ownership is defined part sovereign status so sovereignty inherent ownership except sense document least compact i read state treated like owner well point something compacts the blackjenkins award contrary why concurrent fishing article seventh says the citizens states right fishing river shall common equally enjoyed citizens states for preservation fish performance preserving keeping open channel has virginia issued virginia fishing license valid in potomac whats left dispute is virginia permit withdraw water yes is youre arguing so were talking flow restrictor pipe i mean thats comes well virginia objects general principle i take idea maryland restrict amount water takes of potomac but general right riparian owner river withdraw water would say right includes right withdraw unlimited quantity water well decides limit can imposed riparian owners right withdraw water but assume agreements riparian question thats controlled documents assume agreements would maryland right say x amount water may withdrawn riparian owner maryland virginia could drain river no but lets assume none weve original jurisdiction cases decided amounts water in fact texas new mexico case theres theres river master pecos river operating one decrees well werent talking potomac river no i mean your if contend could enforce contention im trying trying original jurisdiction case involving fight two states and assume nobody made agreements determining ownership river would maryland right to limit amount virginia could withdraw and thats thats now well lets lets forget findings im trying put assuming one one side agreements brand new problem maryland virginia fighting control withdrawals water river and principle that says someone owner river make decision well virginia would claim maryland maryland took much water and thats federal common law two states involved all right let what citizen virginia owns property lowwater mark river wants build dock pier extends river does citizen get permission maryland is special master specifically held view what maryland takes position obstructs navigation whos going decide virginia because navigable river federal government scheme place but if i i take answer would in federal question suit brought maryland virginia citizen could answer question and part im going back ground weve traversing already what in documents us i mean compact blackjenkins agreement number one law generally number two gives virginia special rights sovereign withdraw water people opposed right would simply owner of property withdrawal rights property owns but cases correct im wrong state owns to centerline river correct im wrong yes state interest river but virginia owns to lowwater mark and i want show tell something documents says virginia special right special rights sovereign i know virginia party but her riparian ownership give rights different greater private owner land and source and support proposition but cases states ownership interest equal ownership interest river and riparian ownership i think i think least would concede would blackjenkins agreement goes step beyond the compact regard well isnt but isnt limiting extent there something fourth article black 1877 arbitration award refers without without impeding navigation thats throughout otherwise interfering proper use maryland what would words suggest maryland permit use assure proper use interfered but depending referred federal common law words compact words of the blackjenkins but i i thought justice kennedy pressed ultimately rested federal common law mr raphael position i believe private landowner riparian owner virginia side southern shore wants build pier river pier would permitted virginia why you see i understand authority maryland permit since maryland owns river bed what authority virginia demand permit riparian owners because state riparian sovereignty state sovereignty bank but theres a pier going river thats 5 years owner wants modify wants build something end pier from would get authority but thats state maryland the end pier im talking the pier part virginia yes pier located state maryland then wouldnt get authority make modification state maryland i guess enforce gaming laws whatever maryland police ones jurisdiction arent well repairing end pier riparian use nonriparian and answer i take you rest article vii 1785 compact yes what operating fishing pier charging who would authority tax fishing pier is riparian use riparian yes i tried pick one is special master said gambling safety rules health tax licensing irrelevant case does maryland virginia tax the value a major pier goes river i mean worth something i assume theres tax anything thats worth anything taxed in compact beginning article clause viii theres particular assignments sovereign powers abrogation sovereign power doesnt apply vii and seems that helps maryland case when compact wanted provide virginia would specific police powers provided it didnt provide respect riparian rights in fact doesnt even mention riparian rights it talks wharfs referring compact but doesnt use word riparian well im im sure if three four provisions contract compact specific abrogations assignment sovereignty one doesnt i i would assume that provision made well hes operating baseline maryland owns river yes seems matter sort looking history time documents negotiated prepared i dont think anyone contemplated possibility diversion water river would great might lower lowwater mark and view that virginia could syphon enough water reduce move lowwater mark say foot obstruct navigation clearly couldnt take much but could change state boundary state i see i dont know youd know historic lowwater mark we kind stuff laughter you would say assuming assume a understanding border fixed border could virginia change drawing withdrawing water view but say even might change boundary state could withdraw much water want long doesnt interfere transportation river well generally riparian owners the right withdraw water subject overriding control governmental body controls the lake river whatever but youre saying thats true but subject control owner river but riparian ownership usually contemplates beneficial use waters riparian land general withdrawal inland uses strictly speaking no doesnt say sovereign it says virginia it say sovereign this important im right of course use word well talking virginia right regulate question whether talking virginia sovereign withdraws water i think fair say article fourth acknowledges virginia might call riparian sovereign it sovereign rights over bank river it says entitled full dominion soil lowwater mark blah blah blah blah use river beyond line low may necessary full enjoyment riparian ownership and i think thats referring sovereign ownership thank mr raphael mr baida 3 minutes remaining,913.0,1324,39,thank mr chief justice may please court there two reasons state maryland authority regulate virginia citizens seek place structures withdraw water potomac river first confirmed blackjenkins award 1877 courts decision morris v united states state maryland owner potomac river since 1632 maryland never correct maryland owner river never relinquished sovereign authority title river gives regulate takes place bed and second reason its privilege making carrying orders justice oconnor although privilege would seem apply building something river exercise riparian right riparian right withdraw water no justice oconnor we never taken position that virginia riparian rights respect potomac river correct correct correct subject standard reasonableness justice oconnor its no its assessed fact maryland owns river virginia as riparian owner rights respect river maryland must reasonable respect regulations thats precisely correct and and the river justice scalia entirely within state maryland undisputed the language maryland charter back 1632 the entire river maryland marylands ownership potomac gives right gives right regulate takes place bed there riparian rights court recognized riparian rights always subject government regulation there its yes its the right build potomac compact yes the objection simply maryland right regulate takes place territory takes place i think thats different question thats if theyre taking lowwater mark virginia side but im trying understand nature question justice breyer when build hole building hole virginia so theyre building trench virginia yes thats right maryland may objections future point time thats activity thats taking place virginia well may i dont know whether would actually change that imposes restrictions three major users potomac river washington aqueduct army corps engineers the fairfax county water authority washington sanitary suburban sanitary commission imposes limitations amount water take periods low flow subject permitting system place time still place and permitting system thats ever place respect potomac river permitting system established state maryland and i think id like go back initial point i tried make beginning maryland right well maryland administrative judicial review proceedings answered question but reason maryland took the action fairfax county already existing waterway intake pipe in river they wanted build another intake pipe 725 feet river edge would 30 inches water 5foot walkway maryland took position lets see less intrusive alternatives available virginia wanted fairfax county wanted concerned effect the water shoreline existing intake pipe wanted get cleaner water from middle river and maryland took view well lets see less intrusive alternatives available maryland objection fairfax county water authority withdrawing water marylands objection minimize impact potomac river yes because riparian rights well was part it scenic portion potomac river what compact justice scalia provides potomac river could used common highway citizens states also secures important private property rights private property rights citizens states that states that thats exactly court said yes the state commonwealth virginia brought action behalf citizens seek no no yes the weve never denied no irrelevant justice because compact secures it makes compact drafters recognized difference jurisdiction sovereignty private property rights wanted knew exactly go addressing issues sovereignty yes and marylands view that part award confirms marylands rights river and id like explain little bit fully what blackjenkins arbitrators rejected virginias claim right soil right soil beyond water mark right islands river right part bed river now and presumption justice oconnor overcome looking rest award the arbitrators give virginia title middle bodies water namely the tangier sound pocomoke sound pocomoke river but specifically rejected the arbitrators said virginia full dominion right soil lowwater mark beyond point virginia right use river a right use dominion title sovereignty a right use justice scalia subject governmental authority regulation thats exactly court said this court said example massachusetts v new york massachusetts right use lake ontario still subject regulatory authority new york new york title bed lake ontario the maryland treat identically thats set forth clearly article vii compact not kind adverse impact marylands perspective whether maryland if city rockville wanted would encounter presumably exactly kind reaction fairfax county initially yes no court said yates v milwaukee that riparian right cannot arbitrarily capriciously denied and well your honor i think i i think set forth yates v milwaukee court said state cannot government municipality cannot arbitrarily capriciously deny someone exercise riparian right yes i think i mean property right it property right cant arbitrarily yes and im clear justice kennedy rule law administrative hyperbole governed judicial administrative review proceedings led fairfax county getting waterway intake pipe permit i mean it went process maryland thought valid reasons restricting the permit maryland was overruled permit since issued and case maryland arbitrarily deciding well dont like whats happening and and i think also required constitution i think due process clause maryland cant arbitrarily and capriciously deprive someone property right no and maryland gave compact and blackjenkins award provided and go back the problem with special masters recommendation marylands perspective began wrong place history he began compact he begun charter plain language charter gives maryland river and question point since maryland owns river maryland sovereign authority so justice ginsburg the flaw reasoning ignores plain language charter court said includes potomac river unmistakable terms bank it doesnt matter kind competing claims existed 1785 compact written what matters title virginias view maryland maryland basically deed holder this royal deed virginias view royal deed could create rights interpreted either arbitrators court which court noted anything divest maryland authority maryland first time first line first time and it 1632 there subsequent deed given but yes 1609 virginia initially set charter annulled 1624 it converted royal colony meant king charles i 1632 right carve maryland virginia he created maryland proprietorial colony at point way maryland could lose rights charter quo warranto proceeding it initiated 1685 it never resulted anything arbitrators 1877 noted and maryland no im saying compact wrong mr chief no the i think all im saying maryland authority result plain language charter no i think fair reading document of the 1785 compact 1877 award reasonable minds may differed and states decided going address issues navigation if i said let retrieve immediately i meant say laughter what i i meant say marylands title changed one iota almost 400 years i agree justice scalia goes long way resolving question acknowledging that boundary dispute acknowledging maryland indeed title river virginia acknowledged marylands regulatory authority correct i think fair reading compact states agreed couldnt agree boundary decided and and i think states agreed wherever boundary citizens states would rights access river and reason they i think the view fair reading would wherever boundary if end day boundary virginias side yes maryland gets decide activity occurring maryland this maryland not virginia potomac and id like no thats settled article i think article viii compact i would thank mr chief justice prior case virginia never taken position authority take kind regulatory action respect piers wharfs beyond water mark and fact virginia done sent hundreds citizens maryland told citizens construction projects virginia side potomac river fall outside virginias jurisdiction fall within marylands maryland owns bed river that ownership gives maryland right putting aside moment agreements gives maryland right regulate withdrawals water maryland and left moment article vi fourth paragraph blackjenkins award says give virginia full dominion right soil justice scalia i would disagree gives virginia sovereign rights use river beyond point gave virginia unrestricted right use potomac river beyond point thats called quiet title that means virginia gets wants maryland cant regulate court said idaho v coeur dalene tribe that kind regulatory action unrestricted equivalent quiet title action the blackjenkins arbitrators rejected virginias claim title middle river they set virginias boundary lowwater mark virginia side they could done boundary line they could drawn around piers wharfs they showed unbelievable dexterity drawing boundary smith island they went bottom chesapeake bay bottom third smith island back they didnt virginia side potomac they set lowwater mark virginias side title virginia title lowwater mark right use beyond point it unrestricted right use the right us subject governmental authority the government gets regulate government owns thank the honorable court adjourned tomorrow 10 oclock,1015.0,1408,69,well hear argument next no 120 original virginia v maryland mr baida mr baida get argument i ask preliminary question i made mistake reading masters report i read briefs theres awful lot discussion entire river issue is youre longer making point do think compact covers withdrawals water virginia i mean directly cover well do take position maryland could reject every effort virginia withdraw water river what position which includes right use water and take river with permission but permission its last step thats problem laughter is right only marylands permission is reasonableness part assessed fact maryland sovereign pardon that virginia sovereign virginia rights virginia rights greater private landowner even even assuming thats true i i thought right right i i thought right something it doesnt mean somebody turn and riparian rights include right take water thats clear and thats right take water not right come beg maryland take water but compact reserves state virginia citizens riparian rights if riparian rights include i think right take water seems aspect case is quite easy decide im mixed im sorry maybe i didnt think case basically taking water river i thought building something purpose taking water is actually youre saying i may misread actually youre saying if somebody governor virginia goes river bucket takes water little bit water wash pans get marylands permission is taking water river is building something all right so youre addressing problem taking water river so person lives next river common law 1302 whatever go river take water hes thirsty yes all right so virginia taking water happen lot people thirsty laughter so whats whats special thing water i thought building water intake system all right lets imagine building then would objection because cant take water youre thirsty there many thirsty people objection right it doesnt what they build a hole fills water potomac hole happens virginia filled water drink now objection they havent built thing no im asking objecting building objecting separately i hadnt focused taking water without building anything no they nothing built what happens water comes potomac virginia drink in virginia yes thats i thought case unless trench creates new lowwater mark potomac i mean i think thats marylands argument would make inlet virginia thats thats lowwater mark potomac i didnt want get mixed all i wanted i focused case matter building something i didnt focus matter taking water and im thats problem now maybe forget problem maybe im one so skip let let ask theres potomac river flow allocation agreement 1978 does deal right virginia use water take on amount acknowledges water removed fairfax county before i ask practical question how maryland adversely affected pipe water intake is adverse impact maryland maryland trying say sovereign so even though people adversely affected need get permit us is adverse impact maryland residents why yes because wasnt enough water people in maryland thats one thing well sovereign give permission another people going enough water virginia i think youre saying maryland objection what authority minimize impact the compact states gives state citizens riparian rights including right build structures river long impede navigation was marylands objection that new structure would impede navigation river its navigable portion anyway isnt so so objection it ugly well reserved right in compact the compact could said know provided impede navigation ugly laughter all right let i may let interrupt do concede state rights article vii compact the state state virginia commonwealth virginia article article vii talks citizens it doesnt talk commonwealth well i mean premise argument do also deny state respect withdrawal water citizens deny state stands shoes citizens no i realize denying may properly so effect saying state it though state express rights article vii making claim making stands shoes citizens citizens rights is concede then irrelevant article vii speaks citizens state is correct then what difference make now one questions case youve answered justice souter posed questions way based article vii paragraph clause vii of compact but must interpret according blackjenkins award particularly paragraph 4 page c4 of the special masters appendices that uses says virginia citizens that says virginia riparian rights two phrases used compact the phrase riparian rights i dont think used compact compact talks citizens but blackjenkins award goes seems interprets authoritatively correct im wrong compact means and i read black least i think permissible reading say virginia well argue sovereign that thats thats phrase i add riparian rights so really focus section vii part 4 blackjenkins award yes said pointed virginia given proprietary right privilege erect structures necessary full enjoyment virginias riparian ownership presumably encompasses taking water yes deny virginia riparian ownership lowwater mark potomac but says why but right use thats youre thats youre contradicting thats want theyre trying govern river they want use well says blackjenkins award earlier compact privilege erect structures necessary full enjoyment riparian ownership that might mean pipe take water mr baida i ask sort basic question in view difference right virginia riparian rights virginia one hand riparian rights marylands citizens who property maryland shore river do equivalent or difference riparian rights people opposite sides river so either either side river property owner could stick pipe drain river you say riparian rights either side river subject paramount authority maryland state maryland to govern happens water and exercise authority could maryland give higher priority citizens rockville citizens vienna virginia no its arbitrary capricious they make lot findings said theres much traffic virginia virginia would better rural laughter and what source statement maryland nonarbitrary is riparian water law constitutional obligation one state owes another so opinion but thats based on thats statement riparian law so talking talking property rights were talking definition riparian right so opinion you used word arbitrary i didnt i want know source law governs marylands obligation point submission make determinations and said fair among riparian owners riparian law requires your point what provision constitution oh thats obligation citizens virginia doesnt special standing state what wrong special master saying yes maryland 1632 decree it looks grant it looks pretty good but virginia grants and i think theyre arguable so states sensibly twice dealt but argument seems hang 1632 document indisputably everything else flows the special master said necessarily they couldnt even resolve 1785 they finally resolved 1877 wasnt inevitable truth 1632 rather virginia grants but royal deeds different kings royal decrees that virginia i thought earliest time wasnt 1609 something the but saying compact 1785 blackjenkins award 18 were simply wrong didnt follow interpretation youre giving are saying blackjenkins award wrong well saying implicit assumption least 1877 blackjenkins award 1785 compact implicit explicit assumption maryland owned river well i thought i arguing making argument so seems justifies special masters approach you i thought saying oh proceeded wrong premise this the boundary line settled all talking is rights or ownership stuff but youre saying if everything grabs 1785 compact blackjenkins award look mr baida maybe im missing something i understand state virginia contesting ownership maryland bed river is is contested virginia i thought concede river right lowwater mark southern shore virginia shore belongs maryland but that answer question whether riparian rights given citizens virginia state virginia requires that obtain permission maryland withdrawing water creating structure withdraw water no hasnt no hasnt but all subject fact owners sides river riparian rights right now question justice kennedy asked earlier im sure got answer who defines riparian rights i guess marylands side river maryland define riparian rights who defines riparian rights virginia side river do think maryland authority common law thats binding us kind overriding federal constitutional principle stake i think fair reading everybody thought would plenty water didnt decide all worried transportation river and weve got a possible problem enough water go around and i dont know compact addresses question defines riparian rights virginia side river does mean maryland define rights maryland side river may also define virginia side but contention thats what virginia legislature passed statute governing riparian rights state bodies water limited potomac could statute govern riparian rights virginia property owners potomac may i ask one quick question sit i think does maryland require virginias citizens maryland fishing license fish potomac it says rights fish argue riparian rights rights take water nonetheless require prior permission could also take ought also take position right fish requires prior permission so ought get maryland fish im darned im going get maryland fishing right fishing license do want reserve rest time mr baida very well mr raphael well hear thank mr baida the case

government must prove beyond reasonable doubt establish violation title 18 united states code section 1512a1c this death qualifying federal criminal statute must construed clearly consistently narrowly yet eleventh circuits opinion case conflicts rulings factually similar cases from second circuit lopez fifth circuit causey circuit precedent more specifically it would opinion inconsistent need court your honor the eleventh circuit erred placing word possible statute thus significantly modifying plain language statute proposing standard mere possibility justice kagan would offer standard realistic likelihood cited brief page 17 page 41 appropriate standard particular case that language comes lopez second circuit case also places higher burden government believe important order maintain federalstate balance required federal criminal matters it reasonable standard reasonable would characterize governors  governments standard reasonable possible in brief page 9 10 13 propose would add differs eleventh circuit said if youll remember lopez eleventh circuit offered standard possible and yet government backing away bit briefs page 9 10 13 used phrase reasonably possible and would concede improvement eleventh circuits mere possibility standard still vague it still upsets we believe subsection g statute precludes  takes mens rea element defendant table respect whether person law enforcement official whether theres ongoing federal criminal investigation we would agree law require defendant intend prevent communication the eleventh circuit puts word possible says intent prevent possible communication and thats rub justice alito asking court address we believe define would find  determine defendants intent based circumstances totality circumstances case the intent would realistic likelihood theres going communication yes your honor that gravamen offense that intent element essential the that correct we well it position trying determine jury determine future act the prevention communication denotes future tense word communicate so standard ask jury use order determine whether government provided evidence going future act prevented and well your honor believe the intent prevent communication communication future modified word prevent and thats  thats struggling your honor were trying come standard that correct your honor we would urge court pick particular standard youre going to help us interpret statute would strike appropriate balance state federal criminal jurisdiction we believe jury would make determination whether likely realistically likely mom would report federal law enforcement officials thats trying give lower courts  jury the result question intent or asking result then would say yes defendant could found violated statute particular hypothetical well i would go beyond reasonable doubt government must prove criminal matter we would agree that well understand and  assuming course elements offense proven beyond reasonable doubt what weve tried provide court sort standard jury could instructed to prove fourth element future communication we i your honor i believe we believe given proper instructions definitions word realistic likelihood well i would answer two ways justice ginsburg number one happened case once mr gamble decided  4 years killing officer horner talk local law enforcement immediately reported federal law enforcement officials it reported years later so dont immediacy officer horner found dead march 1998 came forward local police 2002 sentenced 20 years unrelated state robbery there several years us attorneys office contacted decided go forward case us today 2002 came forward began talking law enforcement im sorry 2003 almost  almost year afterwards  taken no your honor you basically take offense find take officer find believe thats correct well  willing concede possible federal crime occurring time officer horners death im willing concede defendant  need proved defendant knew now government establish evidence believe goes defendants intent different element government need prove believe subsection g takes table we believe your honor reading statute that would basically federalize murder always going overlapping federal crime possible possible commission becomes standard reading interpretation 1512 every case going allowed prosecuted i would agree i  i would agree the congress sought deemed fit put word federal twice federal offense federal official well problem justice alito well im sure holding convenience store would qualify hobbs act federal statute creative there but needs proof  needs proof mere presence potential federal offense i believe third circuit opinion bell i remember correctly serving third circuit authored opinion set standard federal crime additional appropriate evidence order violation statute thats problem case federal crimes  well concede cocaine potential conspiracy rob bank  additional appropriate evidence meet standard so using opinion bell would ask court find it would  would make governments burden easier likely realistic likelihood theres going federal involvement justice scalia pointed case threat kill president hijacking income tax federal income tax well i would agree certainly state florida i would say state attorneys handle bank robberies much federal authorities but would concede bank robbery federal crime thats need something federal crime confer jurisdiction we need federal law enforcement involvement nothing record shows involvement federal law enforcement and thats case needs reversed thats eleventh circuits standard mere possibility broad looking rule court narrow keep  balance federal state criminal jurisprudence needs and quite frankly theres questions well trial lawyer poor job articulating reasons judgment acquittal well unfortunately judge i so thats i did poor job articulating judgment  judgment acquittal time reasons court grant quite frankly disservice district court judge need help but no well believe argument made eleventh circuit whether sufficiency evidence issue raised eleventh circuit chose rule chose rule statutory construction 1512  court granted cert basically took issue table that one possibility or the is overrule eleventh circuit instructions enter judgment acquittal i dont know particular point i know problem circuits standards applied across board need bright line hopefully brightline rule help us courts job better understood position rules proposed except maybe mere possibility overbroad still nothing record going show federal law enforcement involvement communication federal law enforcement going win point that fallback position thank sir ill better next time thank your honor justice kagan i could go question posed if court find mere presence possible federal offense appropriate give federal jurisdiction particular statute i would ask court consider effect that would criminal practice throughout country there significant overlap federal state criminal laws simply going confer federal jurisdiction particular statute mere possibility federal offense created huge exception would respectfully submit create problems delicate balance state federal justice ginsburg would agree bank robbery federal crime the question is evidence record would show going federal involvement federal crime every day federal crimes prosecuted state system state crimes absent federal involvement obliterated line state federal criminal practice broad believe upsets delicate balance must maintain if i could i want go lithuania suggest there number cases cited circuit court level give examples government meet proof quite frankly difficult in romero federal  ongoing federal law enforcement official investigation going ongoing lithuanian movie i exactly we would argue  record insufficient establish reasonable likelihood federal involvement and i cant put better thank justice breyer thank mr chief justice,783.0,1149,52,well hear argument next morning case 105443 fowler v united states mr crawford are consistent mr crawford whats standard sometimes say certain sometimes say likely sometimes say plausible which  standard the statute speaks intent defendant the defendant must intend prevent communication information federal offense possible federal offense law enforcement officer happens federal law enforcement officer so matter intent where get question whether possible likely certain whatever information eventually get federal law enforcement officer isnt  isnt simply mind defendant going  going back justice alitos question obviously statutes written say intent preclude witness talking law enforcement officials if simple federal crime wouldnt matter whether likely possible all  know witness  killing intended stop talking law enforcement period so clearly g meaning different merely stopping someone talking law enforcement officer connection officer federal officer so going back justice alitos question define intent what defendants intent if doesnt know federal officer intend articulate intent does defendant know thats question does intend stop witness communicating information someone thats related either federal judge federal law enforcement agent what say what reasonable likelihood would occur i mean either intends doesnt intend what the reasonable likelihood person killed  say realistic likelihood the realistic likelihood person killed might gone federal officer doesnt establish intent person killed prevent going officer i mean seems to stand one stool one either  relates intent statute says reasonable likelihood person killed would gone federal official which no  thats statute says it doesnt talk preventing future act it doesnt say anyone kills someone would gone federal official  subject penalty if thats said  realistic likelihood test would quite reasonable doesnt say it says  killing intent preventing going mr crawford think right statute says person prevent communication law enforcement officer the statute also says law enforcement officer fact federal law enforcement officer subsection g statute require person intend communication federal law enforcement officer thats struggling correct and   i mean i guess question question government standards come and i agree statute provide lot guidance one pick realistic likelihood possibility theoretical possibility things well dont pick standard set text statute let give example lets  lets hypothesize cold calculating rational defendant planning federal crime lets say hijacking airplane international waters defendant finds mother learned plot now says well know i think theres onetenth 1 percent chance mom going go fbi turn in order prevent im going kill i intend  i kill  purpose preventing going fbi even though i think very unlikely shes going hasnt defendant violated statute i dont  i think justice alito protect question i dont think youve answered youve put realistic likelihood hes asked whether matter law assuming youre juror read statute instructed words statute justice alitos hypothetical result the reliability statute justice alitos hypothetical all right then justice alitos next question  protect line questioning  realistic likelihood theres realistic likelihood half 1 percent chance communication would made so takes realistic likelihood table table give us different test thats i wondered you havent really argued maybe im missing something question may better side statute go elements the first facts world killing people second intent talk different things stop going federal officer third says state mind need proved respect fact works feds so therefore part intent now circumstance element offense part intent defendant isnt element like elements prove beyond reasonable doubt you didnt argue nobodys ever adopted i feel i might barking wrong tree now i grant youre leaf tree thats going give answer i need im wrong   youve researched havent really argued point so you think realistic likelihood must proven beyond reasonable doubt you think juror grasp jurors mind you must find there realistic likelihood beyond reasonable doubt suppose  suppose prosecutor argued realistic prospect when gamble confessed confessed local police immediately communicated information federal prosecutors so thats government counsel argues wouldnt realistic prospect  wouldnt likely done thing respect fowler respect gamble was  time sequence how much gamble came local police local police go several years 2002 when go federal authorities 2002 when go federal authorities 2002 what  position subsequent element  feature relating commission possible commission federal offense does defendant know actions prevent communication involve underlying federal offense why 1512g2 talks respect law enforcement officer i would thought youd say theres negative implication intent shown respect everything else including whether possible federal crime are willing concede defendant knew the issue  issue sufficiency evidence so   question whether reasonable juror could adopt certain view facts now couldnt reasonable juror situation take view facts your client killed officer horner simply client didnt want go jail he didnt particularly care whether going prosecuted state court federal court didnt want go jail so intent prevent communication information crimes planned law enforcement officer could send jail would include state officer also would include federal officer and therefore theres violation statute now whats wrong view facts i would think answer would law a1c would omitted word federal it would said person law enforcement officer  and would  would eliminate judge united states  information related commission possible commission violation law  period no  crimes planned state offenses would chance  conveying information federal law enforcement officer would send person jail theyre planning  theyre planning hold convenience store its federal offense state offense so person isnt going go jail federal charge well saying possible offense thats violation state law federal law all right mr crawford would happen dealing federal offense distinctly federal offense really didnt state counterpart like hijacking airplane would sufficient support prosecution statute is actually similar case these guys going rob bank i take mostly prosecuted federal officials i one last one plain error question neither brief  i think youre taking position simply granted cert weve accepted theres plain error position because havent really defended finding plain error i take trial lawyer oh laughter so really  granted cert give advisory opinion because theres plain error reverse court so youre suggesting announce standard hopefully different courts sake remand let court apply new standard and whats how could unless found plain error and say theres plain error question vexed many courts i say even brightline rule announced real work begins deciding evidence sufficient meet burden anyway youve made fine argument even didnt make laughter thank counsel ms harrington whats delicate robbery i mean robbery clearly federal crime  horner observed  planning robbery next day im slightly regretting bringing you agree basically point i think  somebody tries prevent general thing normally say also prevent  tries prevent things specific fall within general term every oddball example and want something rules oddball examples and words reasonable likelihood youll say oddball example cant hold guilty turns case federal example oddball example my question really if win going go back argue one piece evidence whatsoever reasonable likelihood feds would investigate case thank counsel the case submitted,862.0,1656,27,mr chief justice may please court when congress enacted section 1512a1c sought protect integrity federal criminal investigations prosecutions the statute requires government prove four things  actus reus mens rea two federal nexus elements one issue case the actus reus murder mens rea thats common every prosecution section 1512a1c intent prevent communication information law enforcement officer the first federal nexus element requires that information relate commission possible commission federal offense second federal nexus element one issue case requires theres reasonable possibility information would communicated federal officer murder occurred well comes trying construe different relevant provisions statute make sense together section a1c specifies defendant intent prevent communication relevant information law enforcement officer section 1515 tells us law enforcement officer federal law enforcement officer thats definitional section section 1512g2 specifies government doesnt need prove state mind fact officer federal officer yes in view two different ways prove violation statute one read section a1c natural reading section  defendant specific intent prevent communication federal officer specifically thats violation statute what subsection g2 tells us dont need prove federal officers specific intent every violation statute prove thats enough and case theres evidence petitioner specific intent federal officer example officer horner said hey im fbi hey im calling fbi right killed would enough whether true yes thats right section g2 described circumstance federal officer question federal officer thats  thats fact world jury needs make determination of course fact world thats okay i going say fact world something  design defendant never going happen the communication thats issue  dont federal officers specific intent communication thats never going happen jury make reasonable prediction could happened absence murder if  but  so say shoot guy keep talking fbi thats still violation statute requisite intent federal officer well clear realistic possibility part comes defendant doesnt specific intent federal officer specifically so justice alitos hypothetical intent prevent communication fbi particular defendant specific federal officer specific intent doesnt matter whether might happened would happened could happened where reasonable possibility standard comes cases like one defendant intent prevent communication law enforcement officer sure doesnt specific intent federal nature well i think jury instruction would say know need make determination could happened murder hadnt occurred find reasonable possibility would communication federal officer  proved number different ways particular case  find theres violation statute yes right well i think thats interpretation statute government could live effect but  indeed but aggressive reading reading offering congress went extra step defining law enforcement officer mean federal law enforcement officer so interpretation youre positing would essentially read statute right the reason i mean congress could written statute way congress defined law enforcement officer mean federal law enforcement officer presumably meant mean something and g2 they take federal nature law enforcement officer mens rea part offense describe circumstance presumably  relate something could happened world absence murder correct i except crimes could prosecuted federal crimes prosecuted federal crimes for example  drug crimes prosecuted state authorities rather federal authorities even though not if no doesnt and i think particular case drug crime underlying crime could serve predicate crime but i think matters jury reason conclude jurors generally dont understand way federal system works visavis state system and theres reason jury think information might gone federal officers wouldnt basis conviction statute you could  could give instruction i  i think  i took hypothetical justice scalia wouldnt need show theres  chance communication would gone federal officer and i think would read federal officer definition statute required offense federal offense and could say well know theory  true anybody information commission federal offense theoretically could someday choose give information federal officer i think would justice alito i think first case jury wouldnt reasonable basis conclude information might gone federal officers absence murder in second case would reasonable basis make inference it doesnt anything defendants intent again two different ways view prove violation statute one defendant specific intent preventing communication specifically federal officer if federal nature officer mind thats one way prove violation statute if doesnt specific intent going cases honestly prosecuted statute prove theres reasonable possibility that communication would happened but hypothetical i think borrowed justice alito specific intent prevent communication fbi federal officer specific intent but reason weird design defendant killing victim prevent something happening jury asked make  make determination whether thing might happened and dont  place high burden government youre basically giving defendant acts efficiently early criminal process leg youre  require government prove likely communication question would happened federal officer youre youre giving sufficient protection communications federal officers would cause federal investigation initiated right youre  well i guess see  see  sort ballpark either government needs prove likely would happened need prove reasonable possibility and would opt second two options you could the difference proof  i mean depends particular case right in many cases actually prosecuted statute theres already federal investigation underway cases element easy prove yes so cases issue cases like murder happens almost contemporaneously federal criminal activity and cases nobodys chance even think initiating investigation  initial communications vital protecting federal interest protecting integrity federal investigations right and i  i would like try separate there question element crime  define  evidence would introduce satisfy element in case certainly government could introduced evidence  local law enforcement officers report evidence bank robberies fbi that would enough they didnt introduce evidence what introduced instead local law enforcement officers later got information sources shared information federal officers if hadnt proven contention wouldnt  evidence would sufficient sustain conviction well justice scalia i think would insufficiently protective federal interests say could  would look defendant mind chain communication might didnt murder person witnessing crime most defendants dont think wow know officer horner going call dispatch dispatch going call know person haines city police department theyre going call sheriff theyre going call federal law enforcement officers defendants wouldnt  wouldnt thinking  sort chain communication way but statute criminalizes killing someone prevent communication communication particular communication communication person information relating commission federal crime i mean many things  many cases element thats difficult prove if say witness particular investigation going testify particular trial murdered easy prove federal officer nexus satisfied but congress also trying protect information would cause federal investigations initiated those important communications if allow murders people witness crimes order prevent reporting information law enforcement officers reporting information would caused federal investigation initiated youre insufficiently protecting federal interest prosecuting federal crimes not unless custodian cemetery cell phone saying im calling 911 so  whats important well terms whether evidence presented case sufficient sufficient jury knew two things they knew first officer horner definitely would communicated information thats relevant case local law enforcement officers second knew local law enforcement officers later acquired information sources shared federal officers so didnt know first step didnt know definitely person killed would communicated local law enforcement officers wouldnt reason  first might  correct specific intent prevent communication law enforcement officer required yes go ahead yes i guess view less important words pick than mean and realistic  realistic probability realistic likelihood right and  doesnt perfectly map problem case course subsection g2 specifically says take intent equation and ill concede awkwardly constructed statutory provision but i think important i would agree would like well  depends  mean realistic possibility likelihood if mean likely would say thats high burden government we want include odd possibilities outlandish possibilities well i mean  attach word reasonably possible sort wall cases theoretically possible right so would like cover odd occurrences outlandish occurrences anything thats possible its  jury reason think might happened case with respect your honor dont  dont think thats correct i think needs reason jury think communication prevented information eventually would gone federal officers the reason because reality information  local law enforcement officers share every piece information federal offenses theres possibility i think and thats  thats court wanted go thats something government could live but well theres 10month lapse gamble went local law enforcement officers gamble testified federal grand jury so presumably federal  ausa brought sometime 10month period so wasnt long lapse i dont know difference i mean gamble  hew indicted eventually 14 federal offenses pled guilty sentenced initially life plus 107 years some  crimes indicted could prosecuted state court presumably could gotten life sentence murdering police officer prosecuted state court well no would say satisfied everything else because  still information relating commission possible commission federal offense still know officer horner definitely would transmitted information local law enforcement officers still know local law enforcement officers later got information would  transmitted federal its true and clear saying that communication happened 2002 communication prevented intended prevented what saying fact local cops got information 2002 shared federal officers thats reason jury infer would done thing gotten information well i think well course dont know would happened officer horner murdered prevent happening fact evidence jury suggested wasnt murder motivated share information federal officers one underlying robberies it robbery holiday inn federal offense the statute limitations run state court wanted  wanted maximize amount charges could bring chris gamble and decided share information federal officers so wasnt murder made difference one underlying federal offenses charged  one predicate crimes petitioner it could justice scalia i want point subsections a b a1 provisions talk official proceedings subsection a1c provision thats issue talk official proceedings it talks transferring information federal  law enforcement officers judges and doesnt  i think  reading sort plain reading provisions together means subsection c dont need official proceeding anyones mind underway time it could yes i think defendant federal officer specific intent mind commits murder thats enough no  violation theres reasonable possibility im  i dont mean give  case theres specific federal officer intent i may misunderstood question put if theres specific federal officer intent prove theres reasonable possibility one communications prevented murder would federal officer thank you,951.0,1393,46,well reasonable possibility standard come ms harrington let give hypothetical similar one i gave  friend two men sitting park bench planning commission federal crime hijacking airplane think theyre theyre talking theyve discussion turn around see theres somebody standing close say kill person prevent going fbi theyre prosecuted statute but trial bring evidence person didnt speak word english spoke russian so wasnt possibility whatsoever person going report fbi law enforcement officer violation statute so realistic probability relates question whether would conveyed federal officer opposed law enforcement officer but suppose justice  please continue i interrupted what see suppose justice alitos hypothetical two guys park bench find man gray coat behind listening they say get man gray coat they turn around shoot man gray coat different man what result it wasnt man listening they got wrong guy the intent but realistic possibility  realistic probability standard falls test well i think difficult instruct jury say sometimes theres realistic probability sometimes isnt i dont know jury instruction going look like why  need i mean always talking  murders witness right so youre always talking murder intended remove somebody could incriminate killer crime why isnt enough say killed person prevent disclosure crime crime federal crime disclosure preventing disclosure federal court federal police officer why  create  reasonable likelihood person particular person would gone federal officer rather state officer isnt enough kill person prevent disclosure crime crime federal crime why isnt test oh government could live the government could wallow no statute reads statute it says g dont  intent element  require know federal officer know federal judicial proceeding why isnt enough  kill somebody prevent disclosure crime thats federal crime isnt  federal  underlying federal offense i gather dont think  needs shown matter fact right no intent respect isnt always likely theres going reasonable possibility reasonable likelihood communication going go federal officer its federal offense if communication covers federal judges thats person going try case every case no obviously so think  element crime feature prosecution depends upon percentage crimes prosecuted federally opposed state law can instruct jury underlying crime federal crime say thing determine standard whether communication would federal officer lets say case  case arises  exactly case arises two different adjacent jurisdictions in one local sheriff local district attorney hate feds they never talk unless absolutely and officer horner taken information learned local sheriff theres chance whatsoever would referred fbi us attorney prosecution federal court realistic possibility in jurisdiction right next door local sheriff local da dont want bothered bank robbery trials they send fbi us attorney theres high probability information would gotten federal authorities now would case come differently depending jurisdiction i dont see defendants intent okay get then change answer  right maybe dont  hypothetical shoot wrong man isnt rather strange trials its weird issue submit jury criminal trial know whether witness  whether theres reasonable likelihood person killed would gone federal law enforcement authority rather state law enforcement authority im little bit confused tell exactly see difference realistically likely reasonably possible tell  tell fine line exists two quantum evidence would need one opposed tell difference proof would look like likely proven okay well still prove didnt wouldnt measure obligation witness get stand say fbi always looks bank robberies in absence arent asking jury speculate merely federal crime  bank robbery state federal  reasonably possible would go everything said everything goes federal government miss harrington  weve gotten along 200 years without particular federal law i therefore inclined give  sweeping broad interpretation i think weird submit jury know likely dead person would gone federal law enforcement officer rather state law enforcement officer why isnt entirely satisfactory reading statute following  indeed mind specifically fbi federal proceeding youre done if however dont mind specifically federal proceeding mind particular proceeding federal proceeding particular officer federal officer youre done anything else isnt covered so intent intent stop particular proceeding  stop person going particular officer if proceeding federal officer federal defendant  otherwise laws weve lived 210 years continue apply   new federal statute apply i suspect mainly addressed  killing witnesses become common jurisdictions witnesses criminal trials know darn well trial involved its trial thats already underway federal trial kill witness youre  youre liable statute what  covered beyond  know information going given federal officer also i dont know read statute broadly  weird questions submitted jury likely  dead person would gone federal officer rather state officer  inquire question justice alito asked know friendly relationship state local officials state official would  i dont want get i dont think juries ms harrington would  would happen instead officer horner custodian cemetery come across people exact thing happened would say would  would prosecution  could prosecution statute so difference officer horner cell phone i question i would like ask point are finished because interesting i normally think purpose important in one i dont suppose im right purpose nothing the problem words intent prevent and theyre used ordinary english so let give example even odder justice alitos but i think illustrates point  question imagine put son room say keep son room homework because i wanted prevent going movies thats now say would impute correctly wanted prevent going hollywood movie you wanted prevent going old movie prevent going new movie prevent going lithuanian movie now sound odd because theres realistic possibility would go lithuanian movie okay laughter now thats problem thats problem words capture problem words realistic likelihood words possibility so i choose two problem dont i choose solution all right they use realistic likelihood someone tell odd example realistic likelihood would go lithuanian movie seems describe perfectly whether i would would say trying prevent going movies try prevent going lithuanian movie and  doesnt  i mean  i agree may make much difference choose form words understand mean would okay went lithuanian movie laughter no wouldnt okay dont normally say person thing really weird wants happen doesnt  unlikely i shoot arrow air hoping fall enemy all right its going but say intended you see  thats kind linguistic problem i think present its awkwardly constructed its trying get odd possibilities trying get odd possibilities normally would say intend prevent happening things trying leave realistic possibility would happen then lets take words im sure i understand answer justice kagans hypothetical we   theres proof particular officer shot going pick phone fbi he may overheard he would called fellow officers somebody probably supervisor das office going make decision whether call fbi so different cemetery caretaker going call probably 911 doesnt particularly idea whos going get involved really issue why difference two situations and isnt question going back justice breyer asked whats likelihood going get investigated federal government why reasonably possible anything reasonably possible  almost anything so i guess burden show federal offense need show anything else reasonably possible encompasses every single federal offense anything could termed federal offense but isnt  maybe i asked already isnt case youre dealing federal offense oh theres possibility a realistic possibility did say  presenting jury everybodys worried jury think gamble came confessed local official went  federal i think told year lapse local police knew gambles confession do know difference state federal penalties so ms harrington suppose officer horner come scene instead seeing evidence robbery occur seen evidence drug use now might federal offense typically wouldnt prosecuted  federal court would say statute satisfied because oh thats 4 years later that way past time incident occurred youre saying fact got information 4 years later shared law enforcement officers knew murder occurred result incident would kind inquiry would make time before murder would  would acknowledge statute vague enough intent requires could either intent prevent testimony given particular federal proceeding particular federal officer specific intent withhold proceeding officer happens happens federal defendant aware federal it could bear meaning couldnt oh i acknowledge particular judge  conduct federal proceeding could  could require specific intent proceeding judge officer happens federal officer so defendant mind particular officer theres potential violation statute defendant kills purpose preventing going federal  officer might happen federal officer theres violation  reading statute under interpretation thats suggested would distinction i think question its unfair ask  hypothetical i think answer yes thank counsel mr crawford 7

Idaho Power Company,73-263,131173200.0,141282000.0,Commissioner of Internal Revenue,Idaho Power Company,8.0,1.0,1,1366.0,1772,3,mr chief justice may please court this case raises question business income taxation internal revenue code 1954 the respondent taxpayer idaho power company public utility engaged production transmission distribution electric energy in connection business respondent performs substantial proportion  substantial portion construction work in years 1962 1963 tax full years question case the respondent constructed approximately 1300000000 new capital facilities primarily  that understanding mr justice blackmun in performing construction work respondent uses essentially two different types construction equipment uses automotive transportation equipment passenger cars pickup trucks heavier trucks trailers also called power operated equipment means primarily cranes tractors bulldozers road graters forth the depreciation construction equipment well case referred construction  excuse construction related depreciation now construction related depreciation mean depreciation construction equipment refer case depreciation construction equipment used taxpayer construction capital facilities in performing construction work respondent encourage wide variety construction cost it pays wages construction workers buys tools materials used course construction also incurs wear tear exhaustion construction equipment construction related depreciation on general looks account respondent capitalizes construction cost it compliance generally accepted accounting principles recognize construction cost including construction related depreciation constitute capital outlays operating expenses this fact also recognized federal power commission idaho public utilities commission require respondent capitalize construction related depreciation regulatory purposes however tax returns respondent treats matters somewhat differently it capitalizes construction cost for example capitalizes wages paid operators construction equipment deduct wages ordinary unnecessary cost business it also capitalizes cost fuel used construction equipment capitalizes cost repairs equipment capitalize depreciation it seeks case take depreciation immediate deduction current income the commissioner disallowed depreciation deduction years question tax court sustained disallowance ground section 263 code requires capitalization capital cost including construction related depreciation however court appeals ninth circuit reversed i think fair say opinion court appeals came surprise came surprise many tax practitioners internal revenue service many years taken position formal rulings construction related depreciation must capitalized deductible in position commissioner upheld long series decisions board tax appeals tax court court claims because long history almost taxpayers engaged self construction capital facilities complied services rulings capitalized construction related depreciation this long acceptance commissioner’s position makes immediate revenue impact case quite substantial most railroads utility companies many large industrial corporations well perform construction work i said taxpayers past capitalized depreciation either but decision left standing anticipated taxpayers would file claims refund basis decision rnternal revenue service estimated refund claims would amount 100 million tax full years currently open and large part forestall litigation would arise filing refund claims government petition certiorari case i turn discussion merits it first pointed deduction respondent seeks case would result distortion reporting net income construction related depreciation operating expense capital cost associated production income future production income present the cause deduction depreciation tend understate current net income would postpone defer recognition income respondent already earned in words respondent claiming case right take immediate deduction sanctioned normal accounting rules would effect postponing recognition income future years this court never permitted deductions amounts sanctioned normal accounting rules would effect postponing recognition income except whereas deduction clearly allowed explicit language statute position i go discuss statute permit deduction item case by normal accounting practice mean general accepting accounting rule kind capital cost must capitalized well sited couple accounting text brief also sited rules  they kept basis urge in words capitalize construction related depreciation that correct mr justice white mr justice douglas i familiar scc’s rules may i answer question however federal power commission regulates company rule requires capitalization idaho public utilities commission also regulatory agency respondent subject also requires capitalization there nothing mr chief justice or unconstitutional we relying upon constitutional claim case and depreciation taken back company books says allow tax purposes for example prop put books basis appraised value accountants depreciate right annually course can’t take deduction tax purposes certainly deduction certainly section 167 governs depreciation generally would permit deduction tax payer could take deduction merely took general books account that’s point i’m making that fact tax payer took necessarily controlling situation but took tax returns case taxpayer take deduction general books account right i turn know analysis statute must begin section 263 section provides i shall quote “no deduction shall allowed amount paid new buildings permanent improvements betterments made increase value property state” it position technical provision read narrowly to contrary court historically read broadly legislative expression accounting principle capitalization this court recognized course holding diverse items brokeridge commission stock appraisal litigation cause supplementary savings loan insurance premiums capital that section 263 stands broad requirement capital items must capitalized they course statutory exceptions broad requirement section 263 contain several exceptions also section 266 provides exception taxes caring cause but similar exception depreciation there nothing code would accept depreciation requirements section 263 there sure provision deduction depreciation that allowed section 167 as pointed brief section 161 code expressly makes business deductions including deduction depreciation section 167 subordinate capitalization requirement section 263 in words construction related depreciation falls within general terms section 263 must capitalized withstanding fact might otherwise deducted section 167 we believe view matter slight practically answer question presented because undisputed case construction related depreciation capital item it undisputed case construction related depreciation cost construction regulations section 263 historically acquired capitalization cost construction moreover pointed reply brief regulations section 48 expressly state requirement construction related depreciation must capitalized subject immediate deduction the respondent therefore essentially position contending secretary’s regulations misconstrued statute but making contention respondents following far short believe carrying burden showing secretary’s regulations unreasonable the statutory argument respondent makes case depreciation “an amount paid out” within meaning section 263 on first place believe argument overlooks fact court held lincoln savings loan capital items must capitalized whether might fall within strict reading literal language section 263 we need reach far case believe it’s clear construction related depreciation amount paid within meaning statute the secretary construed statutory phrase amount paid mean synonymous cost incurred and really construction statute makes sense that construction statute harmonizes fundamental assumptions income tax system congress could required capitalization actual payments could intended actual payments subject capitalization historically items issuance stock assumption liabilities using construction materials exchange property property given rise capitalization immediately deductible even though actual payment taking place time capital asset acquired what important statutory scheme simply capital asset acquired cost incurred liability assumed rather responsibility undertaken properly capital item and case respondent using construction equipment physically exhausting equipment incurred real cost coarse acquiring capital asset cost incurred gives rise capitalization requirement but even statute read literally requiring actual payment nevertheless require payment made taxable year question thus respondent pays incurs wage expenses course constructing capital facilities wages aren’t paid following year nevertheless capital item first year actual payment payment made following year accrual wages first year gives rise capital item perhaps point case if respondent purchases construction materials one year uses construction materials two following years construction materials used capital item capitalized part basis capital facilities constructed and depreciation really exactly consumption construction materials the payment made first year construction equipment acquired but construction equipment used depreciated gives rise capital item exactly way using construction materials subsequent years thus in case payment earlier year using asset already paid course constructing new capital facilities physical exhaustion usage materials part cost construction represents amount paid within terms statute capital item we feel conclusion supported provisions code in reply brief sited sections 174 182 615 616 617 all provisions permit taxpayer deduct items would otherwise capitalized and provisions permit deduction construction related depreciation limited circumstances we think clear congress providing deduction kind depreciation limited circumstances express  first place expresses awareness depreciation would otherwise capital item subject deduction and secondly indicated intention circumstances covered provisions depreciation would still subject capitalization would deductible item and finally i would like emphasize trying case achieve tax parity taxpayer taxpayers acquire capital facilities and i think seen following examples well i give several examples mr justice stewart taxpayers for example respondent case rented construction equipment instead purchasing use rented equipment constructing facilities rental payments would capital none could deducted immediately part new capital basis new facilities similarly respondent form subsidiary corporation construct assets kept new facilities although subsidiary corporation would entitled depreciation deduction section 482 code that correct  under section 482 code parent corporation would required pay subsidiary enough offset depreciation deduction would give subsidiary advantage would simply wash payment made parent cover depreciation would capital item would deductible parent part cost parent expanded bind new capital facilities subsidiary and course outside independent contractors hired work payments contractor including amounts necessary cover depreciation contractors equipment would capital deductible that right points underlying thesis position depreciation incurred production immediate income expense operations properly deductible when incurred however  course ongoing business produce immediate income acquire new capital asset going used production income future capital item for reasons asked court reverse judgment court appeals i would like reserve remaining time thank mr chief justice i really little offer something closing counsel said cast mr justice powell’s question somewhat different like i want respond we taking position case financial accounting necessarily guide interpretation tax code we’re saying taxpayers claiming deduction even permitted financial accounting really ought show explicitly clearly statutory language permits deductions position statutory language shown contrary pointed section 263 explicitly bars deduction necessary impact sections 161 makes deduction depreciation subject capitalization provision there number small points case argued i think they’re properly answered brief reply brief i won’t go length one exception taxpayers argument something cases sections 170 213 pertaining medical expense deduction charitable contribution deduction favorable well provisions provide deductions amounts paid taxable year courts construed depreciation amount paid taxable year purposes deduction provisions statute reliant section 263 require payment taxable year merely requires amount paid sometimes as shown amount paid represented depreciation the history estate local taxes caring charges interest long one the courts  i think 20’s 30’s perhaps 30’s holding expenses capital items improve value taxpayers property the courts held payments taxes interest merely incurred retain ownership property reason capital that’s right i think holding items capital subject question but case clear depreciation construction equipment incurred course improving property course creating new capital asset clearly capital earlier lower court decisions holding interesting taxes weren’t properly capital really holding economic grounds whether legal grounds i think really aren’t point nor i i say case respect medical contributions medical deductions charitable contributions purpose deduction provisions allow deduction allow tax relief taxpayer incurs expense wouldn’t otherwise incur cases respondent sites involves occasional use automobile airplane automobile airplane would depreciated anyway there reason purpose statute provide deduction permit deduction depreciation would incurred anyway therefore i think courts properly held deductible provisions again decisions seems us absolutely nothing issue case,199.0,144,8,we’ll hear arguments next 73263 commissioner idaho power i think we’ll wait little mr jones bleachers clear mr jones i think proceed whenever ready put back along way mr jones i suppose issue present time succeeding tax full years taxpayer what rely saying normal would normal accounting practice i know say authority having books company kept  so accounting purpose audit certificate treated suggested treated does scc accounting rule it unusual i suppose taxpayer treat item one way internal accounting purposes another way taxes because construction work mean if subsidiary corporation construction business would entitled full depreciation deduction ordinary income  and would depreciate without question wouldn’t although contractor demanded contracting business could mislead pre state very well mr jones mr kern will anything true estate local taxes paid equipment but  one cause ownership equipment used construction capital assets thank gentlemen case submitted,1608.0,1828,1,mr chief justice may please court in case idaho power company uses equipments trucks cranes etcetera part operations part maintenance part construction capital facilities that equipment life approximately 10 years it position taxpayer entitled deduct depreciation equipment life 10 years while position government depreciation capitalized added cost facilities produced life 30 years government’s position depreciation equipment used construction deducted 10 year life instead aggregate period 40 years would mean taxpayer couldn’t recover depreciation couldn’t recover cost property depreciation period 30 years property longer existence now several plot  believe answer questions turns upon question accounting turns question interpretation provisions internal revenue code section 167 one hand allows deduction depreciation property used trade business section 263 hand requires capitalization amount paid new buildings permanent improvements betterment increase value property state now turning first however since much made question accounting briefs i would like speak momentarily this question taxpayer’s accounting per books section 446 internal revenue code that section basically provides taxable income shall computed accordance way taxpayer keeps books regulations applicable section section 14461a1 stated certain special items internal revenue code provides rules computed accordance way taxpayers keeps books included among things research experimental expenditures appreciation etcetera so isn’t question way keep books taxpayer keeps books and parenthetically i would like state many things besides depreciation considered expenders  could considered cause property constructed taxpayer capitalize these weren’t mention i don’t know keep appearing briefs briefs mentioned taxes pensions things we didn’t think important taxpayers profitable position deduct interest construction internal revenue code always permitted taxpayers the permission deductions interest taxes could deducted regardless existence section 263 internal revenue code since 1913 since code came  since predecessors code came existence made deductible section 266 government would suggest they deductible  section 266 came permits capitalization interest taxes taxpayer elects capitalize so whole series things deducted internal revenue code provisions code possibly question good accounting capitalized turning specifically question financial accounting suggested government depreciation capitalized good accounting capitalize certain tax sided effect however respectfully suggested government would willing accept various types rules they’re applicable financial accounting one hand tax accounting accord financial accounting for example government referred reply brief accounting research bulleting number 43 issued 1961 american certified  american institute certified public accountants now 1961 particular bulletin pointed cost increase cost replacing equipment increases equipment improved inflation occurs historical cost depreciation provide fund replacement equipment stated particular bulletin proper management make annual appropriation net income contemplation replacement facilities higher price levels this financial accounting addition deduction depreciation order reflect properly the cost higher expenses books now course government would accept from government’s point view would creation contingent reserve deductible certainly since decision court brown v hovering 1934 so i don’t think government really understood concepts financial accounting applied tax purposes moving ahead however tax law specific accounting rules really indicated  really proper rules indicated congress adapting provisions applicable depreciation congress recognizing long ago 1954 increase cost replacement equipment method depreciation time permit recoupment cost assets expansion american business provided methods accumulating funds rapidly funds  accumulating funds rapidly depreciation funds could used business earn funds replace equipment could used expansion for example 1954 various methods accelerated depreciation permitted including declining balance depreciation twice straight line rate would allow deduction approximately 40 cost equipment first one quarter life two thirds cost equipment first 50 life added coming ahead present time congress 1971 adapted asset depreciation range system particular system permits taxpayers adapt class life first 30th percentile lives previously used taxpayer’s best bottom 30 quickest 30 reduce life 20 apply accelerated methods depreciations case five year property lave example taxpayer deduct 50 cost late first taxable year now kinds rule apply tax depreciation much consistent deduction depreciation taxpayer’s equipment useful life suggested taxpayer requiring taxpayer deduct depreciation equipment useful life period 30 years equipment longer existence the taxpayer much need funds replace equipment automobile cranes uses construction end useful lives taxpayer need replace equipment reasons replacement and part operations part maintenance part construction yes company keeps records books usage records available allocated portion depreciation allocated construction now position taxpayer question properly question statutory interpretation sections 167 263 congress manifested intention adapting sections now bring go way back beginning since sections internal revenue code first go way back civil war act 1864 legislating predecessor section 263 first appeared civil war income tax act provided deductions shall made amount paid new buildings permanent improvements betterments made increase value property estate almost exactly words used today section 263 now quite clearly time words intended disallow deduction depreciation concept depreciation time depreciation deduction act 1864 depreciation accounting pointed mr justice brandeis united railways electric company baltimore v west come use united state 1900 now i mean say civil war congress intention this carried present time what i mean suggest 1913 going acts particular time 1913 revenue act 1913 probably direct predecessor present income tax law congress chose adapt exactly language require capitalization that deduction shall made amount paid new buildings permanent improvements betterments made increase value property estate now believe important act congress indicated concept depreciation it stated act deduction shall allowed loses actually sustained including reasonable allowance depreciation revenue act 1913 one hand congress indicated thought depreciation lost value decrease value much described court numerous decisions lodi decision 1927 maci motors 1960 decisions congress thought reduction loss decrease value one hand depreciation hand required capitalization amount paid new buildings permanent improvements betterments made increase value property estate now situation  exact language continued till 1918 lost deduction depreciation deduction separated and head present time essentially situation continued believe indication present time congress continued intend depreciation shall considered amount paid shall capitalized instead regarded reduction lost volume and reason believe site opposite side i guess sections mr jones pointed said first briefs the  wherever congress intended depreciation shall treated equivalent expenditure word also used section 263 present act equivalent expenditure amount paid found necessary provide definition section code effect hand intended depreciation shall considered expenditure amount paid definition throughout internal revenue prior effect now congress found necessary define expenditures amount paid respect except consideration depreciation and sections 174 research experimental expenditures section 182 farm clearing expenditures 615 617 exploration minerals 616 mind development expenditures cases congress intended depreciation shall treated expenditure uses words effect allowances depreciation shall considered purposes section expenditures paid incurred hand type deduction hand congress intend depreciation shall considered amount paid equivalent expenditure provide for example sections 170 213 charitable contributions medical expenses deduction allowed amount paid payment neither sections word pave payment defined include depreciation neither sections treated courts including depreciation the case come use automobiles automobile used medical charitable purpose deduction allowed gas oil maintenance insurance similar expenditures deduction allowed depreciation automobile considered payment amount paid now course section 263 definition effect amount paid expenditure shall include term depreciation respectfully suggest light legislative history section 263 light way used since first came internal revenue code congress intend terms amount paid shall include depreciation within scope section 263 therefore depreciation need capitalized now i would like turn one facts government briefs mr jones briefly pointed effect long consistent administrative history requiring capitalization depreciation i respectfully suggest that true section 263 section requires capitalization came code 1913 also allowance depreciation going back administrative history administrative history regard regulations rulings sort thing government say thing capitalizing depreciations 1955 looking administration perhaps encompassing government litigated back 1920s four railroad cases concerned sense sited concerning requirement capitalization depreciation fact concern movement men materials work trains location railroads constructing new facilities and apparently buried cost cost movement accounted books saying one cent per man mile per man six tens cent per ten mile materials buried cost element depreciation now government time stated railroads capitalize cost moving man material locations these tax cases but  course icc accounting got depreciation buried within the government said cost capitalized court four times court’s four times time started board tax appeals held must capitalized one cases term depreciation ever mentioned and less mention passing there discussion analysis code consideration sections 263 167 now coming ahead four cases government came upon case railroad used equipment construct facilities great northern case decided 1934 board tax appeals government took position that depreciation capitalized this first case directly concerning matter now case actually argued government never took position section 263 requires capitalized predecessors today it actually argued question whether construction part railroads trade business court held depreciation permitted deducted and go ahead 1955 40 years since 1913 point came revenue ruling said effect taxpayers deduct  capitalize cost planting trees engaged forestry included depreciation planting equipment similar rule revenue ruling regulation revenue ruling years later concerning capitalization depreciation rely section 263 relied case said construction part taxpayer’s trade business i might say course make clear that question isn’t us today government conceded construction idaho power company facilities part trade business mr kern let get straight government conceded part trade business yes i believe what’s made clear reply brief page nine footnote but haven’t conceded whether principle trader business distinction no  i think government concedes mr jones i sure correct i think government concedes property property used construction wouldn’t depreciable it’s use construction section 167 depreciation far entitled depreciation depreciation must capitalized section 263 i assume question no questions we’re  the government’s concern we arguing section 263 historically intended congress disallow apply deduction depreciation depreciation amount paid terms section 263 requires capitalizations amounts paid so point departure when i discussing whether long consistent administrative history coming 1913 1955 government first asserted depreciation capitalized anyway 1955 in 1958 regulation mr jones refers issued regulation 1263 2 a regulation sets forth examples cost government state capitalized include therein cost acquisition construction reaction now example capitalized section 263 immediately regulations repeat mandate 263 capitalization required amount paid new buildings betterments etcetera but regulation say cost capitalized respectably submitted place says depreciation must capitalized depreciation shall treated cost purpose section 263 actually term cost applied internal revenue code means must capitalized code certain items would ordinarily consider cost perhaps popular economic point view maybe deducted certain maybe capitalized cost used regulations necessarily refers items must capitalized and following ahead along regulations last word treasury department issued concerning whether depreciation capitalized investment credit now investment credit allowed sections 46 48 allowed percentage basis property constructed acquired including property constructed taxpayer another fact regulations issued sections 146c1 148b4 effect taxpayer entitled take investment credit construction equipment entitled take investment credit facilities constructed in words regulations effect exactly accordance position taken taxpayer depreciation believe entitled depreciation equipment used construction include depreciation basis facilities constructed now true investment credit regulation written certain self serving probations words written terms depreciation sustained non property capitalized like won’t capitalized purpose investment credit instead considered part basis now proper interpretation law exactly contrary investment credit law statute statutes requires investment credit imposed basis property constructed taxpayer regulations another fact say basis shall include depreciation incurred taxpayer construction equipment in consequence i suggesting neither long consistent history treasury department requiring capitalization depreciation,25.0,34,2,mr kern automobiles referred used company 100 time construction use part

statute schools located low income areas the amount given schools purpose 30 per pupil attendance additional 1000 school 25 years old now lemon kurtzman earley dicenso court 1971 declared unconstitutional state laws pennsylvania rhode island appropriated public funds pay secular teaching religious schools on day court decided cases decided tilton richardson upheld face necessarily applied indeed quite clearly applied federal statute appropriated funds pay half cost constructing facilities colleges now tilton richardson plurality opinion court opinion distinguished federal statute add statutes pennsylvania rhode island cases the court said first place federal statute deals colleges universities rare latitude given establishment clause circumstances students mature resist pressure teachers sectarian pressure reasons therefore limits governmental action somewhat broader broader elementary secondary schools secondly court pointed onetime grant cases the money

facilities partly financed public funds used religious purposes indeed case court held unconstitutional unanimously part federal statute restricted removed limitation 20 years after 20 years statute federally financed facilities could used religious instruction court said unconstitutional no funds come governmental body maybe used finance facility used whole part religious instruction worship now present case statute applies elementary secondary schools colleges moreover onetimegrant  renew year perhaps statute forbid use facilities financed governmental funds religious sectarian purposes part

i believe implicit admission statute applied nonpublic schools would clearly unconstitutional i dont see denied there effort justify statute police power state provide safety health students while police power exercised within restrictions first amendment in flast cohen court held express provision constitution first amendment forbidding governmental financing parochial schools i know case court held express provision constitution cant transgressed police power the police power state inherent it used  word police origin use security safety people arrest criminals charged crime try

parochial schools the state seems also indeed clearly bases position this part statute limited schools lowincome areas again i know decision court holding critical relevant constitutional question question equal protection if state chooses certain class beneficiaries action excludes classes example state provides free counsel criminal case indeed must poor people wealthy people provide free access divorce cases indeed must poor people wealthy people cases provides transcripts criminal trial put wealthy people indigents indigents if state  quite clearly would  rational classification quite like equal protection state could constitutionally provide free access divorce courts faculty courts free transcripts public defense service indeed public schools public schools open everybody

indicated moment i overlooked one case fortunately would support position oppose research i done disclosed single decision many many considered question single decision holding constitutional difference direct grant public funds religious schools paying whole part tuition children attending schools the cases  cases many others supporting position brief  state constitutions establishment clause equal protection clause in inaudible cases decided lemon dicenso cases three i point three brief actually fourth one i must i say overlooked things i argued case slipped memory there four cases us district courts case threejudge court passed upon question one wolman essex ohio court affirmed without argument the case third case argued day one lemon kurtzman the fourth i cite brief i said i slipped memory lemon sloan  i mean nebraska missouri nebraska missouri district court missouri faced challenge parents children parochial schools state constitution state practice excluding parochial schools governmental financing the parents claimed violation religious freedom equal protection the suit started decision lemon dicenso may i address well i think right  technically right extent state new york contends distinguishes actually technically right chapter 414 single package it takes care children parents children incomes 5000 tuition grant it takes care children parents children incomes 500000 tax credit children  thats part  yes i say one single fact  yes part two  could severed rest applied parents children incomes 5000 that case  case different  however constitutionally distinguishable well i  position so reason i stated respect part one that limiting schools lowincome areas also purposed applied i said position  position cases come court court held cannot pay tuition persons attending nonpublic schools either equal protection specifically case express prohibition statute involved fact limited one particular class lowincomes justify otherwise would express prohibition financing religious schools the afdc payments payments poor children families used families  as far i know specific provision tuition and  far i know i believe  i know people beyond  sure far i know reason provision similar gi bill rights goes everybody   specific grant i fairly confident specific grant tuition schools tuition payable schools teach practice religion i believe unconstitutional well first place indeed pointed various briefs this case question question set – posed justice stewart also considered many cases ive referred considered past in respect poverty indigents as matter fact case majority court pointed fact  money goes part one goes indigent schools goes indigent lowincome areas almost  i differentiate tax credits unconstitutionality it says tax credits across board whereas lowincome housing  lowincome schools mostly catholic schools therefore specific religious group benefited therefore unconstitutional even though held tax credit constitutional now respect  not least not least i pointing court using argument reversed way i  i saying every case every case came court court lemon dicenso courts argument always stated declaration purpose money government poor people wouldnt able get education thats basis argument every case court deemed even dicenso law distinguished indigent nonindigent poor nonpoor school provided money go schools cost salaries paid teachers less salaries paid public schools poor schools lower payment therefore poor schools argument  argument cases without money poor people would able go private schools yes indeed it might well except private go colleges yes indeed i believe would i believe extend would because difference  not necessarily answers question chief justice raised these moneys go parents become funds they certain degree flexibility used must its true gi bill form law one gi get gi benefits world war ii got bonuses used bonus lot purpose some even gave away churches right it money it paid compensation services rendered income there stings attached now many parent  soldiers use money unwisely setup businesses gave away gambled away in world war ii decide put stings attached said rationale gi bill rights we taken group american young men away lives put army serve nation during period fortunate contemporaries didnt could continue education order make earn livelihood go college go trade school even go seminaries become clergy man make living way now one way send survivors armed forces back lost three four five years preparatory years instead giving unrestricted money world war i unfortunate experience dont say got use money give possibility making earning livelihood ought used preparation earn livelihood give money purpose might even argue set aside would unconstitutional religious liberty states  government said livelihood want accepting inclusion i arguing one way necessary  gi bill looked like because money used purpose money in case money could used purpose unless come back unless parent comes receipted bills private school  record shows brief shows 96  schools new york private religious schools so full part purpose means  certainly yes yes 4  schools i dont think  i think  i dont think token could really save country it didnt lemon  lemon case dicenso wolman  case two wolmans two assets cases one already affirmed without opinion unanimous case cases case i know  if money went tuition i dont believe would constitutionally distinct because still  still money tuition it isnt  they relevant mostly towards third point pointed court your honors opinion lemon dicenso walz your honors opinion walz statutes directed practically one religious group i relying like your honor said cases none voice overlap schools well thats your honor upheld walz decision pointed  pointed directed one religious group thats run distinguished the  well  no in respect  court pointed walz lemon dicenso division community religious grounds entanglement involved political attempt bringing issue political areas one things court attended prohibit relevant waltz towards constitutionality relevant lemon dicenso towards unconstitutionality now i suggest relevant towards unconstitutionality well created thin air it brought two decisions and  yes yes i add i believe even religious  religious affair i think court court everson mccollum inaudible cases torcaso watkins forbade aiding one religion religions make distinction i think unconstitutional whether one religion religion well answer i say your honor even restricted religion this  yes indeed one  bus transportation went religious nonreligious schools indeed thats true money paid  well  sense paid directly sense money paid pay tuition religious schools pay tuition  yes private school private schools 96  religious schools no it didnt originally go hands recipients  that changed  question brought congress realized constitutional problem thereafter change law tuition money went directly gi  yes gi became  he could use tuition anywhere wanted only tuition could use tuition tuition college public college private no yes thats right use college respect tuition limited specifically limited specifically except 4  4  i believe token put i dont believe could purify non uses limited specifically religious schools 96  cases i believe could upheld law if  mr chief justice done inspection standards involved surveillance schools sense lemon dicenso i believe could upheld lemon dicenso yes yes court pointed lemon dicenso yes found objectionable becomes two use religious funds court found objectionable lemon dicenso the court said  thats constitutionally objectionable hand fact least unless court overrules lemon dicenso fact found immunize use public funds religious schools could teach religion secular subjects thats court held lemon dicenso court indeed recently last year wisconsin yoder this court repeated statement court repeated i like quote court said recently last year wisconsin yoder found page 14 brief long general acknowledgment need universal formal education religion quotes specifically firmly fix right free exercise religious beliefs trusting fund right unequally framed even equally framed even thats explicit prohibition statute venue religion government the values underlying two provisions linked religion jealously protect sometimes even expense interest admissibly high social importance the invalidation financial aid parochial schools government grants inaudible regard one example extent courts disregarded notwithstanding aid programs legislatively determined public interest serves sound education policy state congress citing lemon kurtzman tilton richardson everson v board education fact cases difference facts case i  different cases four district court cases including one nebraska missouri i cited all cases 12 judges four court appeals eight district court deciding tuition grant one one judges held tuition grants constitutional its 332 federal sub 275 405 us 1050 last year 1972 now let read something 405 us 1050 97  let say moment court held nebraska case this dicenso lemon case decided suit started court respect says “faced decision plaintiffs argue alternative program tuition grants could constitutionally divide  selfcontent free government entanglement the court rejected

cannot realistically avoided plaintiffs granted aid parochial school purposes particularly continuing basis its self evident purpose affect statute tax rate funds assist parents free exercise religion would necessarily features court religion so 12 federal court judges one finding distinction state quotes south north context equal protection racial segregation one finding distinction direct grant tuition now i must devote rest time unfortunately i able go i must speak third tax credit part indeed important seems way wind blowing now i concede tuition grants held court constitutionally permissible tax credits constitutionally permissible that  yes i think reverse true i think reverse reason your honor tax credits merely onefourth paying tuition now speaking tax deductions speaking  thats court although  taking tax exemptions speaking tax exemptions tax deductions suppose  between exemptions deduction it might district court  case decided found tax exemption i want answer  complete answer i reserve time rebuttal the district court ohio case cited brief katya ph case professor froing ph among others opinion difference tax credits tax deductions equally unconstitutional i inclined think fairly good case could made constitutionality tax deductions tuition paid parochial schools i think wall difference credits deductions for reasons i dont want  i state brief stated court judge garfield ph opinion stated reasons difference tax deductions tax credits i think i could  reasonable argument could made payment tuition parochial school treated contribution parochial school words would deductible amount treat like contributions church tax  or medical deduction anything treated deduction i think could  reasonable argument could made constitutional i know thats poor point disagree i course respect inaudible constitutional law i believe made statute simply reduced tax liability certain amount instead paying government like owe youd reduce amount set forth determined statute nothing much deduct much tuition depend upon income status  i see difference situation owe government x dollars taxes pay government amount the government sends independent check tuition owed paid parochial school i see constitutions different situation situation instead paying government owe income tax youll send state receipted bill tuition deduct amount may  well dont get new  give money form tuition under statute so youll get money state loan  thats right thats right it doesnt good i  therefore state  statute give cash form tuition in ohio states give negative income tax rate they pay money dont pay i would like reserve rest time mr chief justice may please court i representing two groups parents one parents taxable incomes less 500000 eligible tuition refund section 2 act the group parents adjusted gross incomes less 3500000 eligible tax modification provided sections 3 5 act the emphasis i want make start statute aimed help parents schools represent

tuition ultimately reimbursable case exceed half actually paid it half actually paid 5000 per annum elementary school pupil 10000 per annum high school pupil i mentioned respect i think mr pfeffer misquoted morning he said could get full amount tuition cannot on tuition reimbursement provision trial court found good secular legislative purpose effect actually submit neither grants inhibit religion its nature pluralistic society see segments society right mature develop adequately represented new york tradition 200 years single system education public private board regions always laid stressed promoting plurality diversity refund i emphasized benefit parents goes parents there question conduit parent child school to get pay tuition beginning year pays parted money some months later filled necessary forms gets back state check representing small fraction may paid school he  thats money already paid school there connection two it perfectly open parent say i don’t like school longer i won’t bring child back next year i’ll take and right say “i’ve got 5000 state win i go spend races” or feeling charitable say wife “in lieu price steaks i going give money go downtown buy good nice steak celebrate with” there accounting in assertion morning  he knew money coming yes thats right just parent parent paid bus company everson knew going get back got back money i think your honor there discussion morning gi bill rights example tuition business i could  listed brief various similar items region scholarship scholar incentive programs new york state i shall develop as entanglement tuition refund requires minimum entanglement there must verification children actually enrolled schools entanglement a verification tuition paid verification individual question telling different stories people asking tax refund tax authority in words says income 4972 checked federal tax commission state tax commission see right turning brief moments left tax relief business we discussed brief question tax credit versus tax exclusion versus tax deduction a typical tax credit 1250 every new york resident entitled take income tax figures figures owe 48397 taxpayer allowed flat cancellation 1250 money whether millionaire whether pauper that example tax credit tax exemption i think best example your honor held walls namely particular person institution doesnt pay taxes doesnt pay particular category taxes this statute describes it tax modification comes mr justice stewart observed comes top rather bottom section 5 comes court strong legislative finding i going read such educational institutions refers institutions covered act religious nonreligious educational institutions provide education children attending existence relieve taxpayers state burden providing public school education children that finding adopted almost ipsissimis verbis district court as tuition reimbursement i emphasize partial relief the beneficiary parent school there grant treasury there secular intent namely equity benefit religious schools remote to involve permissible entanglement and minimum amount administrative entanglement all specifically spelled district court reasons sustaining constitutionality act i dont think i need say repeat state wide authority classifications tax things person i know holding unconstitutional the district court said holding secular purpose well facts strong lightening tax burden contribute public education deriving benefit albeit voluntary choice legitimate legislative purpose i accordingly request your honors judgment district court reversed tuition refund section section held constitutional judgment district court tax modification affirmed likewise held constitutional thank mr chief justice may please court an attack particular aspect state’s effort education fails unfortunately look state’s responsibility commitment education total aspect this somewhat happened today its purpose outline new york state’s legislature’s commitment responsibility education article 11 section 1 new york state constitution fixes primary duty provide education children new york state legislature it requires legislature provide system free schools wherein children state may educated we educate four million children elementary secondary schools new york state year approximately 18 750000 attend nonpublic schools the cost state financing public education rose 25 billion 19721973 fiscal year increased 500 million 19691970 year the cost state educating 750000 nonpublic school virtually nonexistent the cost educating  total cost education state new york 5 billion another 25 billion contributed localities the support nonpublic school education main contributions endowments late approximately quite 13rd tuition payments parents addition making tuition payments also normal tax load no don’t i’m attempting put total perspective educational aspect they paying sales taxes theyre paying real properties type real property tax they pay type real estate tax charge back landlord attendant apartment the greatly increased cost nonpublic education plus ruinous inflation plus ever increasing taxes levels government including education precipitated danger within nonpublic school system new york state i delineated pages 11 15 brief great consequences tax base public schools infer look number cities increase total commitment towards education to fulfill responsibility public sector state contributes cash grants aids general cash assistance per capita basis formula derived weighted average attendance primary form faced crisis public schools mindful responsibility education children including children nonpublic schools legislature enacted program review they determined public interest important nonpublic school system education new york continue exist available plurality educational opportunity new york state when talking children nonpublic schools talking new york state citizens children so provide cash assistance per capita aid basis public schools legislature responded overwhelming proportions private sector enacting program moderate minimal varied assistance low income children parents middle income parents support voluntary effort education this special isolated program part general program assistance education new york state indeed would seem new york state determined could quit educational responsibility total grant aid assistance parents public nonpublic if case allow parents determine schools wanted send children whether public private case would appear new york made choice machinery mechanism strike nonpublic sector would put form substance new york’s minimal program aid reflects appropriate required governmental neutrality toward religion it neither governmentally establishes religion governmentally interferes religion our task enacting omnibus act felt reach neutral ground establishment clause free exercise clause the new york program encourage attendance nonpublic schools indeed event going costly the state simply involved parent’s choice school parents chooses children while program may enhance ability parent exercise choice school child would attend nevertheless completely neutral favor religion nonreligion sponsor particular sect try encourage participation abnegation religion the question whether distinction made programs aid poverty area schools low income parents distinguish overall program in enacting legislation felt strongly program aid health welfare grants low income impoverished areas certain restrictions fall within welfare assistance benefit program considered welfare benefit program these restrictions follows the schools benefited incidentally 280 total 2000 nonpublic schools benefited section 1 schools benefited must schools substantial proportion children attending whose parents receive adc in addition thats required title iv addition title iv teachers schools gone higher education loans would receive forgiveness federal government teaching tight ghetto area schools the school cannot violation civil rights act 1964 to avoid question entanglement require school provide private audit there involvement state going the school provides private audit private audit forwarded state 2000 non public schools state 280 schools benefited section 1 under 15  12 the question arose whether chapel could painted the answer clearly the legislative findings restricted expenditures clearly secular neutral nonideological nature expenditures chapel clearly could fall restricted criteria the commissioner education state new york given authority promulgate rules regulations could approve result getting private voice overlap the heating system could replaced extent would fall within definition secular nonideological voice overlap yes it could replaced built statute consider statistical requirement neutrality  it could replaced preposition formulating legislation would never get position would pay total amount repair replacement heating system event cost reimbursed state 50 comparable cost public sector try build statistical degree neutrality thats correct purpose could provide total cost repairing heating system thats correct in answer mr justice marshall answer question whether could provide services repairs schools teach religion answer must areas nonideological secular neutral hopefully wont the number schools sectarian incorrectly stated 96 there approximately 82 nonpublic schools state new york sectarian and finally regard modification gross  adjusted gross income whether distinguishes type income tax change section 612 c new york state tax law provides 15 16 modifications an example modify adjusted federal gross income subtracting amounts income derived united states savings plan this modification well add section 612 c additional modification provide reduced graduated scale go line income 25000 amount would taken away reduce federal adjusted gross income new york state income tax liability the purpose would benefit parent benefiting state voluntary effort nonpublic private school arena first level benefit parent becomes involved types upstate moneys finally i would suggest question modification tax income court looked decision majority upholding modification program points involve subsidy grant money state treasury it particular secular intent one equity give recompense way tax relief citizens bear share burden maintaining public schools religious belief otherwise send children nonpublic full time schools constitutional right the benefit public appropriate schools remote involve impermissible financial aid church schools lastly minimum administrative entanglement nonpublic schools ongoing political activity likely cause division strictly religious lines it intent reach neutral point establishment clause free exercise clause submit judgment court regard health safety grants reversed regard tuition reimbursement reversed regard tax modification affirmed thank i think may even give rise question establishment clause well or even free exercise  free exercise establishment establishment clauses defined court number cases equally forbids aid religion aid antireligion the classic expression  oh i think inaudible school if secular school  oh i sorry i misunderstood i thought said school no purely secular school public school thats whats court held mccollum engle vitale schempp case well i dont see – matter fact court decided nebraska case nebraska case argument plaintiffs nebraska case violation equal protection nebraska case i cited morning respect suit brought parents children attending private schools parochial schools claimed violation free exercise private schools excluded the district court unanimously rejected court affirmed without dissent there let put way violation equal protection classification first amendment compels thats court held first commendment compels court said lemon dicenso compels non support whole part parochial schools so first amendment compels state complied obviously following action well i like address primarily i wasnt able morning tax credit provision it contention tax credit statute mrs coon conceded thats tax deduction stuff the court called tax credit now tax deduction statute obvious reasons in tax deduction deduct gross income amount contributed thats make contribution hospital art museum church he deduct the state figures brief jurisdictional statement parties briefs state figured page six brief amount get benefit get deductions clear benefits stopped tuition grant stops 5000 per child now make i make contribution 100000 church art museum i deduct gross income 100000 income tax determined balance if i pay tuition let’s say 5000 child  i dont deduct 5000 gross income i deduct 100000 child 300000 gross income in order get 5000 allowed per child now state done this analysis given state legislature it simply using device tax system achieve payment parents children pubic schools yes i several ways first deduction one uniform respect contributions there difference grant much contribute art museum scientific institution fpca market deduct contribute parochial schools here reason contribute 5000 art museums deduct 5000 taxable income here pay 5000 dont deduct 5000 taxable income deduct 100000 i would say first amendment  yes in context yes in context tax credit it would tax credit  it broader definition yes indeed indeed mrs coon conceded she said tax deduction i would deem unconstitutional i would deem unconstitutional obvious preference aid within class tax credits in  inaudible i said i believe thats unconstitutional constitutes benefit exclusively limited send children parochial schools it would equal protection  inaudible in event  title implies recognized mr justice rehnquist thats tax deduction allows money even deduct deductions even take standardized deduction dont itemize you already got benefit deduction whatever 10 whatever the statute specifically says still get still get amount even already gotten benefit the thing i answer means elevating form substances maybe pretense clear court pointed tax credit  opponent say purpose statute recognition serious finance conditions private schools nonprivate education put one statute things if whole purpose get money private school else whole purpose statute fails else provisions regarding impacted aids  oh no tax deduction applies equally every type beneficiary court answer walz uniform gift uniform treatment nonprofit organizations museums avoid entanglement i think tuition  services rendered instances if deductible deduction words amount paid deducted well i think deducted gross income i think i indicated maybe constitutional if deduct provided i think unconstitutional thats what done you deducting amount tuition you deducting amount state figured give back tuition 100000 per child pay tuition 5000 you get deduction 100000 300000  get tax liability reduced 5000 even you’ve already gotten deduction permnanet standby  deduction and state says statute says got make choice if want get money two ways you get benefit get benefit tuition grant section they’re purpose you take choice giving 5000 back one way you take tuition grant assuming you’re 5000 you take tuition grant take obviously purpose cases now i want make one point  mr haggerty said fact money cant used respect maintenance repair cannot used repair heating system far chapel concerned assuming isnt assuming thing back problem entanglement that propels state checking money used average enough tilton 50 government funds 50 government funds 50 came college yet supreme court said cannot use premises religious purposes even 20 years even one lecture religion even one mass set after 20 years even though government pays half federal government pays half remove constitutional thing the government cannot first amendment pay whole part maintenance institutions teach practice religion the court said long  court said mccollum maryland small portion school half hour hour week used religious education thank you,633.0,897,54,well hear arguments next consolidated cases 72694 753 791 929 mr pfeffer may proceed whenever ready you speaking part one aspect to poor people indigents those cases least  ones i familiar ohio case pennsylvania case argued following group cases provided various assistance across board parents whose children go nonpublic schools one directed impoverish families isnt right am i wrong right well thats part three i remember  you talking part two well thats another question case whether severable havent come yet either i directing part two and respect case different three cited us well question how categorical assistance programs mr pfeffer i thinking afdc cooperatively financed state federal governments the amount grant family dependent children depends upon  generally upon number children and provision made children afdc families go nonpublic schools know well i know i basically know program i asked whether made children go parochial schools do know i need either thats reason i asking  what grants gi program  tuition georgetown law school well would position point different particular area brought case us 80  lutheran 20  catholic would make difference 80  private nondenominational 20   well thats justification welfare progress particularly categorical assistance program afdc dependent children fatherless families isnt we case well schwab lynx i also captions wrong saying state couldnt cut aid child attending  petition higher learning no suppose case would gone differently institution parochial institution do  lets assume high school you think welfare  welfare  funds set  cut insofar children welfare family could go parochial schools that rationale hell world affect first amendment argument but fact used many go religious institutions voice overlap but  person cannot come receipted bill private nondenominational school but since emphasize percentages would situation view reversed 96  private secular schools 4  private sectarian schools as  well percentages arent relevance the walz case directed but didnt concern trying weigh measure proportions well whether 964 496 but i dont understand  majority roman catholic majority religious course walz religious definition and case then i dont understand conceive constitutionality payments made gi bill rights world war ii no money went aid religious institutions they didnt pay school if pay tuition private schools nonpublic schools but gi bill although tuition money went directly schools go hands recipient student but certainly didnt i gi bill four five years tuition simply went school but gi simply became conduit theres – tuition money paid  yes tuitions yes including  or grade school or high school no gi bill process inspection certification period fraudulent schools spurious operations establish regulations statute required school meet particular standard government checked whether money used wisely respect well certain amount continuing surveillance private schools   see meet standards established board education and thats found objectionable i speaking general surveillance nonpublic schools thats constitutionally objectionable you  i think give us citation missouri case cited brief will repeat last cite thank was parochial parents action   require states  thats somewhat different context do think reverse true also is difference mr pfeffer well difference – yes would tax deduction make different case we let answer lunch mr pfeffer luncheon recess mr pfeffer 15 minutes time left or medical deductions   service three catholic hospital whether credit deduction neither business income unless monthly income make sure ti thats right and deduction wouldnt body good without right very well mr pfeffer mrs coon i gather cannot profit making school profit making school that would matter fact would largely puerto rican community would he course recognized knew paid money school yeah of course voice overlap argument i think ought  thank mr chandler mr haggerty of course people 5000 paying  new york city people 5000 five children pay taxes state new york they’re paying sales taxes this comes 280 schools total around 2000 almost 15 well i take mr haggerty heating system broke statute entire heating system also heats chapel could replaced could well i know central heating system school collapses replaced heats every room including chapel and statute could replaced could i know question could could replaced could well point may able paint chapel repair heating system heats beside chapel cant but i suppose implicit answer schools would chapel exceed 50 total heated space reasonable assumption inaudible thank mr haggerty i got limit one question rebuttal mr pfeffer suppose  i start comment morning constitutional barrier state new york provided funds tax credits private secular schools would private secular school maintained antireligious people credits given give rise possibility violation equal protection possibly free exercise clause with free exercise  in hypothetical i wasnt assuming sign building antireligious school i simply assuming secular school patronized people want children voice overlap does give equal protection problem respect well mr pfeffer say tax credit now define tax credit opposed deduction exemption using term then definition tax credit broader one one would simply say tax credit amount subtract otherwise computed tax voice overlap well answer question but broader definition one i mentioned inaudible but get something entitled subtract adjusted gross income something entitled subtract tax already computed due but could make argument simply dealing orthodox tax deduction whole purpose get money private schools but suppose werent dealing gift dealing someone obviously payment services rendered tuition state made simply deductible thank mr pfeffer thank mrs coon gentlemen the case submitted,1491.0,2043,12,mr chief justice may please court question perspective think validity constitutional validity statute issue revolves solely around precise language statute intent purpose new york state legislature enact the legislature 1972 undertook meet certain specific needs children attending nonpublic schools parents it confronted growing clamor tax relief part parents paid tuition nonpublic schools behalf children also additionally support public schools form tax payments faced problem increasing safety hazards nonpublic schools particularly low income areas unable meet cost maintenance repair essential health safe structures further state become increasingly cognizant problem faced low income parents paying tuition necessary selection nonpublic school education children and finally directly relevant appeal still part legislative enactment areas financial crisis nonpublic schools forced closing public schools faced increased cost education general particularly cost additional physical space increasing enrollments consequently attempt meet impart alleviate district court indeed recognized basically secular problems the legislature state new york adopted chapter 414 laws 1972 now i address initially argument problem mr pfeffer left income tax portion legislation health safety grants finally portion statute relating tuition reimbursement low income parents the tax portion statute provides tax credit modification adjusted gross income purposes new york determining new york state income tax payable for new york state income tax purposes adjusted gross income federal state returns exception number state modifications there additional modifications gross income provided solely state law federal tax returns for example deduction allowed state return income tax state income taxes paid although allowed federal return state return additional modification allowed life insurance premiums paid although allowed federal return yes its  i think year well 150 less this court indeed recognized states inherent power authority enacting tax legislation the powers state tax citizens coequal federal government limited specific limitations states power found federal constitution yes yes you honor i we think particularly significant cases involving constitutionality federal income tax law court upheld validity face arguments differences classes income tax deductions exemptions allowed uniform tax payers could claim ones others could we submit new york legislature selecting enacting tax legislation power select income tax much income wishes tax provide deductions exemptions whatever amount whatever purpose elects a credit  tax credit different yes a tax credit comes tail end yes right now particular instance comes top this modification income  prior determination amount tax owed it comes beginning tax return its reduction income subject tax we submit equivalent legal principle deduction exemption thing reduces income subject tax forgiveness tax owed no no it also tax credit term generally understood tax credit also amounts precise dollar amount thats credit this  submit equivalent legal principle deduction exemption even though terms actual mechanism operates doesnt come way well closest analogy exemption related actual expenditure its fixed amount so closest exemption yes extent precisely way reduce taxable income no comes top new york state actually history tax credits related specific purposes there tax credit single married people directed reducing tax owed for example single person 1254 married couple 25 reduction past year taken tax credit income tax computed this  thats true credit now hand modification gross income starts top income tax return comes compute tax liability comes  yes except  figure slightly differently since figured differently amounts comes part tax return comes  no varies based upon income the persons income less 9000 less thousand dollars income  i think 20000 23999 100 zero amount so  right yes would point  point part return start computing taxable income tax liability and extent say operates much deduction exemption probably much closer exemption simply exemptions set fixed amounts unrelated purpose granted in words exempt present exemption federal income tax 750 yes but also unrelated unrelated actual expenses necessary live beneficiary dependent claimed yes laughter although actually new york state entitled additional day internal revenue district office massachusetts legal holiday today attempt laughter but exemption also varies  claimed additionally additional purposes exemption persons 65 going forth so exemptions multiply degree directly related number persons involved but extent also directly involved question actual amount spent say closer exemption deduction legal principle equivalent either deduction exemption rather tax credit relates modification taxable income prior computation tax due we submit addition modification gross income allowable tuition paying parents children non public schools less exercise state’s inherent power determine measure personal income subject taxation state yes i also point medical deductions example federal income tax difference really whether claim depending upon income the higher income less likely ever going get medical deduction federal income tax this initial portion statute submit simply exercise state’s power taxation also meets secular purpose effects set forth court schempp case the purpose statute specifically found district court provide tax relief tuition paying parents children non public schools it provide aid schools the primary effect also found district court would benefit non public schools rather tuition paying parent the court recognized fact time parent’s income tax liability fixed determined files returns tuition long since paid benefit gets reduction eventual reduction tax would likely pocketed used personal purposes rather turned school that inchronologically unrelated time paying tuition would therefore considered using parent conduit paying money schools without payment schools contact schools attended parent incidentally new york state income tax return claiming modification gross income parent required state school sent child he simply adds item return subsequently audited would question raised would ever prove school money paid no i get one we okay i know i all right without payment schools contact schools attended children submit entanglement governor religion let alone excessive entanglement the provision tax relief parents way construed unconstitutional aid religion there first amendment violation district court’s judgment affirmed as section 1  only income less 500000 would make choice the purpose course simply see get double benefit thats true that i assume would true well  well  income 2400000 year cannot take  you cannot take tax relief income 500000 cannot take tuition reimbursement yes i would assume that would  i would think would yes goes progressively yes and apparently assumed income 2400000 afford send children nonpublic schools without needing tax relief i sure parents would disagree that legislative philosophy behind getting section 1 statute socalled health safety grants legislature specifically found financial crisis non public schools low income areas resulted deferred maintenance repair programs also resulted increase health safety hazards children attending schools hereto district court case found conditions problems set forth legislative findings valid expressed secular legislative intent the bill provides mr pfeffer said specific dollar amounts per pupil additional dollar amount pupils attending schools buildings constructed prior 1947 would paid schools partial reimbursement prior expenditures repairs maintenance the expenditure money submit safeguard two ways first amount may exceed 50 state wide average cost maintenance repair public schools may exceed actual amount paid nonpublic school preceding base year further nonpublic schools qualified grants program only schools qualify certified serving high concentration low income pupils purposes title iv federal higher education act 1965 title iv involves specific grants teacher read teach educational purposes persons educational institutions preparing teaching agree teach low income areas the schools involved approximately 250 1400 non public schools state new york in perspective must observe court never held direct payments nonpublic schools unconstitutional now must also state long tradition federal well state aid nonpublic schools form special benefits direct payments either schools students to use example school lunch program tax exemptions gi bill rights programs benefits federal elementary secondary education act 1965 we cite many instances brief appeal it must assumed payments benefits provided considered aid religion rather public secular purpose the statute issue submit adopted exercise state’s police power protect health safety children state contrary argument mr pfeffer seem advance consider complete court’s decisions ever considered police power directly related normally consider crime policing police power purpose activity various fields health safety far beyond normal criminal justice system the latitude inscribed police power courts great this court indeed held state sovereign right protect welfare people and cases cited brief relate regulatory statutes adopted exercise police power submit essential legal constitutional difference statutes regulate statutes provide money accomplish desired police power purpose in fact everson case mr pfeffer said submit supports this court everson upheld bus transportation basis police power measure designed get children safely nonpublic schools protect hazards court said either hitchhiking walking highrise yes your honor thats correct statement i would think violate first amendment inaudible well i think respect purpose statute it police power statute it  intended benefit religious schools it intended benefit religion intended benefit schools essentially institutions it intended exercise police power protect health safety children state’s citizen children attending non public schools no i think get all right well advance police power i think  demonstrate secular intent legislative purpose contrary mr pfeffer’s argument see language first amendment direct prohibition aid parochial schools i would think could least contribute money rehabilitate structure the state terms schools no i dont think go  i dont think goes far saying trying protect safety children buildings attend now building case condemned torn could rehabilitated to extent question safety children building attending that would  thats different question i would think i think difference one state’s interest protecting children state acts different plain certainly adults would attending seminary where taught religion i would think talking  talking  well limits police power extent i suppose would say money would going directly aid religion school taught religion here talking schools mean things  no i dont think get i dont think halfnhalf 4060 i think question state is relating children attend schools meet requirements secular education state takes interest state interest relating education i think thats whole reason its enforcement compulsory attendance compulsory attendance law say whether student goes school particular day precisely case state’s interest students right go nonpublic schools purpose complying compulsory education law purpose attending nonpublic schools purpose getting secular education extent state  power supervision schools also right get issue health safety structures attend to extent say  primary intent affect statute aid religion violate first amendment health safety grants also complies constitutional mandate intent first amendment briefly i like mention tuition reimbursement portion statute it  its part two section 2 statute yes first tuition reimbursement provides payment low income parents lesser two amounts either 50 tuition paid nonpublic school 5000 per child per year elementary school 10000 secondary school lesser two amounts we say equivalent  public measures enable parents  state participates assistance low income indigent parents indigent persons before lunch justice stewart asked question concerning adc payments new york state court may aware flat grant system payment adc welfare recipients prior time prior time flat grant system introduced categorical grants various things rent heat food allowances clothing allowances forth state education law required payments educational expenses children interpreted include tuition nonpublic schools also expenses books clothes would include uniforms nonpublic schools educational supplies forth and since flat grant option pressure increased upon legislature benefit low income parents directly related fact longer getting assistance past purpose tuition reimbursement well expenses children attending nonpublic schools along additional feeling within legislature  since low income parents well upper income parents constitutional right send children non public schools deprived right solely lack income we equated degree welfare system provision low income housing state’s provision certain benefits way transcripts administrative hearings forth persons low income poverty stricken to extent submit low income portion statute intended benefit schools paid parents long tuition paid it  used conduit payment schools there direct aid schools indirect aid results fact attendance nonpublic schools may made easier children benefit court held constitute unconstitutional aid religion no appropriation periodically all money paid state treasury subject appropriation annually annually no purpose effect state constitutional provision prohibits payment state treasury unless specific appropriation yes yes extent the school must course comply state’s compulsory education law it may discriminate basis race may discriminate basis religion except  religiously oriented school religious denomination in words catholic school determines accept noncatholics could discriminate groups noncatholics so limitation yes persons religion yes would would true its something statute looks the statutory enactment concerned requirements school would  type school parent determines send child would permissible the prohibition racial discrimination i said discrimination religion school we covered i think issue severability statute brief i believe part argument ,426.0,596,36,is limit mrs coon are going address precise manner new york tax  portion statute dealing tax operates it came knowing question mr pfeffer’s argument whether credit deduction exclusion going address precise manner operates the credit different its forgiveness owe government   set its like paying money directly but isnt if pay 300 tuition new york plan dont get 300 deduction income no so deduction term generally understood tax law but tax credit reduction amount money owe government directly thats credit well isnt close exemption get dependents federal income tax return isnt closest analogy yes  exemption comes  serves reduce taxable income extend like deduction i thought gear operate actually reduce taxes directly well maybe youll expand justice rehnquist suggested earlier question and thats true credit a forgiveness part owe taxes this like box goes many exemptions this would like another box right but flat amount thats right yes and would level on returns but thats theory income 5000 500 its appropriate day discussing so   deduction exemption deduction  differential effect depending much money make is query papers tax form shows us works that might helpful us i suggest copies firms would submit illustrations works might helpful was choice personally made fact people getting  well person  i suppose person could little income get benefit creditors true which would take provision would possibly true much income does function point way medical deduction federal analogy i sure i followed none you eligible tuition relief income 500000 correct or i take chances income 500000 would tax pay anyway and i expect provision  reimbursement extent   people 500000 the 500000 simply wouldnt work 500000 but deduction  deduction exemption whatever call credit whatever call go progressively 24 yes progressively ends 24 well really doesnt answer problem though if valid exercise police power means got first conclude doesnt violate first amendment doesnt violate first amendment valid exercise police power well justice rehnquist said might perfectly valid exercise state’s reserve power police power power companiously known police power so far due process clause goes something like that doesnt  begs question whether violates first amendment doesn’t first fourteenth amendment well pursue moment it might perfectly valid applied secular school private nondenominational school i take mr pfeffer would question state decided make grants it runs afoul first amendment justice stewart justice rehnquist suggested runs afoul soon bring  introduce element well example mrs coon school building condemned bad state repair it condemned hazardous health safety stairways it fire hazard lot things in view could state new york contribute money build new building exercise police power thats case i speaking new building could say condemn we’ll tear we’re going put new building state new york pay you think could well suppose found seminary  seminaries complete need rehabilitation findings made elementary high school would say state could contribute suppose found church schools need rehabilitation taught religion would right huh huh so first amendment limit police power but don’t let get halfnhalf 4060 now i think  well interest  interest state supervising private schools state’s reason enforcement compulsory attendance law what reason state supervise schools and thats state’s  that part two it  mrs coon  new york system government appropriation periodically law enacted automatically  was biannually or annually and law isnt self executing point view financing an annual appropriation mrs coon certain limitation finds parochial school does fit new york it may still program even though limits

Regan,94 ORIG,434178000.0,446277600.0,South Carolina,Regan,9.0,0.0,1,1219.0,1441,7,mr chief justice may please court south carolina morning responds leave granted court argue court take original jurisdiction dispose case seeks bring secretary treasury since inception south carolina joined perhaps 27 states reason move court the court granted permission divide argument i thus yield ten minutes argument assistant attorney general texas she stress financial burdens result states account provision law the solicitor general suggested brief i think footnote since case clearly lacks merit court dismiss grant relief i think necessitates comment true issues involved this case really historic background in 1894 congress inacted income tax law broad widesweeping it included provision taxing interest notes bonds whatever nature except bonds united states terms issuance exempt taxation that produced famous litigation pollock farmers loan trust company twice heard court at times unanimous nature federal system prevented imposition tax interest state bonds however holding respect lack power impose excise tax interest dividends rents law declared declared unconstitutional five four pollock really resulted adoption 16th amendment now time pollock 1982 enactment tefra congress conceded although done originally mr cordell hull chairman ways means committee 1913 fact interest state bonds immune taxation tefra see direct challenge and meanwhile court never precisely question repeatedly said time time doctrine reciprocal immunity essential federal system resulted freedom taxation interest state bonds that lasted 1982 tefra challenges meaning 16th amendment announced court although technically i suppose pronouncements dicta they pronounced many times seemed work body tradition law and challenged must argue 16th amendment permits tax we dont think the solicitor general urged court take jurisdiction case despite fact second clause second section article iii constitution specifically grants court original jurisdiction actions involve state citizen another state what course seek injunction secretary treasurer traditional fashion enjoining officer united states performing acting unconstitutional statute thus performing illegal act i think marbury madison got court way mr sinkler i ask one question surely you left merits going injunction act in view would congress power pass statute said bonds traded interstate market must registered form including issued state without taxation penalty i dont think i think invasion states right i think maybe case might get your determination might rest balancing equities traditional commerce clause involved whereas taxation clause power involved really question reciprocal immunity one really goes nature federal system but would lesser burden greater burden state one avoid tax selling i think meet burdens sir you i think meet burdens show for instance south carolina sold 65 million bonds september 13 deliver new york next week we normally pay paying agent services issue 65 million i think we figure 85000 the cost paying registered issuing registered bonds now terribly expensive the cost arranging transfers arranging checks go estimate morgan bank fiscal agent bond registrar cost issue average life 11 years extends 00 385000 south carolina additional cost oh i think 310000 it happens south carolina approximately debt 600 million state treasurer structured debt shortterm basis able come back trough frequently well assuming 650 million really added costs neighborhood 3 million that good deal money are saying federal government may impose regulation issuance bonds imposes cost state you say require printed english certain disclosures like i think really i dont think federal government going traditional federal system espoused really far back weston city charleston said time doctrine immunities springs union states national government i realize also justify supremacy act i think several members court made statement i quarrel certainly far reciprocal immunity granted states results nature compact there provision constitution united states effect as matter fact case course went south carolina constitutional court four three decision majority said nothing constitution united states says cant the dissenting judges said nature system makes impossible state tax obligation federal government i thought interest rate comment marvelous even though congress provide money lent ten percent states tax treasury united states powerless borrow and see burden takes place according chief justice marshall existence creates burden contract sensible impact interest influence contract and furthermore one government control provisions actions another government obviously type governmental interference i personally believe federal system precludes of course doctrine intergovernmental immunity kind reached high point 1870s 1880s courts cases 30s rather drastically cut back especially states concerned i think i think got good distinction take instance famous people really affected case chief justice hughes wilcutts bunn reaffirms points difference imposing tax capital gains interest bonds one transaction the transaction state lender finished totally new transaction results part acumen person bought bonds did case involve intergovernmental immunities he quotes weston reaffirms everything ive i said of course governor hughes started great debate message as governor message general assembly new york january 1910 produced language 16th amendment came focus there great debate joined senator bora senator elihu root president taft basis apparent success persuading public 16th amendment adopted hughes twice took curtain call scene he justice case brushaber union pracific first case following adoption 16th amendment held merely sought accomplish pollock denied right tax rents interest income hughes course writing willcutts bunns chief justice reaffirms what federal taxation salaries state employees well taxes paid individual employee it nondiscriminatory tax widespread affect this honorable court held affect well i suppose might increase states cost labor force i think probably might incidental cost court saw fit declare suppose government instead speaking registered bonds subjected income taxation interest state bonds well and course tax would paid holders bonds let suggest the taxes paid state fact tax makes state pay tax now sold bonds choice taking issuing coupon bonds that would ridiculous we couldnt get market we obviously sell fully registered bonds i provide proceedings litigation resulted way i hope would might later issue coupon bonds practical standpoint issued bonds i think difference cost state south carolina 65 million issue we paid 81 i think would run perhaps 11 i comparing south carolinas aaa credit ibm aaa credit ibm obviously so think south carolina paying increased interest equivalent tax burden holder yes pay we obviously pay there question the market would demand otherwise people dont buy state bonds they looking net interest cost that carefully calculated now tefra also put provision limited deduction banks might take borrowed money i suppose bank money borrowed money when came calculate income tax included 15  taxexempt interest now challenged i think court could levy tax without the congress could levy tax without exemptions i think totally different situation but immediately 15  went effect rates adjusted major banks ended issue paying additional tax it inevitable there possible way issue escape tax but i think even worse consequences consequences congress taking local affairs government mr chief justice please court i would like suggest court consequences permitting national government inject issuance state bonds i talking state bonds issued state purposes i talking industrial revenue type bonds if congress tell south carolina got issue revenue bonds tell south carolina issue bonds certain kind issues bonds must issue different kind bond you really going move seat government local capitals washington look internal revenue act section 103 two lines started sort esoteric type borrowing you find 15 pages hundreds pages regulations that going let camel put nose tent tell states should issue bonds issue bonds i talking state bonds state public purposes your honors mr sinkler may i ask i dont think suggested response governments argument the tax injunction act bars courts jurisdiction suit excuse sir i dont think addressed governments argument tax injunction act bars courts jurisdiction suit well first place your honor i think case involves something great deal tax this referred joint committee reports sanction tax provision but matter court take jurisdiction case really involves right national government impose upon governments states it fundamental question also boldly announced i didnt think going boldly announced i thought would try get away 16th amendment prevents federal government tax state bonds overrules certainly dicta court 60 years now mr sinkler grant motion leave file appoint special master not sir the facts facts the basic question intrusion well agree what juncture we havent granted leave file yet i think ought let us file motion then and fight briefs argument i would assume you mean arguments merits havent presented i think considerable number arguments i think court would find interested history whole problem case really goes but going wouldnt want opportunity support factual obligations burdens state maybe federal government would want i would objection testimony respect kind basis requiring registered bonds we certainly would objection your honor there happens half trillion dollars coupon bonds outstanding covered thing yes so result government seeks going come probably great many years mr sinkler asked preliminary injunction i thought i denied your honor so case i denied i didnt know anything appealing that right sir,43.0,48,3,we hear arguments first morning south carolina secretary regan mr sinkler may proceed whenever ready ms voss you renew motion right i suppose laughter you take without master right if take jurisdiction dont care whether master thank counsel the case submitted we hear arguments next russello united states,1796.0,1807,8,mr chief justice may please court let say straight away lest contrary impression given concentration jurisdictional obstacles court entertaining case least shy reaching merits if court concludes contrary submission antiinjunction act barrier reluctant meet south carolinas constitutional challenge and court required hear case secretary content merits decided indeed submit said constitutionality statute sufficiently clear court could properly dispose case stage motion leave file after and involved indirect indirect requirement obligations extend year matter issued whether united states corporations states municipalities issued general public shall registered form now sense discriminatory it mildest intrusion states sovereignty it seems us far less requirements sustained instance withholding income tax state employees what governments interest mr claiborne congress determined basis elaborate hearings evidence bonds one common means device avoiding gift tax estate tax capital gains tax exchange bonds moreover illegally obtained monies finally right add theft interstate transportation stolen securities facilitated bonds bearer rather registered form those considerations bear plain powers congress inferred article i fully justify federal interest enacting statute since i old enough remember registered bonds rather frequently encountered disappeared years certainly cant much federal government interest getting tax quite candidly justice blackmun revenue agency measure it revenue aspect it exercise taxing power necessary proper means attempt diminish tax evasion tax avoidance in sense exercise taxing power but object exercise raise additional taxes except government congress retreat withholding interest dividends makes argument sound rather hollow doesnt it may tension two contradictory actions congress defending portion legislation pass degree least avoids otherwise determined common way avoiding i say gift estate taxes also capital gains taxes now burden imposed states result surely less burden imposed many federal regulations including one i mentioned requirement withholding and costs additional costs imposed states attempted produce counter affidavits fair surmise would offsetting economies area insurance handling course statute require bonds though issued registered form issued certificates if burden factual matter suggesting ought surmise would offsetting benefits really doesnt dispense necessity sort inquiry a factual factual question burden play part deciding case quite justice rehnquist though i take justice oconnors point exact degree burden constitutionally relevant long plain exercise power congress article i even accepting allegations plaintiff states impermissible burden imposed power state south carolina raise revenues this simply question form revenue shall raised it attempt tax interest state municipal bonds and course sense prohibition inhibition states power raise monies we would answer justice stevens question whether statute form tax simply uniform requirement imposed issuers obligations certain character registered form we would defend statute way one mr claiborne may i ask decision grant motion leave file would necessary appoint special master we would say would say reasons i suggested invoking justice oconnors comment it may court feel degree burden justice rehnquist suggests matter question whether indeed offsetting economies one appropriately requires hearing evidence event master but would inquiry need made as i see justice brennan that potential question master might able take evidence help court toward mr claiborne federal government authority withdraw altogether tax exemption income state municipal bonds justice powell would say yes the government authority we allege yes we think necessary court reach question case but limiting principle well contrary position united states cannot deny exemption state municipal obligations altogether must limit we would say doesnt approach limit since doesnt deny exemption registered bonds merely requires order earn exemptions bonds issued in form but matter which traditional form it exceptional requirement could federal government done rest public start low income tax state municipal securities gradually move justice powell i havent opportunity consider question i would suppose power tax abused amounts destroying states raise revenue court said sit assure that limit reached what limit the power tax limited 10th amendment the power tax may limited eliminated 10th amendment mr claiborne dont concede tax state it tax bond holders it tax bond interest i assuming purpose answering justice powell states immunity run bond holder otherwise question limitation now invoked jurisdictional barriers courts entertaining case done deemed duty bring courts attention seemed us plain obstacles reaching merits case it principle court decide lacks jurisdiction decide ought decided prematurely principle importance result given case it important maintenance court system and instance important governments interest it familiar things salutary tax system rule embodied statute hundred years suit lie enjoin collection taxes and indeed states i dont know whether true respect south carolina texas general rule states light rule respect enjoining collection taxes mr claiborne position power congress limit courts jurisdiction somewhat contrary marbury versus madison we justice oconnor view contradiction dictum marbury versus madison seems us simply procedural limitation court court may entertain action kind it common ground i take statute limitations governs court exercise original jurisdiction governs every court can congress limit remedies court provide exercise jurisdiction original jurisdiction we would say yes justice oconnor least long rule uniform nondiscriminatory court simply rule procedure announces injunction appropriate for instance by argument congress limit term court sit establish filing fees would determine cases could taken not cases could taken terms classes cases my impression congress set tone court statute but i assume limits i dont suppose congress could say court shall sit two years i assume hand permissible present law congress may say court shall begin new term first monday october if correct jurisdictional point way south carolina could get hearing question court it preventing south carolina testing issue issuing bonds albeit may bonds may issued order find purchasers abnormally high rate interest but wish press matter obviously available way done it need large issue well purchaser would file suit south carolina indeed but bar purchaser either challenging deficiency tax court failed pay interest issue bonds holds refund suit district court claims court but whether end days practical matter occasion test constitutionality statute reason court presently entertain suit this court ought driven take jurisdiction seems us entirely backwards congress interest sparing courts burdened docket given concurrent jurisdiction case kind district courts south carolina would suggest antiinjunction statute bars district court entertaining suit bounced back court court courts ought less hospitable litigation district courts whose primary role entertain original cases well goes proper use discretion court whether accept dont think you arguing instead court cannot accept justice oconnor i argue i say legislative bar imposed antiinjunction act like legislative bar imposed statute limitations like legislative bar imposed norrislaguardia act turn supplied courts united states one apply hence prevents district court hearing case likewise prevents court this court however may choose determine issue may matter discretion eye congressional policy determine inappropriate court business courts prevented obedience legislative policy longstanding obvious salutary reasons behind and therefore matter discretion matter necessity court ought decline entertain action mr claiborne considered case allen regents university georgia connection argument whether isnt response ought deal justice stevens i aware case relevant present case i take however way dealt courts opinion bob jones case indicates courts view longer good law case based beechnut case courts terms eroded scuttled antiinjunction act in allen five three decision point court felt constrained allow original suit concede antiinjunction action bar suit challenge requirement university collect amusement tax tickets sold football games and may comparable case but seem us that circumvention antiinjunction statute importantly seems us court treated current opinion bob jones university versus simon indeed companion case the argument way put eloquently could americans united case dissenting opinion justice blackmun but view prevail seems us that view precisely view embraced court allen case let say one final thing respect question marbury versus madison argument seeming contradiction marbury versus madison course holds congress cannot add courts original jurisdiction indeed argument could made therefore invoking declaratory judgment act would adding jurisdiction court sense we would make argument and vein would hear say antiinjunction action statute takes away courts jurisdiction it simply instructs courts united states may hear controversy controversies may hear and cannot different whether rule late hear case statute limitations soon hear mr claiborne could court ever hear appeal case south carolina party connection task cant hear there could case south carolina plaintiff often true the reason south carolina well saying south carolina could never adjudication court instance well respect particular issue i think south carolina course need sit tarry sidelines taxpayer files refund suit if taxpayer ever as taxpayer going getting higher interest rates got stake well would soon pocket higher interest rate rather pay half treasury well i know hire lawyer getting less bonds ever only south carolina getting less bonds well may precisely argument justice blackmun made americans united suit might never come organization among things might change activity contributor wouldnt find worthwhile hiring lawyer going cost delays filing suit court said reason break rule antiinjunction statute well state party that wasnt involved bob jones case i appreciate state claim state different ordinary party of course respect ordinary taxpayers must happen every day people would engage certain commercial transaction assured tax consequences able obtain declaration court advance able obtain favorable revenue ruling simply demur engage transaction matter never tested judicially that reason allow advance declaratory injunctive action and seems us reasoning must apply case after original jurisdiction court afforded states order available forum thought equal sovereign dignity but forum meant open hospitable forum equally available states is withholding interest bonds issued private issuers my impression that statute repealed presently law so south carolina would obligation file withholding statements report government much interest paying people i think one final thing score the recent amicus brief filed i confident whether court granted leave file suggests alternative statute requirement issuers paying agent report bearer bonds delivered keep records payments interest thereby furnish trail federal revenue officers satisfy attempted avoidance evasion tax i frankly baffled different conceding requirements would proper challenging straightforward requirement bonds issued registered form issue we submit court ought grant leave file matter antiinjunction statute applicable elsewhere court cannot entertain suit it mr claiborne i sorry finish sentence but merits appropriately reached sufficiently clear suit dismissed stage mr claiborne i wanted go back moment allen case sure i understand submission i glance opinion court case rely extent fact state interest involved university georgia board regents university georgia speaking behalf state extent rely bob jones effect repudiating rationale case really couldnt repudiate aspect case so maybe least survived person seeking bring litigation state opposed private university something like well i perhaps missed passage your honor refers allen case i appreciated court felt state rather ordinary taxpayer antiinjunction statute prohibition ought relaxed that fact though case it indeed and i may read much it isnt clear might i suggesting misread but really response case case almost exclusively bob jones undermined well case wrongly decided bob jones indicates the reasoning allen totally inconsistent reasoning bob jones isnt well exactly justice rehnquist i cannot reconcile i dont think court attempted simon but court clearly repudiated case allen turn relying mentioned allen simply following erroneous view and case terms overruled i take holdings effectively eroded i submit,0.0,3,1,do anything further,388.0,475,2,mr chief justice may please court an immeasurable heavy financial burden put key sovereign operations states enactment particular section tefra dubious benefit treasury enforcing prevention tax evasion moreover solicitor general suggested brief tax exemption municipal bonds matter constitutional right debatable proposition my portion argument try show financial consequences effects two propositions appeal courts original jurisdiction necessary protection states ms voss many things federal government way congressional regulatory requirements end costing states lot money so financial burden alone support argument this particular financial burden goes basic premise constitution federalism something guaranteed states since constitution law started you trace back mccullough versus maryland wanted but day law effect in texas alone least one issuer going market paying somewhere 5000 14000 registrar fees didnt pay year now talking one 3395 texas issuers goes market one time 17 million annually additional registrar costs these costs issuers bear there 47000 municipal issuers country and registrar costs hit little issuers lot harder hit big issuers one big guys like university texas doesnt really usually go market less 20 million time going pay lower registrar fees little school district barely issue tax base maybe 1 million renovate 60year old schoolhouse and figures represent registrar fees additional attorneys fee extra additional costs documentation extra registrar fees even include postage mailing interest checks and income oil wells i beg pardon and income oil wells university texas well permanent university fund money but talking financial burden alone it financial burden going help cripple ability issuers perform governmental functions you talking jail as many probably know texas probably five inmates cell meant hold two federal court order improve conditions general voss could i ask yes supposing federal government regulations kind disclosures borrower make issues bonds say file registration statement tell financially solvent sort thing costly hire accountants prepare statement could require state issuer comply rules kind think as matter marketing bonds state issuers presently comply sorts requirements no assume could federal government compel say could change make burdensome without violating that particular issue never challenged constitutionality the states complying marketing matter i serious questions constitutionality it seems argument would apply well you basically arguing power federal government impose burden whatsoever upon state issuing bonds rather extreme position but position i take yes sir when something like jail renovations required done money replace school burned increased cost issuance bonds probably school burned knew needed fire house didnt money cost issuance sewage treatment plant you talking serious problems and removal income tax exemption altogether going foreclose many issuers market place completely the attraction paper market place right taxexempt feature of course dont decide case whether federal government power tax income municipal bonds no sir south carolina made appropriate call real party interest jurisdiction court constitutionally provided simply inconceivable act congress could deprive

the ninth circuits fobian rule creates unwarranted federal common law rule exists outside structure bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code distinct structure for example debtor right attorneys fees valid state law petition date date debtor files bankruptcy right passes bankruptcy estate if creditor state law right attorneys fees petition date right becomes claim bankruptcy the ninth circuits fobian rule intercepts rights even get bankruptcy code provides basically says youre litigating federal issues simply cannot right attorneys fees unless federal law authorizes right case contractual rights alternatively rights available state statute that submit impermissible creation federal common law rule there basis courts preemption precedents theres conflict federal policy state policy would justify creation rule accordingly unwarranted it depends justice kennedy it depends contractual right provides here contractual then yes justice kennedy i would say probably would covered it probably would covered analysis yes justice kennedy in reply brief cite collier talk exactly scenario described and basically works like a claim bankruptcy code defined section 1015 the claim includes right payment whether contingent fixed matured unmatured et cetera any right payment literally right payment debtor files bankruptcy becomes claim if right yes justice kennedy the key concept explained clearly collier right come if arises prepetition contract right prepetition nature even though fees incurred postpetition think guarantee think pge guaranteed parents debt 100 million lets say right exactly yes justice stevens fact though creditor bothers assert claim fees bankruptcy case in cases creditors dont worth effort asserting claim fees subsequently in cases solvent debtor pay claims full theres reason able get contractual obligations bankruptcy well theres transaction cost actually filing additional claim setting forth amount youve incurred in cases justice stevens creditors dont even hire attorneys pursue file claim bankruptcy in chapter 7 cases example noasset cases normally theres distribution unsecured claims bankruptcy cases so bother typically justice stevens correct but cases attorneys fees substantial debtor solvent substantial for work done performing filing proof claim thats correct and even though justice kennedy attorneys conduct debtor filed bankruptcy right payment arises prepetition contract again think guarantee hypothetical there thats correct justice stevens but think prepetition tort claim exposure asbestos products prepetition injury arises postpetition its still prepetition claim justice souter different sense this indemnity allloss indemnity provision the surety supposed incur loss cost whatsoever supplying surety bonds pge but pge filed bankruptcy justice souter visualize bankruptcy default when debtor files bankruptcy must come bankruptcy court present rights yes sir well analogy justice souter ltv case posture beginning case we dont know whats going happen future you must file claim beginning case in ltv but thats precisely point claim defined broadly include contingent claims absolutely false justice souter in bankruptcy present rights rights workers properly treated lost under section 1141 extinguished no justice souter look section 1141 bankruptcy code provides plan reorganization binds parties if youre provided adequately plan section 1141d rights extinguished forever you must come bankruptcy court must sure rights properly characterized excuse yes justice ginsburg i think need distinguish two different things there work performed preserving rights injured employees make sure properly classified rights rendered unimpaired if hadnt plan rights would extinguished section 1141 then claim surety provides done work the problem justice ginsburg plan said nothing and plan says nothing default rule bankruptcy rights extinguished discharged section 1141d it must plan order invalid confirmation plan we assure rights properly treated plan werent would discharged general general discharge provision that one must come bankruptcy court one must file proof claim one must enforce rights bankruptcy dont lose thats surety stepped forward said subrogation rights workers rights and bankruptcy court agreed travelers it directed debtor put language plan travelers thats section 509 justice ginsburg but thats i speaking momentarily the rights injured employees workers filed pge filed bankruptcy injured workers claims they going receive periodic benefit payments future if pge properly provided claims bankruptcy case plan claims would extinguished as result though travelers would hook surety bond travelers would stepped forward make payments pge but travelers hadnt come bankruptcy court said rights need preserved recourse pge would extinguished well if one come bankruptcy court assert ones rights one loses and course creditors assert rights incur attorneys fees and prepetition contract said whatever loss incur including attorneys fees right recover right payment that becomes claim we would done work no justice souter injured worker would done well respect the treatment workers plan with respect yes justice souter yes justice souter we would said proof claim if must make payment future entitled two things one entitled reimbursement pge amount must spend future whenever might occur two pay employees subrogated we stand shoes employees may assert rights the subrogation right would fully protected though justice souter treatment workers plan rendering unimpaired we would left simply simply saying reimbursement rights would case make payment now ltv case cite papers beginning ltv case surety 40 million surety bonds position much case pge filed pge got order authorizing continue pay requiring pay that done plan reorganization ltv started paying workers comp benefits defaulted stopped long bankruptcy case commenced far short concluded the surety step plate make payments if surety filed proof claim beginning case surety would lost recourse debtor ltv even though subsequently far later make payment thats bankruptcy works no justice ginsburg there bar date set beginning chapter 11 cases you must file claim bar date youll forever barred even liability becomes fixed later yes justice ginsburg reimbursement claim contingent disallowed subject reconsideration section 502j and thats parties stipulated case stipulation we filed proof claim pge objected proof claim justice ginsburg pge lot object contingent reimbursement rights they mischaracterized subrogation rights claims sought disallow subrogation claims sought subordinate claims plus addition sought disallow claims injured workers so respond litigation commenced we defend rights successful the workers claims ultimately left unimpaired bankruptcy pge fully responsible paying workers claims correct justice ginsburg the fobian rule submit impermissible creation federal common law its justified concept preemption conflict bankruptcy policy it depends justice kennedy if state law unsecured claim section 501b1 in case would determination state law every state your honor reasonableness requirement yes justice kennedy under section 501b1 if state law provides states the bankruptcy court adopts state reasonableness standard unsecured claims section 502b1 yes justice breyer the security and absolutely justice breyer justice breyer happens time in brief cite many many cases attorneys fees allowed unsecured claims its actually happening 100 years happened bankruptcy act 1998 correct your honor correct your honor and key case cited second circuits decision united manufacturers merchants didnt even hire attorney bankruptcy case filed attorney performed services filing proof claim protecting equitable rights second circuit clearly held attorneys fees properly part unsecured claim couldnt clearer and second circuit there justice stevens lower court decisions well compared court certainly justice stevens justice stevens i think important say alternative rule pge asked one every court appeals addressed rejected what saying oh cant get attorneys fees based construction bankruptcy code no court appeals accepted there lower bankruptcy court decisions accepted routinely overturned appeal the issue whether get attorneys fees part unsecured claim cohen versus de la cruz case court construe whether term debt means bankruptcy code thing claim defined liability claim court court concluded that debt included attorneys fees treble damages whole nine yards well chief justice roberts thats correct and view court deal fobian rule and alternative argument respondent presented never argued decided presented opposition certiorari its rejected every single court appeals yes justice ginsburg and thats exactly court it remand statutory interpretation argument court appeals consider lower courts consider this court deserves 20page reply brief response 80 pages briefing side issue never raised presented opposition certiorari remand would proper thing respect claim i believe true justice ginsburg the contract reasonableness issues the circuit split presented court i understand certiorari well im guessing certiorari granted deals fobian rule as common law rule sort construct youre litigating federal law issues well matter general federal common law cant get attorneys fees unless authorized federal law and brief entirely devoted you cant justify rule view preemption principles theres conflict congress preempting field way cant justify atherton a something thats necessary conflict federal policy and also fobian rule inappropriately categorical violation submit courts principles nolan case cf i case in cases court said its courts create claims processing rules bankruptcy but exactly ninth circuit if questions id like reserve balance time rebuttal yes justice stevens that would appropriate remand i reserve balance time thank justice breyer brief pages 25 26 cite number cases courts allowed attorneys fees unsecured claim prepetition work done also postpetition work done contractual right prepetitioned we also cite bunch cases around page 44 43 44 brief including article middle page 44 quote in cases decided bankruptcy act higher courts consistently held attorneys fees allowable even unsecured claims bankruptcy  close quote ive bankruptcy lawyer 20 years ive teaching bankruptcy law 17 years it absolutely true courts routinely disallow claims attorneys fees part unsecured claims its opposite true routine allowed practical reality however presented creditors dont bother present distributions generally low bankruptcy on point plan completely protected rights injured workers nothing could farther truth the provision counsel cites plan refers exec executory contracts workers compensation benefit programs those contractual relationships pge administrators claims workers tellingly pge never argued bankruptcy court claims workers fine plan in fact said travelers wants bankruptcy court directed transcript that appropriate thing in fact travelers insisted required section 1123 bankruptcy code claims workers must classified treatment must specified if they eliminated the reference executory contracts clearly doesnt apply as explain reply brief workers claims executory contracts applicable law that section apply of course i think chief justice roberts lot would like say alternative arguments able put 20page reply brief the issue raised fully ventilated lower courts in fact many things would say remand i also think important point justice stevens solvent debtor concept absolute priority shareholders allowed recover anything unless creditors paid full what trying theyre trying get rid contractual obligations bankruptcy benefit shareholders theres implication creditors creditors recoveries case one versus in dow corning case cite reply brief sixth circuit expressly held solvent debtor pay attorneys fees that additional argument would develop remand but arguments section 506 interpretation 502 simply dont matter solvent debtor theyre entitled take advantage theory even valid and contend isnt valid the court appeals resoundingly rejected the second circuit rejected united merchants manufacturers the sixth circuit rejected dow corning the eleventh circuit en banc wellsville case all considered 506 argument theyre making rejected properly counsel cites section 502b4 thats important section demonstrates congress understood attorneys fees would allowable unsecured claim section 502 and section 502b4 provided exception one attorneys fees would allowable unsecured claim it provided expressly attorneys fees would allowable attorney debtor extent claim fees exceeded reasonable value services performed why provision because congress saw problem there problem debtors sending money attorneys congress understood problem remedied congress think problem respect historic practice going 100 years attorneys fees allowed unsecured claims section 502 allows respondents argument section 506b renders section 502b4 superfluous if attorneys fees never allowable part unsecured claim except 506b allows would need section 502b4 in addition respondent overstates office section 506 506 court explained ron pair provides essentially tells us secured creditors get collateral order prepetition amount theres value left value collateral after pay prepetition amount claim add attorneys fees add postpetition add interest their interpretation section 506b would render section 502b2 superfluous under theory oversecured creditors get postpetition interest get interest that already happens justice kennedy in circuits recognize attorneys fees allowed unsecured claims already happens and cause disaster problem its practice 100 years if congress wished change practice would codified bankruptcy code 1979 the fact hasnt perceived problem demonstrates congress wanted leave practice unchanged now happens though justice kennedy creditors dont bother file claims amounts and matters cases matter like case pge case solvent debtor simply trying get contractual relationships and principles absolute priority allowed benefit shareholders creditors paid full and i think important underscore justice kennedy justice stevens i take i take analysis hostility towards attorneys fees allowed bankruptcy and perhaps maybe matter policy start scratch well maybe shouldnt allow attorneys fees allowed bankruptcy maybe shouldnt allow tort claims allowed bankruptcy maybe shouldnt allow certain kinds environmental claims allowed bankruptcy they dont like rule apparently analysis history wrong and cite innumerable cases law review articles demonstrate practice say and policy reasons grounds sort create federal common law rules categorical rules preclusions yes justice stevens the randolph case decided 1903 law changed dramatically since for example 1903 contingent claims provable bankruptcy act that changed 1938 contingent claims became provable bankruptcy act randolph  randolph versus scruggs involved claim custodian custodian assignee took control debtors assets bankruptcy filing now section 503b3e randolph versus scruggs analysis pertains claims assignee treated administrative expense section 503 dealing administrative expenses in randolph interesting fees justice kennedy fees incurred preparing assignment allowed unsecured claim bankruptcy case justice holmes court said allowed so fact randolph i think refutes analysis rather supports it,609.0,878,27,well hear argument next 051429 travelers casualty surety company versus pacific gas electric company mr brunstad can tell basic bankruptcy i know i looked couldnt find a standard promissory note provides attorneys fees holder note creditor maker note bankrupt maker note goes bankrupt the holder note gets attorney says file claim bankruptcy and attorney sends bill is attorneys fees attorney fee filing bankruptcy claim recoverable part claim its standard standard attorneys fee provision attorneys fees connection collection note enforcement terms note is something i look collier are millions cases i mean seems fairly rudimentary no but case postpetition action could back second supposing time bankruptcy services performed its postpetition conduct lawyer now case saying routinely lawyer recovers fees bankruptcy case even debtor debtor insolvent and assuming insolvency hypothetical although may fit case well wouldnt worth i know but wouldnt worth effort instead getting 90 note get 95 are telling based experience justice kennedys hypothetical normally fees recovered but assuming cases theres distribution correct im assuming answer justice kennedys question normal practice dont bother enough involved just hypothetical i would think many cases theres going payout promissory note holder note tells attorneys make sure i get claim bankruptcy the attorney files claim and every attorney files claim promissory note entitled fee bankruptcy court filing bankruptcy court the prepetition contract prepetition conduct okay youre one step ahead hasnt effect exposure here isnt certain default note so far know may never default workers comp obligation so contingency much remote contingency why should case fall category promissory note and far know wont well depends totally circular argument the minute filed bankruptcy although default comp obligation client started incurring attorneys fees incurring attorneys fees based default by debtor you call bankruptcy default thats i mean know thats i mean im talking default workers comp obligation there default workers comp obligation intend keep running business reason suppose yes maybe dont claim beginning case i mean thats getting we understand claim note youve got promissory note youre money the claim inevitable in case inevitable claim but defined broadly situation exactly like there default obligation prior getting court 167000 racked legal fees accomplishes absolutely nothing all right case 167000 spent come conclusion i understand that time comes assert right indemnification assert right indemnification oppose if going construe bankruptcy law provide law like maybe something wrong in construction bankruptcy law but thats bankruptcy court thought claim this bankruptcy court said rather critical things and i dont never time plan said going pay workers compensation i thought section code preserved subrogation rights yes lets assume lets assume one recipients comp payments come forward said i object plan i claim comp payments i object plan doesnt provide and the court said youre youre right the plan going include provision comp payments amended plan amended would circumstances would travelers circumstances reason assert claim no i know but would claim would asserted done with respect interest travelers if done would travelers asserted claim what correct im wrong in case i thought contingency claim indemnification allowed becomes fixed time claim made lost im talking 502e1 in case nothing fobian socalled fobian issue whether ninth circuit drew bright line are question let ask fobian i know justice breyer question lets assume youre correct fees allowable can bankruptcy court make determination reasonableness fees in case so bankruptcy judge isnt sure amount looks state law determine amount but bankruptcy court determine reasonableness im sort back justice kennedy started forget id like forget case case seems to case parties argue reasonably whether contract covers kind fee and maybe doesnt unreasonable et cetera but lets take straightforward case its obvious contract collect debt maybe mortgage debt mortgage agreement says attorneys fees paid collection it clearly covers bankruptcy language and must many instances anyway security inadequate and must instances wasnt security and i read collier pointed seems say cases simple creditor status unsecured creditor respect attorneys fees overage secured case whole claim unsecured case so get queue collect prorata share my question i 19 professors side coming tell thats never happened they cant even find instance so isnt isnt havent found instance prepared say never happened and may one exception two something like and i cant im totally puzzled because clear say i follow logic i followed collier after bankrupt people assets explain no but talking attorneys fees services performed bankruptcy proceeding the cost filing claim cost talking bankruptcy judge et cetera but i dont body law side issue isnt yes absolutely the second circuit lower court thats exactly right there cases court speaking precise issue on disagreement among lower courts you would thought one group people ought know thoroughly least view bankruptcy bar and yet briefs there article i could find bankruptcy journal well may briefs isnt question granted cert but would proper remand ninth circuit consider arguments on statutory interpretation contract one quick question i may would one issues open remand construction contract is issue state law whether travelers pays particular services thank counsel mr rosenkranz if prevail cant every attorney represents creditor credit card promissory note providing attorneys fees file something bankruptcy get attorneys fees filing claim its interesting youre course teacher the amicus brief bunch professors different view history youre describing would say word justice holmes opinion scruggs case thank counsel the case submitted,1244.0,1747,24,mr chief justice may please court let begin threshold whether court consider statutory construction argument weve presented the issue statutory your honor fobian rule reaches correct conclusion case your honor correct the problem fobian rule doesnt go far enough presenting preventing creditors requiring creditors pay attorneys fees it valid far covers case rationale ninth circuit in words ninth circuit begin wrong place read statute section 502 is rational predicate issue travelers presenting no your honor no mr chief justice no court ever held fobian rule applies oversecured creditors everyone acknowledges section 506b applies oversecured creditors no your honor everyone absolutely clear fobian extent applies im sorry your honor all bankruptcy practitioners courts clear extent fobian applies applies unsecured creditors but rational predicate courts analysis fobian how know yes your honor i apologize focusing issue travelers focusing whether whether fobian rule certworthy question but rational predicate see travelers brief travelers says fewer dozen times including two point headings read code read code it tell unsecured creditors allowable claim postpetition attorneys fees begin reading code figure whether fobian common law overlay correct so say your honors yes lets read code thats ambush smuggling your honor court appeals decisions precise question case court appeals fobian rule underlay fobian 20 years but three courts appeals we your honor the fobian rule wrong least especially distinction draws state law federal litigation theres one answer question well your honor issue fully ventilated among lower courts yes i understand your honor it would futile argue ninth circuit the ninth circuit would said yes now your honor let add two additional reasons court consider the first fully ventilated lower courts there single argument briefs either side lower court opinion going one way another every argument secondly enormous amount affirmative harm come court simply saying let us conclude ninth circuit wrong disallowing claims logic ninth circuit followed reserve later day open question law section 502b 506b means and harm comes fact overwhelmingly lower courts last 10 years concluded 502b 506b mean unsecured creditors claims if court declares open question your honor would dispute contractual interpretation yes your honor yes your honor thats one logic well your honor congress didnt say congress gave one answer question whether unsecured creditors get attorneys fees allowed postpetition attorneys fees allowed its either yes there onoff switch solvent insolvent creditors within code travelers never argued objection plan confirmation yes your honor absolutely incorrect if look case cite case relies provision code section 726 and section 726 postpetition interest solvent debtors postpetition attorneys fees your honor statement travelers quotes collier proposition dont dispute whether prepetition claim but collier your honor response i urge justice breyer look back colliers absolutely accurate doesnt apply case because your honor statement whether prepetition claim whether claim allowable arguing yes your honor step one is claim no one disputes claim it right payment step two allowable claim the answer code absolutely code says one class creditors gets attorneys fees claims allowed oversecured creditors no your honor your honor congress put 506b code one purpose one purpose allow claims elsewhere allowed doesnt 506b serves purpose 506b says nothing whether claim secured your honor answer 506b say anything whether allowed claim secured it completely silent now accept explain brief much detail accept travelers argument allowed claim first instance therefore furthermore allowed security claim 506a tells 506a tells us allowed claim secured creditor secured claim it still leaves section 506b nothing left now let back underscore any creditor would love get creditors pay attorneys fees tort claimants would love trade creditors would love local tax collectors would love but congress said one category claimants get claim postpetition attorneys fees your honor congress said your honor congress said thing what congress says allowed claim allowed date filing petition that value claim value claim date filing petition at point worth zero postpetition attorneys fees incurred and fact matter may well never occurred drafters code your honor claim it im saying saying contingent claim if strange sort contingency it travelers saying claim contingent claim contingency whether tomorrow morning going pick phone called weil gotshal monitor bankruptcy proceeding but lets assume contingent claim it still disallowed claim congress provided numerous statutory indications i already mentioned 506b congress said attorneys fees available quote extent claim oversecured  now would well your honor i going get timbers underscores proposition timbers focused structure 506 began underscored words underscored extent but let turn your honor timbers structural argument focuses purpose 506b but indications it would odd congress example draft provision 506b purports put postpetition attorneys fees footing postpetition interest intended put different footings its observation court made ron pair moreover congress oblivious existence attorneys fees postpetition there 15 occasions code congress spoke attorneys fees congress intended attorneys fees available enormous class unsecured creditors one would think would hidden definition claim your honor creditors four apply attorneys fees administrative expenses its important point code says adopts age old rule going take money away unsecured creditors give attorneys better youre expanding pot creditors your honor for creditors six apply four administrative yes yes your honor well one that provision travelers cites i apologize appendices 502b4 and 502b4 underscores point 502b4 says im quoting directly code a claim allowed disallowed extent  4 claim services insider attorney claim exceeds reasonable value services  that focused prepetition activities lawyers behalf debtor well yes prepetition claims services provided attorney petition an attorney debtor your honor code clear noteworthy fair enough your honor fair enough your honor my point congress knew attorneys fees wanted huge class unsecured creditors collect attorneys fees postpetition activities wouldnt hidden general definition claim general statement allowability your honor first circuit three courts appeals addressed question dictum extensive dictum so first circuit comes way adams versus zimmerman the second circuit comes also dictum travelers side united merchants and sixth circuit splits baby half reads code way position takes detour another direction your honor didnt come asking court address question travelers put front center they conceded well your honor would made sense us argue fobian wrong trying defend judgment but i concede your honor court discretion decide whether going address believe absolute factual predicate travelers seems im sorry legal predicate travelers seems believe legal predicate saying court case issue ventilating 20 years lot mischief thats exactly absolutely your honor your honor i appreciate i apologize raised cert petition cert opposition simply focused little sliver fobian rule worth courts attention but i understand court needs look forward try figure exactly issues are presented i add statutory question presented deroche case your honor pointed mirror images so whatever court decides statutory construction question 502b court say resolving fobian predicate question and court say may well circumstances creditor say know state law litigation common law right reserve later day question whether exception statutory rule articulating now i want underscore congress important reasons built code coming way disallowing unsecured creditors attorneys fees bear mind sorts fee shifting provisions absolutely ubiquitous they every credit card contract they every bank loan they virtually written contract contract doesnt provide quite often state law statutes allowing unsecured creditors pay lawyers hides unsecured creditors well your honor your honor facts case rule otherwise dont know whether pge would solvent but arguing rule one rule travelers one rule everyone else we arguing rule vast majority cases well your honor answer congress dealt issue decided one gets get line get attorneys fees regardless whether theyre solvent its well your honor weve talking natural way read code disallow attorneys fees im explaining attorneys fees generally disallowed everyone theres exception rule code says ah yes theres insolvent theres solvent debtor rule otherwise im sorry what im saying 502b read time filing petition  says means must mean doesnt apply postpetition attorneys fees especially look 502b lens court timbers rest code 506b attorneys fees yes your honor i disagree colliers i dont think colliers comes one way another particular question that question asked earlier whether claim whether prepetition claim yes your honor that i dont disagree your honor i referring another provision colliers one thats cited reply brief that correct statement application arguing whether prepetition obligation of course prepetition obligation just like prepetition interest excuse postpetition interest prepetition obligation arguing code cancels obligation important reasons equality among unsecured creditors no your honor what colliers talking completely different question he doesnt answer question one way another colliers this completely different discussion completely different section referring setoffs yes your honor there one point 502c tells court supposed contingent claims it supposed either liquidate estimate these strange sort contingency i mentioned earlier 502c your honor its back cert petition appendix page i believe 28 and says either estimate liquidate always date filing petition now date filing petition would impossible estimate without crystal ball your honor is classic contingency what estimate likelihood bathroom fact leak cost expenses put something the bankruptcy estate purpose that would something congress would never wanted thousands thousands unsecured creditors your honor i dont understand surety different contract all contractual creditors want fees the reason havent applying overwhelming majority bankruptcy courts tell you cant overwhelming majority cases saying exactly im saying 502b allow tell looking 506b and reasons congress would wanted it would burdened administration state estate the court would spending time administering claims fees contract mean fees upon fees upon fees would spending administering basic bankruptcy estate your honor response is absolutely wrong the first draft plan see page 28 appendix says explicitly i quote workers compensation programs treated executory contract  treated executory contracts deemed assumed debtor means workers got favorable treatment could gotten these unsecured claims your honor thats argued the bankruptcy court explicitly held otherwise ninth circuit agreed bankruptcy court the bankruptcy court said none interventions reasonably necessary reach excuse advance interests therefore absolutely wrong argue us state law side fobian rule now ask your honor bankruptcy court decision say i would refer court page 24a the cert petition appendix see asterisks missing paragraph right middle opinion that orient court looking first paragraph says first then theres asterisk eliminating paragraph look page 140a 141 joint appendix missing paragraph travelers eliminated filled court summarizes 15page colloquy travelers completely wrong claiming steps reasonably necessary and page 141 orient court see begins second paragraph first thats paragraph the next paragraph refers mr brunstads arguments it says i simply dont  i dont think sort say know thought thief hiding bed clear bed  i dont think risk  and gist 15 pages proceeding joint appendix court methodically demolishes argument travelers presents thank your honor,570.0,868,36,and take one step tell us conceding fobian rule basis statute wrong well say doesnt go far enough i infer say valid far goes im sure i agree counsel fobian rule narrower broader question try present for example applies claims secured creditor attorneys fees secured claim well why doesnt so youre oversecured creditor claim attorneys fees arising solely issues matters federal bankruptcy law fobian rule doesnt prevent well everyone im clear if rational predicate might expected hear opposition certiorari no ambush smuggling sense dont court appeals decision one way question justice ginsburg question im interested do defend fobian rule well isnt proper disposition case send back ninth circuit consider arguments yes court first view know well we court review so matter well aired wait see lower courts said question we dont take first instance i understand fobian rule let ask question your argument depends analogize would agree i take oversecured secured creditor theyd entitled fees but assuming assuming contract provides and thats true reason i suppose doesnt impair rights general creditors if thats isnt argument well client solvent complete answer position they argue reply brief well avoid statement collier no it said prepetition claim creditor incurs attorneys fees postpetition incur postpetition afterwards file petition file claim bankruptcy court exercising protecting prepetition claim included right recover attorneys fees and say thats we contract gave us right attorneys fees the fees prepetitioned nature constituting contingent prepetition obligation became fixed postpetition fees incurred all right now response because then explain well thats 506 order tell bankruptcy courts deal secured claims that doesnt negative inference exclusio unius argument whatever i think misplaced context why doesnt serve purpose saying fees covered security theyll be claims fees would stand together unsecured creditors oversecured security cover interest cover attorneys fees thats function 506 whatever of course exactly whats puzzling but havent gone got so youre pointing far congress said particular class people get attorneys fees security insofar security support it doesnt say word happens attorneys fees security exhausted anybody elses attorneys fees provided contract colliers says get same puzzlement suppose i sell house i make promise ill fix leaks bathroom and lo behold theres leak im bankrupt and im bankrupt floods bathroom no claim it contingent claim and youre saying no its quite unlike situation example timbers 502 disallowance postpetition interest there 502 disallowance attorneys fees well timbers cited chief justice indicates interest section 506 thats i dont i think timbers misleading point well 15 places involve attorneys fees administrative expenses do involve attorneys fees simply unsecured claim attorneys fees whats answer question is answer 11 say collect attorneys fees unsecured claim creditors all right six so six administrative remaining two say creditor collect unsecured debt which two which that seems cut way says disallowed insofar unreasonable course therefore would allowed insofar reasonable no attorney debtor yes i mean dont exactly i driving i quite interested said 11 provisions could look support i wouldnt think support consider concern administrative expenses nobodys asking want unsecured claim concern irrelevant thing counsel brother reply brief said court appeals endorsed theory i earlier told one which one particular so really want us reach decide question thats presented holding court appeals one way the issue if thought fobian rule wrong could said how decide but im wondering maybe dont want answer i mean say fobian wrong everybody agree us but say wrong and say reason wrong cant collect attorneys fees youll delighted and say reason wrong collect attorneys fees regardless theyll delighted and alternative say wrong i mean thats problem thats added complication theres another case ninth circuits based decision case deroche your proposed solution doesnt address issue deroche debtor thats seeking attorneys fees so still decide fobian issue and failure defend means going to decide inadequate record if mentioned opposition certiorari perhaps would granted cert deroche case argument rule decide yes thats facts case isnt correct this adverse i understand facts adverse impact whatsoever unsecured creditor no looking case plenty money pay state law obligation shouldnt ordinary rules contract law apply youre raising provision says absence provision attorneys fees youre relying where provision generally disallows attorneys fees well point disagree collier citation page 9 reply brief well says creditor incurs attorneys fees post petition connection protecting prepetition claim fees prepetition so disagree youre saying particular set prepetition obligations collier i think context must saying get paid money i mean goes next sentence says way despite last sentence dont get money oh words implies i ready whole page ill see although said quoted whole page means way im telling get money sorry ill i think 506b argument i see point i see point i mean youd say well 506b simply repeats 506a sometimes provisions becomes somewhat superfluous somewhat i got point i also point well references now point code thats materials 502c how leaky bathroom i i concerned point kinds attorneys fees contracts everybody get fees filing claim postpetition act huge amount claims pay travelers would tell us though surety different somehow stand shoes pge something well course argument something different general abuse youre describing plan didnt make provision for paying workers comp obligation what response your friend says favorable say claims unimpaired thank counsel mr brunstad eight minutes

whether trial judge discretion trial criminal case order defendant produce relevant portions defense investigators report and specifically referring time defendant offered investigator witness behalf direct testimony investigator called fro specific purpose impeaching government witnesses already testified well really directed witness report he copy report likely although record clear defense counsel clearly copy report time trial report prepared investigator report so really order defense counsel defense witness turnover report this central district california  the central district california trial los angeles apparently occur central district california matter practice thats correct judging transcript case i sincerely doubt our position basically cases like jencks gordon goldman court really support view trial judge kind discretion in absence countervailing legislation rule say none it sort reverse jencks case yes and look back jencks i think anyone would agree jencks  jencks case began premise judges kind discretion purpose congress passing jencks act limit discretion existed it addressed problem requiring government turnover certain things defense concern fishing expeditions national security things sort interest government address problem case congress could address it hasnt submit court hasnt addressed rule 16 either rule 16 pretrial rule really govern trial begins the facts case briefly indicate necessary appropriate judge exercise discretion respondent three others charged federal bank robbery three robbers captured film bank robbery one later identified respondent trial standing surveillance camera one captured film the governments evidence came two eyewitnesses bank teller salesman visiting bank it two eyewitnesses defense tried impeach investigator first crossexamined eyewitnesses asking one whether told investigator hed seen back robber camera the witness denied said the second witness asked whether told investigator blacks lookalike the witness denied said and point prosecutor requested hed able see relevant portions report respondents counsel denied refuse produce the court indicated inclination order produced waited oral argument and later said would order produced investigator testified relevant portions report offer services camera review report excise extraneous matters the court made ruling prior defense investigator called stand said would require production relevant portions direct testimony investigator now earlier  the defense called stand chronologically happened defense prosecution witness hoffman van gamoran testified he asked whether youd interview investigator he said couldnt recall he showing piece paper purporting part investigators report crossexamination  by defense counsel thats right he said piece paper refresh recollection recall saying hed seen back man and fact see back man the second government witness crossexamined whether interview he  recollection refreshed remembered interview he denied made statement blacks lookalike there argument whether prosecutor would able see relevant portion report air redirect government witness hoffman that never produced the government proceeded direct examination there subsequent argument court ruled investigator called purpose relevant portions report would turnedover direct testimony defense counsel respondents counsel apparently conferred members public defenders service concluded fifth amendment privilege reasons sixth amendment privilege turn he voice overlaphe updated mild protest aptly asked yes and defense investigator called stand i believe prosecutor proceed  the defense putting case the government rested motions judgment acquittal defense counsel denied defense put number witnesses prior calling investigator called investigator the prosecutor approach bench said “i would like proffer hes going testify about” defense counsel mr allis made proffer proffer would testify photographs taken bank apparently relating lighting conditions and also would impeach witness hoffman i believe also witness hoffman i believe also witness van gamoran the court said “well earlier ruling still stands turned over” and subsequent argument mr allis indicated would turn felt whether privileges involve court made clear again limited nature ruling entire report relevant parts relating statements may made hoffman van gamorans bond irrelevant  to investigator  thats right limited direct testimony investigator relate interviews witnesses  i think exact jencks limitation yes was  im sorry use reports it clear record whether going use reports refresh recollection stand never developed subject matter going well im sure thats entirely true i think thats i think bigger problem case yes ill attempt solve but i think rules obviously affect and affect july 1st year yes testify alright bench discussing matter judge reiterated ruling made clear limited relevant portions and made clear irrelevancies could excise offered services camera help excision things defense counsel nevertheless refuse turnover portion reports standing privileges yes would turn  thats correct court  point discussion i let testify striking courts well i think rule witness i want know intentions youre officer court and im going preclude testimony say turn thats  ruling court he testified matters witnesses testified jury returns verdict guilty the court appeals reversed twotoone decision and found trial courts order violation fifth amendment privilege also violation rule 16 cs limitation discovery prosecutor defense to trial court material defense investigators report  was  turned trial court i believe seal ive never seen is proffer bond would testify as supplement proffer counsel made oral representation court that fact investigator taken notes prepare report notes interviews two witnesses that counsel court discussing made reference investigators report he said one point fact two reports im sure exactly meant whether one point referring notes another point referring report the investigator testified matters but two witnesses because court ruled counsel refused comply order turnover report would precluded   testifying subject matter and  no i think jencks  well courts court ruled prior taking stand made clear order would apply direct testimony said “after direct testimony must turnover portions report tell whether youre going comply order youre going comply rather im testifying striking i functional equivalent prevent going subject matter all” and i think thing would happen jencks trial judge farsighted enough deal problem exactly his ruling made witness  took stand apply direct testimony witness thats right  thats ordinary jencks procedure well thats right and trial judges order obligation turn completed direct testimony im sure thats true mr justice brennan seems prosecutor make kind statement advance witness called whatever reason doesnt happen much the judge could  i dont think would required let testify strike i  thats right i mean additional sanctions enforced government cannot enforced defense its certainly much lesser sanction dismissing indictment something  well fact 613 didnt govern may govern retrial it position 613 deal precise problem  i think survive 613 look history  well i dont think refreshing recollection precondition trial judge exercising discretion kind circumstance 613  yes 613 originally came court required provide judges discretion said whether refreshing done testifying prior testifying would turned congress modified second one testifying deal contend third situation situation well i dont think i think use purposes crossexamination normal rules evidence would apply if turns prior consistent statement hoffman van gamoran question would whether could introduce buttress testimony turns prior consistent statement investigator question would result and maybe july 1 1975 relate one d would answer question the two questions clearly distinguished i think jencks said i think claremore said i think campbell said production purposes crossexamination the prerequisites show relevant relates direct testimony use sorts purposes omissions report might relevant different order presentation report might relevant whether statement consistent inconsistent would admissible evidence question judge would rule somewhere road nothing directly produce ability usefulness issue testing credibility getting truth think case really and basic position prior decisions court kinds principles apply prosecutor prior statement calls witness made prior statement prior report i would apply defense call witness purpose impeaching government witnesses may interviewed theyve taken statements and  mr nobles defendant or attorney well  i dont think we  fact state cases cite damon saunders montague cases attorneys acted investigators were talking attorneyclient privilege the privilege rule proposed would expanded attorneyclient privilege also encompass representatives attorney passed congress common law privileges prevail and therefore even court appeals said case attorneyclient privilege would protect material secondly submit confidential sense communications covered attorneyclient privilege protection certainly the statements would protected pretrial discover civil action i doubt would protected trial production person made statement report called witness if civil action someone hired representative attorney investigation statistical study whatever else this maybe governed work product rule hickman maybe govern protection statements hickman pretrial hes called witness testify matters from pretrial discovery yes hickman  if witness took notes person said but lawyer chooses call witness well  well isnt criminal trial and  i think taken written notes testified content notes substance notes prosecutor able see purposes crossexamination and defense attorney if hes courts witness perhaps counsel entitled see notes no i mean purpose whether new rule applies we think decisions court cases like jencks gordon judges discretion were asking rule says judges must order stuff turned every single case what talking whether circumstances particular case circumstances pointed well man called purpose impeaching governments key witnesses perfectly legitimate obviously yet says ive got something would help impeach he cant impeached thats right you mean defense crossexamination government there request prosecutor time notes we thank make argument brief although necessary decision way comes rule 613 new federal rules end we would really entitled statements earlier in case van gamoran prosecutor made request witness showing statement prosecutor showing that done i would think yes thats right creates problems i agree rule 613 so maybe prosecutor would entitled retrial documents early still think that  well one thing respondent makes whole slew constitutional arguments would stand way common law jencks case type doctrine talking hes right and well also stand way new federal  thats right point  position principles jencks apply unless theres constitutional privilege stands way government different  right and concept applies terms federal rules evidence we completely right federal rules evidence mean and yes theres constitutional impediment working favor government so i think case important even evidentiary procedural questions somewhat murky transitional period deal constitutional claims know case retrial thered retrial future constitutional impediments government getting kind material kind situation thats right so one way one we would ask opinion court appeals reverse we think constitutional claims without merit many think without merit ill defer opponent point reserved rest time rebuttal just briefly on queens case purpose rule 613 get rid queens case dont show witness youre crossexamining rule 613 applies equally oral statements written statements whole argument think sound finally i think point came justice whites last question we call waiver brief theres constitutional involved whether sixth amendment one work product privilege sort discussed length replied brief fifth amendment one took discussed initial brief refreshing recollection makes difference kind discretion talking trial judge case makes difference if constitutional right whatever kinds privileges may exist prior calling witness subject opened defense counsel the principles brown versus united states raffle cases court may clear cannot open partway theres got crossexamination asking decision court provides trial judges kind discretion need all im saying situation like problem flagged early enough discussed legal argument judge let witness testify strike testimony counsel refuses turn if counsel officer court says made decision already hes going turn happens i dont think judge permit direct testimony it doesnt come often normal course things happened way case doesnt make difference terms argument,520.0,687,30,well hear arguments next 74634 united states nobles mr freidman may proceed youre ready why refer ordering defendant mr freidman couldnt order directed witness is southern district california  you must  one trying  give stuff ahead time could file mccrays office at least particular court thats  he never looks clerks office maybe time is sort reverse jencks case i misses what point lower court make ruling  anybody know time investigator going testify is crossexamination of prosecution witness  right all right before conferral defense colleagues defense counsel agreed hadnt now defense putting case with investigator   get investigators report but well seems go limited direct testimony whether investigator thats jencks act limitation was use reports the defense investigator going impeach government witnesses wont  werent shown new rules evidence go affect werent shown wouldnt get ill put way theres problem  youd problem rules would  whether solve another matter well one days youll were affect till july did district courts restriction bonds testimony permit testify lighting bank without showing report well getting little ahead story then ever i mean view he investigator the trial  trial court material turned  right right he i read story little bit investigator testified but two witnesses and from testifying  on subject more jencks he didnt get  jencks dont get fellow testified yes if anticipating problem wasnt but way matters testify order turn is ordinary jencks procedure yes i know i gather practices growing upturning according jencks statements  well advance  defense counsel trial begins but statute obligation turn anything run part government until witnesses completed direct testimony right well im wondering jencks act situation a judge couldnt say ill let testify anything promise government now tells going tend wouldnt i know doesnt happen im wondering whether judge would authority the prosecutor say im going  certainly jencks opinion would happened youd dismiss indictment at point would tell decide case 613 going become effective july 1 but survive 613 because otherwise i dont see decision case wouldnt settling major question law well issue 613 well see scope trial judges order requiring turnover necessarily tantamount allowing prosecution offer inhabit admitted evidence but i would think precisely trial court say “you must make available prosecutor document” and say “i order document admit evidences exhibit so” this statement allegedly made investigator suppose mr allis investigator the attorney and made note case different  protect discovery civil action hickman taylor wasnt but i mean justice blackmuns hypothesis lawyer id interview clearly protected pretrial case and verdict case man walks street tells lawyer i heard so say took notes calls witness rule and comes lawyer didnt know thing thats right use phrase seeking truth i say assuming well rule applied man walk street and lawyer walk courtroom volunteered witness no judge called witness whats youre try get case reverse put new rule never  alright are concentrating  apparently youre saying going put defense investigator entitled notes  interviews government witnesses did object defense crossexamination defense witnesses time prior statements without defense giving copy notes made statement yes wasnt rule  common rule evidence youre going crossexamine witness prior statement especially took written youre supposed show well government witnesses crossexamined ask well  if retrial rules effect apply lets assume apply would demand statements ive taken 613 time crossexamination but youre concentrating  concentrating getting documents defense investigator go stand youd face rule 612 well i know youd said mr freidman i really trouble saying anyone gains side case the jencks case constitutional decision  distinguishing government so far court appeals judgment went there retrial mr allis before youll get started let put one question dissenting opinion judge kilkenny ninth circuit he made statement assume appellants counsel playing games memorandum notes taken probably made reference impeachment questions propounded witness compliment otherwise would target reason refusal produce thats end quote can suggest hypothesis statement fact impliedly represented court would help defendant made available the pillars  still insisting quite right keep witness stand entirely rather letting testify demanding get statement court order produce thank gentlemen the case submitted,1354.0,1792,23,yes your honor id like i may  well i appreciate i could reserve little bit later i would like say time though your honor statement van gamoran statement hoffman written report investigator place seal court appeals the statement van gamoran defendants exhibit a court marked exhibit time testified i made known court appeals brief apparently descending judge look statements i know sir id ask district court end trial place seal court appeals last week i check theyre still safe los angeles it fits pertinent ill best see get thats correct yes los angeles its safe los angeles sir i trial counsel case trial i sent investigator john bond interview government witnesses it turned trial evidence respondent robert lee nobles testimony two eyewitnesses gamoran hoffman the court appeals recognized that eyewitness testimony far less impressive eyewitness testimony two defendants there lot evidence two defendants well deliberations jury entire testimony eyewitness hoffman read back jury also problems eyewitness testimony but defendant permitted put compelling evidence evidence john bond would testified one eyewitnesses old blacks look alike prior trial told hed also seen robber behind this  yes sir yes mr justice stewart that testimony john bond wouldve completely destroyed credibility two eyewitnesses the damage defendant exacerbated beyond repair comments prosecutor closing argument he said although well knew  john bond testify illegal disagreement privilege status reports nevertheless told jury reason behind testified witnesses never told things defense counsel merely trying inject racial element trial the preclusion sanction ordered trial court judging circumstances your honors much harsh there statute rule couldve forewarned defense counsel defendant would turnover reports this isnt case like example williams statute may include preclusion sanction possibility sanction this virtually unheard procedure trial court judge punished defendant good faith refusal obey order precluding testimony important witness defendant your honor i objected presented jury belief time undercut two fundamental interest favor defendant criminal justice system id like perhaps discuss minute reference case i  it defendant your honor case presents exact problem seems  the exact words wouldve helped client exact words reports reports safe show but trial court judge ordered petitioners view point i think reasonable interpretation relevant material turned now relevant material report order turned becomes problem relevant this test  statements eyewitnesses quality investigation without referring specific case along contended information confidential may i suggest couple hypothetical supposing one witness said “i saw robber back” also told investigator line “i wasnt sure i heard voice i sure” now arguably statement hearing voice relevant quality identification eyewitness its position facts made available government theres duty part defendant make known government he sir but  yes sir if judge decided that specifically relevant issue  sir i think least arguable id certainly believe judge could decide suggest relevant turned would violate underlying principle system justice accusatory system whereby government must bare entire burden the government duty relevant jencks act seems prove defendant guilty make sure evidence thats material defense the jencks act part duty courts decision brady versus maryland theres reciprocal duty part defendant help government prove guilty people guilty well sir mr justice powell willing bond crossexamined the protest report never going utilize us produced us trial produce we contended that basically internal defense document bond opened complete crossexamination moreover government couldve called back rebuttal two eyewitnesses testified direct it type secretary later subsequent interview were dealing statement written signed approved witnesses would situation mr justice white i believe report would  shown witness this  if  yes  statements  yes would  yes sir they could your honor based common law rules evidence the rule queenss case followed number courts i understand i would require statements signed witness approve witness written witness shown sensible witness actually seen statement agreed reflexes contemporaneous attempt  remarks report written somebody else produce trial written subsequent actual interview yes your honor we make three arguments regard privilege we think document like privileged adversary system interest effective assistance counsel its always held confidentiality preparation defense case essential ends we two privilege arguments come confidentiality heading the one sixth amendment one product our third privilege argument based fifth amendment aside privilege think simply matter court appeals exercise supervisory jurisdiction correct mistake trial court interpreting rules evidence governed disclosure documents trial yes yes mr justice rehnquist thats correct thats right but bond witness rule queens case would apply situation thats right no sir i respectfully disagree rule queens case specifically applicable direct examiner examining opposing parties witness i beg pardon the rule queens case would apply examiner governments witness i would turnover statements government witnesses   im crossexamining would apply make turnover government statements position witness completed testimony rule queens case would apply bond insofar statements bond possession government would turned crossexamination  to yes yes sir certainly yes mr chief justice there evidence record court appeals specifically found support contention recollection refreshed thats correct thats true weve  id like make copy actually perhaps your honor i dont think necessarily true cases if case important trial witness interviewed items parts report relevant specifically connected statements would testify defense counsel didnt they wanted make sure wouldnt turned government provide information it might investigator refresh recollection report in case i dont think thats issue case theres absolutely nothing record support finding refresh recollection the court appeals found  no your honor our contention   rules disclosure documents effect time trial compose common law rules evidence rule 16 federal rules criminal procedure jencks act the rule 16 c federal rules criminal procedure sets aside last sentence certain number items defense immune government discovery this document falls within last sentence two different phrases one report age end defendant secondly statement government witness made age end defendant now petitioner argues rule 16 applicable pretrial if one looks rule 16 b preceding subsection last sentence one finds that subsection carves certain number items belonging government cannot discovered defense but last phrase accepting far provided jencks act the jencks act comes effect trial therefore clear rule makers mind rule 16 applicable trial well free trial if shirt thrown table your honor would effect produce trial this situation report never produced trial am i directing question your honor crossexamination i report copy part i wanted question witness i could make sure i restating exact words told john bond never referred never brought jury report written never shown jury never introduced evidence now trial court judge discretion rule fill gaps solve problems considered rule makers interpret text manner achieves statutory justice court appeals wright case district columbia stated kind rule depending ones perspective would expand narrow specific rights privileges granted statute rule yes in sense entire report ordered produced order produce defense case our contention basic principles wright case indeed apply investigators report case order discovered now rule 16 compatible underlying principle accusatory system government must bare entire burden any suggestion government must least good chances defendant would prevail would seem violate basic principle favoring defendant order avoid conviction innocent the underlying principle system i referred earlier involved case would certainly influenced refusing obey courts order interest confidentiality i might add i may although view documents might damaged specific instance perhaps rebuttal necessary retrial hung jury reverse verdict if rule like made followed trial could mean terms defendant would i i would turnover laid trial concerning witnesses privilege confidentiality court recognized context hickman versus taylor essential system justice historically lawyers worked officers court protect interest clients now way thats done court said hickman certain degree privacy this  this petitioners viewpoint true hickman deal statement made attorney oppose investigator your honor weve cited brief number cases say hickman apply i think although would say doesnt apply many would say apply thats correct absolutely correct your honor im moving three privilege arguments we basically rest contention merely exercise court appeals supervisory discretion challenge completely new rule fashioned district court judge defendant criminal case the court appeals third circuit unanimous embank decision hickman later affirm court recognized that policy confidentiality open jives cenacle but believe sound know irrefutably established law although capable laboratory demonstration only principle confidentiality assure defense counsel get facts favorable unfavorable hes going need direct whats going happen case whether dispose trial whether go trial take stand witnesses testify your honors id like suggest  it would refresh recollection notes conceivably would different way indicated although i would argue jury waiving report somehow relying fact  the confidentiality your honors protects internal documents defense made defense team this report  one member defense team investigator attorney   one  mr justice marshall youre correct suggesting that would different sense certainly communication one member defense team thats correct mr justice marshall i think certainly would much arguable something like could produce two reasons one scientific kind statement number two criminal case i think extra reasons criminal case protect documents and thirdly  yes your honor wed contend in addition attorney criminal defendant really close agent really extension defendant there much closer  yes sir i would certainly prefer that normal practice investigator get written statement signed witness approved much effective examining witness but i think problems defendant interviewing government witness illustrated case here important government witness refused meet investigator finally agreed talk telephone report made subsequent conversation telephone theres great  hoffman your honor bank teller bank robbery experience tends prejudice defendant assuming governments right bringing man trial i beg pardon prejudice robber thats correct what im saying government witnesses often assume government right man therefore immediately prejudice man thats one problems really seeing adversary system works in words adversary system presupposes erratically two equally strong sides thats true this court wardius versus oregon recognizes government special advantages investigating case beyond theres problem effect systems counsel defendants the relationship trust confidence client defendant aba recognized cornerstone criminal justice system something particularly hard achieve criminal oppose civil cases its going affected contend defendant sees counsel giving government material conceivably favorable government the literature plead course instances defendants trusting public defenders thinking defendants  counsels another arm government so problem trust confidence even greater excuse the problem confidentiality course outline hickman problem investigators investigating thoroughly  perhaps writing reports in understanding mr justice white question assuming situation report shown jury although actually verdict referred  and hes looking report certainly report turned government hes refreshing recollection the  answer your honor refreshing recollection doctrine traditionally matter common law trial practice therefore exception privilege argument i think question waiver perhaps absolutely theres specific  your honor contention common law rules evidence rule refreshing recollection one complimentary rule 16 theres rule common law evidence specifically making exception rule 16 followed specific rule there rule evidence would either authorize  would authorize government produce circumstances  would authorize government get hold circumstances thank you,533.0,700,51,and deal anytime wanted order argument if want take right dont want  fine do know judges seal district court the statements mean investigator reports oral statements is fact did panel set panel im sure set san francisco los angeles  facts  versions suggested crossexamination course arent  two prosecution witnesses form didnt tell investigator may i ask question im sure i dont understand postural case statements possession witness corroborated testimony object presented jury well representing defendants generally representing defendant where primary obligation well suggested earlier question justice powells question representation made inference contained report wouldnt help client did judge think would exercise matter relevant precise issue could intact subject excising open new problem how could decide hypothetical  could decide relevant even defense opens subject crossexamination was report bonds handwriting typed typewriter would position today different would possession statements signed prosecution witnesses referred crossexamination it would different you would agree statements could demanded trial court and tell draw  distinction statements signed witness recordation witness statement investigator this product the lawyers product the rule queens case rule governing crossexamination isnt and followed places others you talking witnesses terms two prosecution witnesses focusing upon bond witness this statement certainly prepared therefore adapted authorize eventhough might typed stenographer hasnt but werent required produce prosecution going examine right and court  clear case queens case rule i think bond witness well  youre confused terms what mean direct examiner examining opposing parties witness there thing theres direct examination theres  when youre going crossexamine  well rather mr allis  thats right when government undertook mr bond testified government would entitled crossexamine youll agree could government ask whether refreshed recollection interview reference notes made well isnt quite old established rule notes used refresh recollection witness maybe examined opposing counsel then whats problem no cant know this man regular investigator public defenders office hes inquiring interviewing dozens people many many cases i would assume just might counter part investigator law enforcement agency isnt reasonable wouldnt reasonable quite assume careful lawyer would require investigator refresh recollection reports appearing courtroom he wouldnt ask crossexamination whether  what crossexamination would ask governments witness whether aware bloody shirt found connection thing answer “no” and investigator sitting counsel table waiting called witness simply pulls bloody shirt pocket puts front upon table full view jury is position district court would find justification one rules evidence order order shirt least brought court inspection see light would shed trial yes certainly is evidence either clause evidence suggested report either looking otherwise of course judge pratts order wright case good deal broader district courts order wasnt hickman wouldnt protect statement made investigating agent would oppose statement made lawyer mr justice blackmuns hypothetical theres lot district court law says statements investigators protected hickman i think youre right rule 16 argument irrelevant mr allis would witness notes pocket hes testify would little different  get confidentiality award pocket no in case well got notes pocket i dont know  but wouldnt necessarily working product could made like take position hands obviously working product is  what im representing condemnee i employ appraiser makes report value property can i say hes one condemnees team therefore report discoverable you wrong hickman still prevail criminal case i well dont think attorney condemnee pretty much close agent mr allis normally im talking personally defense counsel normally send investigator do prefer obtain statements witnesses customarily done civil practice statements signed witnesses use effectively crossexamine witnesses instruct investigators never take statement cost statement might used but investigator write report submission today never use what normal practice one two witnesses hoffman but many cases idea whether witness going progovernment prodefense neutral prejudice robber  whether defendant one robbers whole issue i suppose bond stand asking questions would impeach government witnesses saying tell so and bond piece paper hand looking now would show  would say could show would show government counsel well thats referred jury your man stand youre asking questions think impeach government witness hes looking piece paper well difference make terms privileges so think  at least think rule 16 doesnt forbid its piece paper say rule 16 would protect producing werent looking trial you anything mr

Wall, II, Director of Rhode Island Department of Corrections",Khalil Kholi,9.0,0.0,0,947.0,1639,40,thank mr chief justice may please court the issue court today whether state court sentence reduction motion pure plea leniency qualifies quote application postconviction collateral review  within meaning 28 usc section 2244d2 the state respectfully argue least three reasons term collateral review refers legal challenge refer recognized postdirect appeal applications constitutional jurisdictional fundamental errors may raised first court said presumed  congress presumed known language court used decisions term 2255 applications type independent civil inquiries testing validity conviction andor sentence well i think parties agreement your honor postconviction review parcel collateral review thats yes  respect your honor collateral review  i think parties agreement  embraces state postconviction review must also quoteunquote collateral review also i think importantly would anomalous tolling provision talking direct appeal already concluded embrace things dont  dont  come prior direct appeal this tolling  obviously 2244d1 speaks finality state court judgment conviction at point obviously well made  made prior conviction becomes final for example made within 120 days imposition sentence or made within 120 days affirmance conviction direct appeal rhode island supreme court so made prior conviction becomes quoteunquote final that true your honor well im sure conceded point your honor i think clearly agreement postconviction vehicles habeas vehicles obviously traditionally occur direct appeal concluded obviously qualify courts  everybody would suggest  recognize quoteunquote collateral review in terms rule 35 motion says example sentence outside  outside proper boundaries unlawful matter law i dont think weve actually conceded court that would qualify but certainly not correct our rule 35 contains within provision challenge legality sentence manner imposed a pure legal challenge correct we would suggest court doesnt answer question there good arguments would tolling provision speaks collateral review  2255 well certainly youre first circuit recognized making pure plea leniency sentence leniency youre well could argued well could argued talking vehicles challenge validity judgment already survived scrutiny direct review and rule 35 vehicle even one raises legal challenge tolling provision simply would begin run point well would suggest your honor collateral review explained court referring difference collateral review direct review and case this  clearly  direct review process no this court though your honor said speaking congress enacted 2255 simplified procedure making collateral attack final judgment entered federal criminal case purport modify distinction collateral review direct review well go forward use  even  would suggest your honor even strongly phrase collateral review phrase used court consistently recognizes procedure occurs completion direct review process but your honor respectfully state v addonizio contrasted rule 35 motion example many jurisdictions including obviously federal courts  almost exact rule 35type proceeding its never referred never understood thousands cases collateral review its always understood sort quasicivil inquiry we dont believe your honor we dont believe ever referred sentence plea sentence leniency your honor plea pure plea leniency rule 35 yes thats correct  correct your honor we speaking pre1987 guidelines rule i think your honor differentiate legal ground vehicle again vehicle reduction plea leniency vehicle legal vehicle its simply i think kholi kind recognized but well extent abuse discretion really shorthand appellate court takes look sentence within proper bounds quote justification imposition sentence affirmed and like if justification  i say hasnt happened far state i think  i dont know happens states but essentially thats inquiry if within legal bounds filing motion pre87 guidelines presumes validity conviction sentence simply says give second chance take second look look offender look characteristics look they could they could there wide correct its much different your honor its essentially it simply because dont believe legal matters your honor what asking sentence leniency based sure factual matters like indicated your honor chief justice history individual various no your honor we procedure whereby generally sentence reduction sentencing issues must raised pursuant rule 35 if i could no correct correct what yes well suggest abuse discretion that talking justification again look sentence justification it abuse discretion if justification  hasnt happened if  sentence within legal limits justification it affirmed thats shorthand we no what saying your honor justification within legal sentencing bounds denial rule 35 motion affirmed and happens time because inquiry simply  i understand words abuse discretion used justification manifestly excessive standard  simply cases explicate looks sentence legal justification appeal denied i understand but certainly your honor using formulation everything filed state court post judgment conviction qualifies would certainly odd way congress expect yes yes certainly your honor the court may correct legal sentence time  period the court may correct sentence imposed illegal manner may reduce sentence motion filed within 120 days sentence imposed within 120 days receipt court mandate  were talking  case involves motion reduce sentence and certainly policy considerations congress would intended it might it might your honor and system might  might characterized sentence reduction provision sentence reduction vehicle legal motion correct illegal sentence challenging sentence sure if i could address your honor the problem simply statute limitations affirmative defense matter already going included state court before anyone files 2254 state courts going findings this either going motion sentence leniency going motion correct illegal sentence these matters going to pled state well so applicant goes federal court district court files 2254 want raise affirmative defense time bar save federal court lot time obviously case  contrast exhaustion example court obviously familiar presents complicated questions whether know state procedures exhausted claims exhausted straightforward if somebody raises motion challenges legality sentence characterized state court run mine  run mine cases illegal sentence right well well suggest actually straightforward your honor if somebody captions document motion sentence  sentence reduction motion correct illegal sentence  thats case obviously well may much magic words  court said substance motion seeks already determined state court because because your honor actually want reduce sentence its  dont suggest  matter playing games they feel sentenced 30 years maybe want 20 years want challenge legality sentence recognize established collateral attack vehicles well spoken words collateral review embracing case thats already  upon looking proceeding occurs finality judgment obviously includes courts denial cert time no it it certainly your honor and would suggest no we would suggest your honor that furthers argument a rule 35 motion collateral review motion  could say even legal sense motion its motion occurs judgment becomes final and looking tolling provision congressional intent tolling provision finality exhaustion state remedies they 120 days it filed sentence imposed 120 days date 120 days conviction becomes final we would suggest term collateral review embraces justice alito indicated sort concept obviously tolling provision begins run conviction becomes final its clearly your honor correct i think everybody recognizes kholi panel respondents case well characterized rule 35 proceeding sort apart distinct away underlying case and thats undoubtedly true sense  part direct review process its  clearly but doesnt mean collateral review its eitheror it it  neither fish fowl your honor i mean simply part direct review process doesnt mean quote collateral review collateral review sort meaning law using courts decisions using courts cases referring postjudgment vehicle fundamental jurisdictional types errors raised well i dont know needs called anything your honor i think question respect well certainly  certainly interesting vehicle filed prior finality judgment filed  filed judgment becomes final and going  going back policies 2244d2 clearly two big policies finality obviously promotes  cases would federal court timebarred  exhaustion state remedies to motion seeks leniency purpose could accomplished bringing motion federal court therefore doesnt serve purpose we but  important element your honor vehicles raised bring  vehicles collateral vehicles states channelled constitutional jurisdictional fundamental claims the rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle doesnt  cant cant service so sure could  could habeas issue claim raised habeas could know violation  state rights couldnt heard 2254 exactly but congress may well said going business looking individual claims look collateral review vehicle this vehicle recognized vehicle bringing channelling claims so thats going toll but vehicle rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle never used claim could go federal court its pointless i mean wouldnt serve purpose course would undermine states interest getting state prisoners federal court within 1 year i rest time thats okay your honor thank mr chief justice thank mr chief justice again i could clarify regarding scope rule 35 the reporters notes rule 35 make clear illegal sentence one imposed valid conviction authorized law it includes eg sentence excess provided statute imposition unauthorized form punishment judgment conform oral sentence supreme court gone explain provision saying never  never challenged constitutionality penal statute context rule 35 motion declare sentence imposed pursuant unconstitutional statute illegally contemplated rule 35 im sorry justice sotomayor although dicta language supreme court says essentially file challenges sentence pursuant rule 35 clear certain types challenges brought rule 35 motion in run mill cases brought appellate record direct appeal commonly brought pursuant states postconviction relief right the ones correct rule 35a sentence authorized law imposed unauthorized form punishment judgment correct correct correct well  correct that correct correct right and and position would thats part direct review appellate process thats but your honor could occur time that occur 5 10 years 20 years later and but would suggest yes point would your honor doesnt move start 1year limitations period the start 1year limitations period court said jiminez v quarterman begins begins it begins judgment becomes final 90 days supreme court affirms judgment conviction it doesnt no what  respectfully i going say collateral review refers court said duncan v walker habeas postconviction relief vehicles  occur conviction become final it becomes final well jiminez v walker becomes final  90 days supreme court affirms conviction because congress decided pick day appeal becomes  conviction becomes final always occurs 90 days states high court yes congress set four dates conviction becomes final,886.0,1258,57,we hear argument first morning case 09868 wall v kholi mr weisman but mr weisman phrase postconviction  collateral review and certainly rule 25  35 motion postconviction so postconviction its direct review why isnt responsive or usually means something addition can go back   said prior i thought rule 35 motion made conviction but isnt true regardless whether rule 35 motion seeks legal relief discretionary relief alone made prior finality judgment and  i understand argument argument rule 35 motions seek legal review fall within 2244d2 language its rule 35 motions seek discretionary relief would rule 35 permit challenge federal violation you given example illegal sentence think discretionary i correct but rule 35a permit legal challenge kind justice kagan asking all right lets assume pure legal challenge would rule 35a collateral relief designated statute so explain dont think collateral no no why rule 35 assuming challenge illegal sentence legal ground why would collateral review i dont  i dont understand argument it seems phrase postconviction collateral review means postconviction collateral review preconviction collateral review isnt added postconviction whats postconviction i guess would preconviction wouldnt thats fine and direct review so collateral review so  lose i would think  anything point making hinges postconviction collateral phrase rather word review i suppose could argued reviewing judgment asking mercy whether judgment good bad asking mercy and i would  know perhaps review is point well thats cases weve involved weve never case like so cases weve used natural term collateral review that doesnt mean couldnt apply it means weve never occasion inquire whether applies mr weisman i think thats right  say rule 35 motion rhode island based federal rule 35 motion existed prior 1987 couple occasions court talked prior federal rule 35 collateral review am i wrong us v robinson barton v united states i might wrong and current federal rule provides its rule 35 also doesnt pure leniency thats rhode island lets assume adopt formulation generally legal error collateral review legal error even add ninth circuit found court order avoid clemency parole review boards forth i dont see dont lose anyway allegation complaint argument may abuse discretion abuse discretion legal ground set aside sentence its motion made court reviewable appellate courts state its little odd say legal if  abuse discretion standard something quite familiar law weve never thought somehow extralegal and justification are different characteristics sentencing judge looks first instance in words  youve obviously seen lot i havent seen i mean rule 35 motions typically say  typically concede legal validity sentence simply say  i mean i assume sentencing completely open put anything like deprived childhood unique situation age whatever in sense rule 35 different arguments made sentencing but thats bad isnt point justice kennedy raising if sort arguments get raise legal matter prior imposition sentencing considered legal matters raised rule 35 are issues  typically raised direct  direct review do quarrel statement mallacone rhode island 2000 decision says we interfere trial courts discretion vis vis sentencing rare instances trial justice imposed sentence without justification grossly disparate sentences generally imposed similar offenses  is review standard that standard review so please explain justice kennedy described review abuse discretion review abuse discretion legal challenge im sorry am i misunderstanding are saying rhode island appellate courts never change sentence rule 35 or saying find lack justification well  think saying gets reversed abuse discretion right and thats legal ground seems and i dont know could say thats plea leniency its plea sentencing court abused discretion given lesser sentence how leniency its abuse discretion i dont want to figure case case even jurisdiction jurisdiction whether abuse discretion review leniency review and  makes inclined say treat rule 35 coming within tolling provision dont grapple  i mean im much success understanding distinction youre telling im dont want to 50 states can read relevant provision rule 35 there two categories ones legal challenges least i read rule read relevant part rule 35 and talking reducing mr weisman im sorry before talk policy motion reduce sentence short it says man prays sentence imposed respect matter reduced accordance provisions rule 35  would make difference said prays sentence imposed  prays illegal sentence imposed respect matter reduced accordance provisions rule 35  if put word illegal would made difference so suggest difficulty justice scalia raises going to look particular rule state going to look particular motion going look  going to look state law regarding motions construed and going difficult determination so petitioner future rhode island file petition says im filing motion pursuant 35a illegal sentence make something or leniency and district courts supposed figure whether legal challenge frivolous basis law fact decide whether would toll toll based side trial whats illegal sentence whats plea leniency thats proposing so say correct illegal sentence abuse discretion  so magic words illegal sentence magic words abuse  magic words either  either victory give absolutely nothing truly stupid defendant lawyers rhode island i mean would anybody caption 35 motion way whats lose you say doesnt matter claim illegal sentence frivolous what lose there another argument could make one pressing collateral review means something step criminal case but chosen make correct but youve said could done finality i thought im sure said earlier motion made judgment final didnt say but thats said you said finality which im sorry im sure i understand there nothing rule bars litigant filing conviction final they 120 days justice scalias suggestion except says perhaps  leniency review  review conviction sentence but didnt  didnt anything you didnt argue kind review thats involved leniency really review sentence legal error so  something its direct collateral i guess need new adjective ive always thought two kinds review direct collateral you say  tertium quid what want us call i think maybe doesnt need called anything doesnt exist i  i cant imagine anything isnt either direct collateral but mr weisman thats true also state habeas claims based state law but six circuits said 2244d2 applies claims are contesting where exhaustion policy come effect thank counsel ms mizner im sorry i  speaking fast i didnt follow perhaps go back simple question defendant sentenced bring challenge sentence direct appeal or go rule 35a okay so get point go 35a cant so go direct appeal correct thats called illegal so illegal and odd thing  kind appeal takes place either days possibly weeks defendant may already appealed conviction higher court is right that normally happens and im curious happens court affirms sentence lets say two months already affirmed conviction which judgment pursuant  judgment became final conclusion direct review why the person held custody pursuant judgment state court least relevant judgment sentence appealed then conclusion direct review respect judgment respect held custody im reading statute federal statute exactly thats i dont  thats i confused i look language federal statute seems individual held custody pursuant judgment sentence final and sentence final lower court say sentence final conclusion direct review respect sentence hasnt even taken place yet okay then going say appeals rhode island sentences  appeals lawfulness mercy take place rule 35 collateral im totally confused if part criminal proceeding position collateral part proceedings proceeding become final that  truly   youre but rhode island court told litigants cant challenge portions illegal sentence except way rule 35 call decision affirmance conviction final determination legality sentence thats contradictory thats says it talks judgment and judgment terms usually conviction sentence rhode island reasons separated two thank counsel the case submitted,872.0,946,21,mr chief justice may please court the first circuit correctly held khalil kholis motion reduction sentence rhode island rule 35 application state postconviction collateral review respect pertinent judgment claim as tolled aedpas 1year limitation period mr kholis petition timely filed we look common usage ordinary understanding words tolling provision context statute collateral review proceeding occurring final judgment could affect judgment yes purposes tolling provision in duncan court talked possibility civil commitment contempt custody could part rule 2254 proceeding that would postconviction so postconviction form collateral review form in duncan court also discussed fact many states may call states call postconviction review something else that would also collateral the collateral  umbrella encompasses postconviction forms review judgment under states theory would i file motion i may respects your honor one from states perspective i dont think problem omitting word illegal yes it request court  review take second look reexamine sentence determine whether unduly severe time imposed you asking court  take second look either based factors either submitted sentencing additional information you raise issues postconviction review you also raise  rhode island provision postconviction review statute speaks  facts would require new proceeding interests justice in rhode island challenge sentence direct review you challenge way rule 35 motion its normal thats normal vehicle used challenging sentence i believe could also encompass motion postconviction relief kind umbrella rhode island procedure raising under understanding rhode island supreme court decisions answer i believe that holding rhode island supreme court exhaustion federal habeas limited exhaustion claims going presented federal habeas petition and since denial request sentence reduction grounds abuse discretion going claim cognizable federal habeas corpus jurisdiction would need exhaust exhaustion one purposes tolling provision court recognized aedpas purpose principles comity finality federalism clear purpose encouraging litigants pursue claims state court prior seeking federal review so tying tolling provision state applications shows congressional concern comity core respect state processes used reviewing claims state prisoners it would raised state rule 35 motion correct it could raised state postconviction review proceedings well no no not direct appeal rule 35 collateral proceeding yes perhaps motion postconviction relief section 1091 a prisoner receives adequate relief state court whatever vehicle may choose pursue federal habeas corpus claim i would say would unlikely many federal habeas cases  raise questions example ineffective assistance counsel sentencing a state resolution reduces sentence would obviate need federal habeas petition context 2255 justice ginsburg tolling provision reason may perhaps respect comity congress recognized addressing 2254 petition filed state prisoner i dont practice rhode island case rule 35 sit it resolved trial court within 3 months the issue potential abuse sitting motions limited rhode island rule 35 its peculiar concern well rule 35 also provides decision must made within reasonable time no 120 days time frame within motion must filed the rule also provides must decided resolved within reasonable time so  limitation respect i found rhode island cases discussing particular question yes thats understanding also no a rule 35 motion must filed within 120 days a defendant would interest getting he could correct filing motion time in trial court he appeals yes if appeals pending time practice would consolidate would ruling rhode island supreme court then judgment would become final rhode island supreme court affirms conviction either court you may two time frames i would say june there may appeal  denial rule 35 it  rule 35 rhode islands manner addressing rule 35 seems somewhat unusual terms if rule 35 motion filed rhode island supreme court affirms judgment judgment conviction it justice breyer and i seen rhode island cases addressing rule 35 motion filed judgment conviction affirmed context looking discretionary in terms motion reduction leniency i seen  prejudgment  prerhode island supreme court resolution that rhode island supreme court said i well court discussed  used term collateral review number different contexts civil cases habeas cases manner distinguishing direct review something outside direct review collateral generally means supplementary defined blacks collateral attack blacks defined attack judgment proceeding direct appeal but rule 35 motion rhode island part direct appeal it separate specific it part case justice alito  motion new trial based newly discovered evidence viewed collateral also part original proceeding the motions new trial  motion new trial filed within 10 14 days conviction would part direct appeal therefore would  would collateral but motion new trial filed judgment affirmed court appeals time cert passed would collateral there indication congress limiting use term collateral review postconviction legal challenge congress could said wished traditionally motions filed  motions new trial  may filed judgment affirmed viewed courts collateral collateral review so  tradition doesnt limit use term collateral review proceeding completely separate apart indeed 2255 may separately filed consolidated original proceeding theres entry docket shall file pleadings separate case it goes back original case 2255 collateral heard trial court so  reason assume congress limiting collateral review something outside original proceeding yes no i justice kagan because 2244d2 tolling application review respect pertinent judgment claim and  application clemency doesnt produce change judgment rendered court its request related legal reasoning behind judgment doesnt challenge basis judgment executive branch function cases advice consent legislative body judicial review so i would agree yes justice ginsberg rule 33 motion new trial based newly discovered evidence courts held collateral its question  motions filed makes collateral they part direct review process tolling would come  play judgment become final this addressed  would impact tolling yes yes well judgment would become final far state concerned appeal appeal rhode island supreme court yes yes yes it filed within 121 days entry it would filed sentence imposed and sentence i would say becomes final imposed,936.0,1317,76,am i correct think postconviction collateral review means anything occurs conclusion direct review then phrase collateral review add why  wouldnt congress say postconviction review why dont call motion motion correct illegal sentence then wouldnt dispute i gather you one stupid lawyers worried laughter im sure but think  whoever files motions simply said would problem right well want something legal review right you want throw mercy court you got plenty avenues correct illegality sentence something different right this  correct  admit illegal say still reduced lot reasons you raise  claims normal state collateral postconviction state habeas thing right so i guess im trouble you  various grounds sentence lower including fact setting sentence level abuse discretion obviously raise sentencing raise direct review right can challenge  state habeas thats vehicle  thats vehicle challenging sentence so conviction state theres appeal number  direct review number issues improperly admitted evidence forth  lawyer cant add  addition sentenced wrong provision he given 5 years many judge cited wrong provision you cant say direct review you challenge conviction sentence direct review do agree rule 35 something prisoner must exhaust seeking federal habeas isnt whole purpose allowing tolling 1year federal statute purpose give petitioner opportunity exhaust must exhaust i may asked already seems unusual i want make sure answer you client convicted particular offense results sentence zero 5 years okay and judge imposing sentence engages racial discrimination it turns sentences african americans 5 years caucasian defendants 2 years that telling claim cannot raise direct review  state habeas well say would raised are saying raised rule 35 thats i would thought so rule 35 vehicle challenging sentence okay i  adversary said contrary i  flipflopping can brought direct appeal an illegal sentence so mean answered chief justice could brought collateral proceedings thats  adversary gets rebuttal confirm point challenge illegal sentence brought first rule 35a motion regardless grounds illegality can i return question justice ginsburg asked couple minutes ago lets say case defendant convicted state court exhausted federal claims defendant wants raise federal habeas also files motion seeking reduction sentence based purely request leniency sentence within range prescribed statute what purpose served tolling time file federal habeas pendency request leniency state court you say comity concrete practical terms purpose served in experience happen lot you somebody sentenced 5year sentence thats within range also legal challenges would result conviction time whatsoever criminal conviction person decides give legal challenge 5year sentence might reduced 3 2 1 can explain if look 2255  thats federal postconviction review also 1year statute limitations that limitation would tolled federal rule 35 motion tolled state i think ms mizner amicus brief case asserted rhode island states rule like many judges sit rule 35 motions they let stay pending considerable period time order retain ability modify sentence feel like is understanding happens motions sit denied well i guess question  im sorry i cut  question abuse may good thing the idea got motion reduction sentence mercy judge might say well im inclined exercise mercy come rehab program good way turns first several months model prisoner in words question abuse good thing start saying time federal habeas tolled judges might inclined exercise charity based prisoners conduct conviction 120 days right for filing right do indication case law reasonable time consists can go back second imagine defendant convicted robbery hes sentenced ten years he thinks error conviction legal nature thinks another error sentence legal nature now i take rhode island files appeal consider first and second files rule 35 motion and file rule 35 motion says time no doesnt say it says court may correct illegal sentence time it nothing mercy i want know works he says legal error sentence when  get corrected dont take i view i want fact im asking fact how person correct legal error sentence where if trial court says fine okay so two appeals one judgment conviction another judgment imposing sentence now federal statute says oneyear period limitation shall apply date judgment became final correct okay when date judgment sentence became final and   time why sentence in april affirm conviction in june affirm sentence do two months  date judgment became final conclusion direct review run april june june okay now suppose doesnt suppose appeals  i see our problem appeal judgment  sentence asks correction matter mercy law there may what im trying figure willing call purposes one  oneyear statute begins run time direct appeal becomes final why direct appeal sentence appeal matter law isnt direct appeal sentence ask mercy its rule its procedure this would help much i imagine im trying get straight mind you see basic question why  look two appeals one judgment one sentence okay january june you prepared say oneyear statute begin run june fine the rule 35 motion took appeal became final purposes federal habeas statute june so doesnt rule 35 motion become final 1a habeas statute whenever decided finally why collateral why isnt direct first one direct wait minute judgment judgment conviction judgment sentence thats reason doesnt become final appealed sentence yet havent  didnt consolidate i quite confused see works rhode island rhode island  i used first circuit i know special ways things they sometimes different different there must rhode island complaints sentence both what would happen statutory maximum offense rhode island 5 years sentencing judge imposes sentence 10 years defense attorney time says well cant thats statutory maximum judge goes ahead appeal taken are saying appellate court rhode island would entertain argument they would say go back make rule 35 motion trial court i mean thats procedure that seems odd is is citation that could i return something basic do think term collateral review legal term art term  interpret simply looking word collateral dictionary isnt  i look collateral attack blacks law dictionary wont i find definition wont tell something proceeding this attack judgment outside proceeding led entry judgment isnt term generally means right it part case what regular motion new trial based newly  newly discovered evidence is collateral part criminal proceeding whats wrong argument nothing occurs criminal case collateral what congress mind spoke collateral review something like habeas let give alternative interpretation maybe completely wrong tell wrong postconviction term art many states including rhode island postconviction review statutes so congress wanted time time proceedings tolled  pending tolled  every state uses phrase not every state uses term they names proceeding thats whats meant collateral review collateral review term art its something understand looking word collateral dictionary whats wrong im saying whether legal something else it whether criminal case criminal case do 2255  original case habeas substitute it adopted congress substitute habeas isnt right do think petition clemency presented governor would toll limitations period why  different well may right i dont think thats reason i  i thought held word filed petition means filed court filed governor its  word filed  tolling provision  work you think doesnt matter  i mean rule 35 motion motion made original criminal proceeding side so isnt collateral attack  another proceeding decide subject main proceeding rule 35 motion filed criminal proceeding so  motion filed judgment happen judgment final would tolling so answer yes this motion filed either judgment time tolled made judgment made there seems confusion judgment rendered motion made there conviction sentence right so judgment rendered thats different whether judgment final federal sense its final far state concerned judgment rendered correct but appeal final day rendered as far state concerned if appeal may undo correct so judgment always postjudgment well thats  thats state says anyway the state says i think way 35 reads doesnt filed judgment thats right it cant filed later but doesnt say cant filed judgment thats right when  become final when  even trial court level become final thank counsel mr weisman six minutes

fifth circuit williams versus wood held without regard scienter factor always taken never taken consideration question immunity judges dating back bradley versus fisher it irrelevant policy potential harm deny absolute judicial immunity section 1983 damages greatly outweighed good public is derivative judge our position absolute judicial immunity enjoyed court clerk derives status court test immunity dependent status court well suppose judge said rule youve got thats set page 9 dont ever follow continues follow is still immune if clerk refused follow court order would still submit would absolutely immune case it question status function as long duties performed order does go property clerk does rule apply deputy clerk yes your honor and assistant clerk as long official yes and stenographer tell stop your honor and man opens door man sweeps room you havent told stop yet the line drawn case based test applied judicial immunity cases stop clerk person longer acting official aide judge order judicial duties may properly accomplished this applies say judges bailiff absolute judicial immunity applied bailiffs courts acts his chauffeur no your honor why because chauffeur extension court clerk arm court the chauffeur well bailiff the bailiff how bailiff acting chauffeur the bailiff acting chauffeur yes absolutely immune 1983 damages liability why under theory because acting aide court his status taken context court he called bailiff anything else look conduct conduct chauffeur nothing court system i assume would enjoy immunity status chauffeur earlier i thought responded one question indicated clerk order judge failed carry order would still immunity now derivative judge quasiimmunity act hes judge ordered failing judge ordered our position sense clerk

common law clerk fact enjoy immunity damage liability why wouldnt qualified immunity adequate terms exactly happened if say was piece negligence would need qualified immunity the clerk enjoy absolute absolute judicial immunity qualified immunity would forced trial defend good faith acts conduct intimately related judicial process the independence judiciary would require clerk go court sit defense table defend conduct may end turn fact result negligence even intentional conduct the point court system clogged judicial machinery break court clerks required defend actions court 1983 actions why clerks ever post bonds court courts post bond fiduciary capacity trustee well arent absolutely immune are paying money nothing bonds no theyre but question bonds different question whether court 1983 action subject absolute can sue clerk bond can clerk sued bond conduct malfeasance office a clerk could sued bond could also alternative remedies clerk sued besides bond why sued bond hes absolutely immune because statute well state statute provide chapter 25 section 10 alternative remedy clerk court principal clerk liable acts subordinates well illinois illinois bond required clerk bond insurance policy like public liability driving automobile bond simply replace money receives embezzles yes latter aspect purpose bond state illinois purpose replace moneys taken illegally clerk suppose illinois legislature passed statute says know weve read immunity state officers 1983 assumption supreme court courts kind immunity essential get public work done well hereby declare essential get illinois public work done immunity 1983 there certainly wouldnt immunity would the clerk would immune acting official aide court order discharge courts duties but state doesnt want protection officers protect public business the state legislate area done already illinois revised statutes clerks act would think could clerk sued state law the clerk could sued state law and would immune under state law would immune under state law today statute would provide principal clerk sued acts deputies he could sued conduct right would immune state law under state law question decided whether clerk enjoys judicial immunity but state statute case authority permits clerk sued civil action for negligence deputies yes negligence deputies arent asking federal courts roman romans if illinois courts illinois legislature permit sort action state court clerk i would think justice white quite right illinois determined absolute immunity isnt necessary or kind immunity well statute i referred available alternative remedy tested i tell research the statute books question raised drury versus mclean county held clerk court illinois historically member judiciary branch so say open question it open question illinois the drury case you told could recovery clerk illinois court state law conduct your honor im sorry the case thats told ago well case issue open issue my point state statute could provide remedy clerk well thats mean remedy conduct state law it clear fact statute exists is state statute cited anywhere yes your honor in brief it cited respondents brief reply brief its footnote 3 respondents brief thank may i ask question is difference action nonaction clerk assume example clerk neglected issue mandate court inadvertently failed that would nonaction you nonaction case does immunity argue extend regardless whether action nonaction yes your honor reason acting official aide judge capacity clerk relevant whether intended whether intended result accomplished the fact policy considerations require order judicial machinery able function essential court officers clerks courts clogged petitioners like clerk circuit court go defend actions performance nonperformance disrupt court system degree potential harm deny absolute judicial immunity must outweighed public good clerks clerking sitting courtrooms defending actions complaints 1983 either inaction action what inaction deliberate the clerk didnt want mandate issue didnt agree our position would absolute judicial immunity would exist regardless intent malice bad faith even deliberately ignored judgment court it better yes it better allow one corrupt corrupt clerk go free faithful clerks whose ardor definitely dampened performing faithful duties policy instituted subject liability allegations malice bad faith complaint the facts case simple the clerk alleged done anything wrong all create procedures these procedures intimately mr mayer didnt raise question whether clerk could held substantively liable 1983 as i understand petition question raise assuming clerk held liable rather detached passive acts whether notwithstanding substantive liability may assert absolute immunity yes your honor petition question presented limited whether enjoy absolute judicial immunity acts taken discharge duties official aid court order courts judicial functions properly accomplished and facts case clearly reflect clerk petitioner created procedures courts knowledge courts approval courts supervision clearly act clerk within scope authority clerk court in case petitioner clearly clearly held absolutely immune act intimately related integrally related judicial process the 1983 cases circuits dealt issue held majority cases held clerks immune held clerk courts common law immunity abrogated enactment section 1983 well abrogated state law well clerks immunity still survive regardless whether 1983 actions question whether why would the question whether clerk absolutely immune 1983 dependent upon whether common law clerk enjoyed immunity damages sued performing acts clerk discharge duties regardless common law establishes clerk court amenable suit acting direction supervision court a presumption existed clerk acted acted authority court acted regardless whether negligent intentional now cases dealt circuits consistently held whether failure notify someone pursuant court order whether failure send notice copy notice appeal regardless whether clerk refused docket particular piece paper end result the analysis focused whether clerk acted official aid judge order judicial duties could properly accomplished and policy considerations behind clear clerks required defend actions federal court plaintiffs able indirectly cannot directly the clerk one go defend court orders court actions cannot done judge sued section 1983 by bringing clerk court court system bogged in system like cook county circuit court cook county clerk court go defend every time disgruntled person feels like filing section 1983 suit based upon conduct well certainly respondent disgruntled person that correct you havent made mention facts underlying she victim i understand robbery mugging something your honor case charged she disgruntled the clerk court agrees disgruntled person in fact unfortunate happened happened the warrant recall order gotten chicago police department the facts case clear victim mugging she fact initially charged criminal defendant deceptive practices case respondent but arising theft credit cards assuming allegations complaint taken true yes correct but even set facts must go back allegations complaint the allegations complaint clearly reflect respondent acknowledges clerk acting official aide judge acted discharge judicial duties implement court orders respondent seeks case clerk create perfect procedures impossible imperfect world immunity recognizes mistakes occur and especially large metropolitan court system like one circuit court cook county 2100 deputy clerks 6 municipal districts likelihood one mistake thousand like happening happen without judicial immunity clerk would subject to leave duties thus impair effective administration justice circuit court mr mayer point really dont know happened resolved summary judgment we know relevant beyond facts theyre stated complaint happened we know happened clerk the clerk created procedures court promote efficient management court system whether clerk tenth floor mislaid file intentionally negligently whether chicago police department failed execute procedures relevant question whether clerk absolutely immune official aide job promote efficient management judiciary we would ask court reverse seventh circuits decision extend absolute judicial immunity court clerks i would ask remaining time i reserved yes your honor mr chief justice may please court clearly face complaint petitioner case could done creating procedures conjunction general order case furthermore courtroom deputy case followed procedures assigned allegations deputy clerk involved case comply implement procedures as far intentional violation court orders clear clerk court amenable alternative available remedies intentionally violates court order he subject answerable court he subject contempt he subject removal office well judge addition would subject criminal analogue section 1983 act section 242 criminal intentional violations civil rights the clerk would enjoy greater immunity judge prosecutor would intentional violations furthermore clear negligent act occurred mere inadvertent mislaying warrant recall order something could prevented even threat memo mistakes happen large system one cook county merely fact memo something even could prevent one isolated incident clearly clerk intimately related court he acting independent court as court held shadwick versus city tampa clerk working court intimately related court he judicial officer acting supervision judge accorded protection absolute judicial immunity judge would judge fact performed act failing case either adequately communicate police department warrant recall order fact created procedures for reasons weve asked seventh circuit court appeals reversed,97.0,19,1,we hear arguments next finley murray you may proceed whenever youre ready mr elson thank gentlemen the case submitted,1597.0,2219,24,mr chief justice may

alleged resulted petitioners continued implementation policies customs knew inadequate mr justice stevens pointed reading complaint mr elson suppose situation instead hundreds clerks office justice peace judicial officer country clerk staff secretary postulate facts happened sent something sheriff police went fishing forgot put drawer mislaid would judge absolute immunity the opinions court question recent question clear well whats general proposition judicial immunity the general proposition court would look nature duty administrative duty judicial immunity simply wouldnt apply since court determined well strunk case shed light answer question shouldnt im sorry stump strunk stump stump versus sparkman yes in stump versus sparkman court one requirements judicial immunity court act within jurisdiction it seems clear context case court referring jurisdiction sense jurisdiction decide cases and i think interpretation augmented courts recent decision dennis versus sparks court held purpose judicial immunity judicial immunity arose order protect judges ability exercise independent judgment merits cases  the precedent direct precedent subject dates back 1879 case ex parte virginia court explicit saying court explicit saying necessary look actual function performed judge judge performs function could well handled anybody case purely ministerial duty judge immunity simply title status of course mandamus action that mandamus action thi court looked policies mandamus immunity terms injunctive relief damages cases related in case indication court would different view terms damages certainly case i would even hazard reasons injunctive relief might even stronger damages is position counsel clerk would entitled qualified immunity failure refusal perform mandatory duty no your honor its position facts case premature determine whether immunity would appropriate judge swygert just abstract terms reference determination facts case assuming clerk failed refused perform mandatory duty if mandatory view th appropriate would appropriate if mandatory duty ministerial nature immunity would appropriate and court courts decisions dealing question immunity held fundamental purpose immunity protect officials discretion ability exercise discretion independently where discretion fundamental purpose immunity disappears judge swygert opinion noted fourth circuit held leading opinion mccray versus maryland judge swygerts opinion concurring opinion im sorry in concurring opinion noted referred mccray versus maryland fourth circuit also holding and line historical do understand remand trial i gather order court appeals wasnt thats correct is issue immunity open yes the court appeals remanded ground factual clarification necessary determine whether official immunity appropriate cited previous seventh circuit case now say whether official immunity in form absolute well court indication reference previous case dieu versus norton in case court determined court clerk absolute immunity actually carrying orders judge acting pursuant legal duties so implication seventh circuits remand would remand factual determination whether clerk fact acting pursuant judicial and immunity and question immunity unclear all judge swygerts concurrence says immunity would appropriate of course also referring problem whether negligence appropriate are suggesting remand determination ought immunity trial judge would determine whether going qualified the trial judge would determine whether theres qualified immunity no theory wasnt acting within scope authority something like well immunity theory performing purely ministerial function ministerial office and disecretion whatsoever and ministerial proposition immunity ministerial functions fits within historical background section 1983 one requirements proving absolute immunity section 1983 show petitioner burden showing equivalent immunity 1871 section 1983 enacted mr elson leave question remand correct three alternatives rather two even view law one would mere ministerial act would immunity and extreme hes carrying direct order judge exactly judge tells i think probably would agree thats absolute immunity no i would order case chief judge purely administrative order position well let put little differently would situations clerk nothing carry direct order judge would entitled absolute immunity definitely all right but intermediate category might hes carrying direct order might performing discretionary act drafting new procedures something like might recognize qualified immunity thats correct and conceivably could case one questions whether procedures reasonable thats correct and recent decisions though historical decisions would indicate qualified immunity would appropriate so actually remand one three alternatives least conceivable thats correct if affirm remand need determine immunity hes entitled thats correct exactly mr elson i take court appeals opinion issue liability opposed immunity isnt totally resolved court appeals as i read author opinion kind treats case like hunting accident said know one five people must liable go back figure but irrefutably foreclosed clerk might held liable oh definitely thats closed seventh circuit i think clear but course issue presented right case going back historical equivalent immunity i would emphasize court made clear without equivalent historical equivalent immunity common law officials claim absolute immunity must fail literal terms section 1983 require allinclusive scope liability must give effect without background equivalent immunity and law nineteenth century absolutely clear best stated courts 1870 decision amy versus supervisors court held court held officials even good faith immunity negligence carrying duties and theres reason law clear court clerks exempted rule official liability theres dispute case mandatory duty court clerk and stated appendix page 23 stated suppose clerk mandatory duty send form along warrant recall form along negligence one deputies suppose facts pure case negligence now wasnt footnote court appeals opinion that wouldnt negligence would amount 1983 violation thats correct view seventh circuit prior courts decision parrot versus taylor yes which indicated that longer law terms negligence sufficient state claim section 1983 suppose clerk negligently fail carry requirements quite adequate set procedures regulations judge worked on face theyre perfectly right he negligently failed carry and hes sued 1983 stating cause action facts show negligent now kind immunity would say would enjoy im sure whether hypothetical talking deputy clerk failed actually physically get document police chief clerk responsible procedures either one either one well either case would would position would absolute immunity because negligently failed carry order i believe question youre asking goes whether theres constitutional violation could well no question doesnt i thought went constitutional violation lets assume negligent conduct may nevertheless amount constitutional violation assume now question immunity well position nature constitutional violation affect determination whether heres immunity those wholly separate questions given immunity case sufficiently severe violation rise constitutional proportions so so would put category ministerial act failed carry yes i so immunity its unclear but duty spelled chief judges order quoted page 23 appendix says three times actually the clerk shall deliver warrant recall order central warrant unit  it couldnt explicit regard well remand did majority court appeals decide might immunity even though ministerial act no i dont believe court appeals reached level inquiry case there simply factual development determine whether violation possibly whether fact clerk may acted pursuant adequately acted pursuant commands judge counsel think mere negligence rises constitutional violation 1983 well i think certain situations i believe court already decided parrot decision again however i would emphasize that question raised case certainly court could find negligence rise constitutional violation issue absolute immunity given constitutional violation even petitioner able show common law background absolute immunity petitioner could meet second burden independent burden establishing immunity immunity essential proper performance court clerks duties petitioner explanation absolute immunity essential performance court clerks duties hand court held immunity essential performance duties governor school board members hospital administrators prison administrators policemen if cabinet officers thats correct and petitioners duties case anything ministerial certainly executive administrative nature therefore deserve immunity administrative executive officials indeed i would argue deserves less immunity normally court clerks perform less discretion duties say governors cabinet officers et cetera petitioners primary policy argument weve heard clerks serve aide judge important judicial proceedings well court made clear official immunity depends officials status location judicial process whether judgments official functionally comparable judgments judge deciding cases court pointed dennis opinion since petitioners responsibility unconstitutional arrest case failing adequate procedures nothing deciding merits case functional comparability argument ground conclusive judicial immunity cannot apply petitioner in gravel case extended immunity primarily senator senatorial aide would think judicial immunity might least rub judges secretary judges law clerk well insofar judges secretarys law clerks duties concerned merits case actual case adjudicative process definitely if routine administrative duties although question course court i would assert rationale judicial immunity simply would apply and feel court clerk sufficiently removed beyond intimate connection judge rub court clerk yes terms deciding case the court clerk anything deciding case in certain cases hes supposed thats correct however certain cases court clerks ar given authority perform may called quasijudicial kinds functions like deciding appropriateness probable cause arrest th appropriateness bonds and i think quasijudicial immunity might apply judgelike decision case do think theres remedy clerk conduct state law the statute provides remedy i know cases damages actually collected illinois statute but would think declaration clerk immunity state law certainly implicit judgment illinois legislature immunity necessary court clerks functions and think relevance immunity question 1983 i definitely although immunity federal law matter martinez versus california indicates certainly well question construction 1983 congress might intended passed whether intended revoke common law immunities but common law certain state suddenly changed changed statute otherwise immunity clerk would otherwise state suddenly eliminated state legislature federal courts 1983 well i think would simply reinforce proposition valid policy reasons well lets say clear decision federal courts state a court clerks immune absolutely immune and theres statute passed state a says immunity dont need kind immunity and theres 1983 suit brought state clerk similar would immune well i think one could rely section 1988 title 42 argue federal law deficient respect doesnt provide way immunity would look state law effectively serves purposes federal statute and case would look state laws abrogation immunity i would point law illinois indicate clerks even immunity type situation illinois line states indicating court clerks immunity none whatsoever qualified otherwise well ministerial duties immunity well nonministerial i dont know cases deal discretionary duties yes illinois statute suppose one clerks i think suggested might fix bond example determine probable cause substitution local magistrate suppose impermissible way could liable statute state court under statute cited brief indicates clerk would civilly responsible failures clerk and would judicial act wouldnt that well could there also statute illinois gives immunity discretionary acts officials governmental functions states and illinois would interplay two statutes unclear case i would also point case new case cited petitioner new illinois supreme court decision points 1870 i believe illinois constitution promulgated court clerks considered even nonjudicial officers court county officials so didnt even proximity law time 1983 enacted petitioner also argues immunity necessary promote judicial efficiency well opposite true the protection constitutional rights promotion judicial administration clearly mutually reinforcing goals antagonistic the facts case i believe demonstrate possibility clerks liability constitutional arrest caused ineffective procedures handling warrant recalls would two effects it would incentive efficient procedures thereby reduce incidence unconstitutional arrest and i think interesting note petitioner recognized effect 1983 liability office memo clerk thats page 20 appendix memo warns deputies failed follow correct procedures handling recall orders may subject well may subject clerks office liability section 1983 if liability encourages petitioners subordinates thank your honor mr chief justice may please court before recessed lunch i discussing absolute immunity necessary promote judicial efficiency and i pointing petitioners memo clerks subordinates showed recognition 1983 liability indeed incentive promote efficient judicial procedures and i would point incentive petitioners subordinates theres reason think wouldnt incentive petitioner use adequate procedures there third criteria establishing absolute immunity damages petitioner must show adequate safeguards built process court clerk official acts reduce need damage 1983 damage remedy this court never found absolute immunity justified unless adequate adequate safeguards built process official acts and safeguards described economou versus butts essential ones right adversarial hearing right appeal recourse precedent petitioners failure adequate safeguards purely administrative adequate procedures handling recalls purely administrative type action occurred wholly outside adjudicative process so possibility safeguards present therefore theres need theres reduction need section 1983 damage remedy restrain constitutional violations and independent requirement absolute immunity petitioner burden showing existence safeguards in response petitioners argument i would point essentially i think petitioner conceded question presented whether hes entitled absolute immunity response justice oconnors question whether whether clerk would immune clerk violated court order discriminated individual in conceding would immunity case i think essentially essentially concedes question presented i think concession dictated sum three separate requirements absolute immunity court set immunity cases adequate safeguards policy reasons make immunity necessary accomplishment officials duties equivalent historical immunity background in words youre saying must something paralleling kind derivative immunity defined gravel senators aide performing legislative task way gravel limited immunity immune if performing something essentially senator would thats right derivative immunity thats correct i dont know i would phrase derivative immunity there must clerk must perform function its certainly derivative immunity gravel case thats correct legislative aide performing task would immune legislator performed derivative immunity court clerk however would judicial type action it would related carrying judges order therefore almost arm judge if issued clerk issued authorized issue warrant subpoena would say quasijudicial subject immunity the task wouldnt quasijudicial functionally like deciding cases there would derivative immunity absolute immunity i think term quasijudicial used many senses would absolute immunity hed carrying explicit order judge and sense i think gravel case indicates court clerk happens aide judge legislative aide aide senator status confer immunity there functional equivalence because petitioner met three separate requirements absolute immunity court set forth basis claim absolute immunity case,32.0,14,1,well resume 100 oclock mr elson may resume very well do anything mr mayer,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0,-2,270.0,65.0

passes outside protection patent act it available used purchaser practice invention now whats invention the invention bit dna asserted soy bean seed makes seed plants grow seed resistant active ingredient roundup now way practice invention plant seed grow seeds i agree one would i dont think situation i think we explained respondents protect invention contracts they dont sell outright they sell agency model i think important correct well part patent policy well protect purchaser thats part courts law 150 years under respondents theory farmer grows soy bean seed infringing patent grace monsanto and thats  lot farmers country 90 percent acreage roundup ready so monsantos theory really limit exhaustion doctrine is infringing license monsanto lets take first the reach monsantos theory seed sold even though title passed farmer farmer assumes risks associated farming still control ownership seed control seed used thats correct your honor dont apply  exhaustion eliminated rather progeny seed taking away ability people exchange goods freely commerce you essentially servitude things exchanged every grain elevator makes sale infringing if assume exhaustion seeds sold farmer  lets take particular case mr bowman went grain elevator bought grain elevator without restriction seeds  purpose plant now way make use  assume first instance exhaustion seeds mr bowman purchased grain elevator taking away ability use seed use invention lets take example claim 130 supplemental appendix 19 method selectively controlling weeds field it two elements first element planting crop seed particular crop seed particular genetics encode resistance roundup next step apply crop weeds field sufficient amount glyphosate herbicide now say exhaustion seeds mr bowman purchased grain elevator say doesnt apply progeny allowing actually practice invention grow seeds no well i guess i misunderstood question justice breyer response applied law way side making use eliminating exhaustion doctrine context  patented seeds youre saying anything practice invention justice ginsburg point invention if look claim 130 example saying cant practice claim 130 certainly embodied seeds purchased grain elevator no well practical matters doesnt work way seed thats available grain elevator good source seed farmers going able eliminate need go monsanto seed companies every year going grain elevator great evidence fact client every year planted second crop using grain elevator seed bought high quality seed pioneer now grain elevator  grain elevator seed good didnt use first crop your honor thats exception exhaustion doctrine selfreplicating inventions the invention it this  court  created exception exhaustion doctrine fact explicitly said wont thats act  thats activity congress this obviously brandnew case dealing  doctrine patent exhaustion context selfreplicating technologies so take federal circuits view  exhaustion someone practice invention sure things talked mr breyer  justice breyer nothing  invention so youre taking exhaustion doctrine selfreplicating inventions youre modifying courts case law substantially thats something ought done congress in fact the exhaustion doctrine policy underlies courts cases fundamentally choice purchasers rights personal property patentees rights monopoly use monopoly increase sales this court always chosen purchasers rights patentees rights increase sales and asking make choice first disagree activity basic farming could considered making invention if read statute says making invention making copy like would copyright act we invention particular genetic sequence made principally monsantos genetic engineers and farmers plant seeds dont exercise control dominion  crop otherwise every year theyd bumper crop they absolutely they absolutely work dont control creative process they plant spray pray they certainly arent control you ask farmer whos lived drought terrible flood say theyre ones making absolutely and  thats broad position it doesnt matter come possession seeds you committing patent infringement  cell division patent infringement thank justice breyer what monsanto wants scenario want farmer assume risks farming they want  still want control act owners property owned doubt farmer when farmer grows progeny seed insure risk theyre going crop first place if drive grain dealer sell harvest  get one paycheck year way  they get wreck thats monsantos problem thats farmers problem so theyre essentially asking for farmers bear risks farming yet sit back control property used and thats fundamentally inconsistent court interpreted exhaustion doctrine the thing thats important license outright sale farmers first generation and  plant seeds exhaustion doctrine right use invention progeny seeds owned outright every farmer assume risk loss so   monsanto wants control its servitude title and things get sold grain elevators every time grain elevator makes sale technically infringing and  thats something law never allowed centuries and one main problems farmers main livelihood sell seeds grow now dont clear title dont ability sell property  grow impinges upon ability make living you know farmers growing soybeans  seed there various types various types farmers  growing foundation seed example close  first generation seed thats engineered they i dont know answer question taking example  petitioner bought commodity seeds undifferentiated mixture cant overemphasized different every single seed dont know monsanto pioneer asgrow you dont know maturity rate if i farmer i need particular maturity bean field i dont want mature gets high enough combine come around cut so want able  things dialed different variabilities so go grain elevator dont know exactly want get mixture thats going real  competitive monsantos first generation seed now possibility somebody selecting one saying ah thats exact one i need field im going cultivate let grow enough seeds i plant first crop would take number years grow 1000acre farm  time farmers  nature would changed evolved would want latest disease resistance point so well no actually something quite different he didnt select particular variety he selected particular trait roundup ready probably dozen different ways seed vary  disease resistance maturity rates and farm thats correct but look field youve planted grain elevator seed going different colors theyre going different varieties theyre going mature different rate so  comes harvest time going close ground combines going miss including monsanto seeds absolutely its problem time this poor choice  choice seed makes sense plant risky situation like farmer washed flood example late yes im sorry i must misunderstood question the commodity seeds  roundup ready commodity seeds grow different rates different disease resistance different maturity rates correct so exactly theyre uniform variety they exactly farmer needs thats correct it makes sense i mean allow seeds dumped common grain elevator they dont put restrictions elevator there restrictions client purchased grain elevator so less problem monsanto people going grain elevator plant nevertheless  outright sale exhaustion applies particular sale permits farmer use its never going threat monsantos business people planting grain elevator seed now answer question justice kagan  well theory somebody breach contract monsanto dont contract law actually agency model like general electric 1920s and thats fair agent growers assuming  well monsanto assuming risk farmers and equitability  risk sharing farmers monsanto now want farmers take risks associated farming yet want control use seeds way distribution chain i reserve balance time id like first address statement traditional farming practice it may occasional farmer real desperate situation may apply mr bowmans situation wanted cheap source seed second crop but record 153a among places discusses hes gone grain elevator years number times farmers gone grain elevator generations so ruling favor monsanto would effectively eliminate seed no i and referring state labeling laws prevent grain elevators actually scooping grain packaging saying seed look alike  eye and grain elevators certainly allowed dupe seed purchasers laws protect seed purchasers mr bowman bought grain without restrictions could use that broke laws violate pvpa i mean monsanto didnt assert pvpa certificate surely did assert case could assert case theres single variety mr bowman planted so thats good argument that case point your honor that 271f actually came side restrictive patent rights and like software this invention way use invention  repeat way use invention  plant grow seeds so dont apply exhaustion doctrine allow someone use youre choosing patent rights personal property rights thats never done 150 years courts exhaustion cases that certainly use invention well thats use thats use invention justice breyer and exhaustion conferring purchaser right use invention theres limit monsantos the argument came quanta your honor there uses computer chips course asserted and key computer chips practiced patent and would swallow exhaustion doctrine entirely could think uses things sold the key use  purchaser allowed use invention and monsantos theory purchaser isnt allowed and thats exhaustion doctrine but use invention plant thats use mr bowman makes so  judgment case based acres planted im sure many  talked bit n plus 2 generation dont know record n plus 2 generation terms sales yields that wasnt district court summary judgment so im sure could affirm based judgment finding conditional sales prevented application exhaustion doctrine the thing could ask but youre saying theres exhaustion progeny owns seed outright with well submit well ask court appeals reversed thank you,925.0,1216,35,we hear argument next morning case 11796 bowman v monsanto company mr walters why world would anybody spend money try improve seed soon sold first one anybody could grow many seeds want thats true thats true case patented article right so patent system based i think recognition contractual protection inadequate encourage invention i didnt understand last sentence any farmer plants grows soybeans violating patent i thought claim violates patent tries grow additional seeds first crop right isnt claim no seed its different seed that seed done its planted ground grown seed its seed talking its seed sold right i think may right way characterize monsantos argument i great difficulties characterizing way justice scalias question indicates but monsanto still prevail say theres patent infringement plants seed uses seed replant thats far monsanto goes seems one way characterize argument make sensible no allowing use seeds anything else wants it nothing seeds there three generations seeds maybe three generations seeds enough laughter it example first monsanto first generation sold they children second generation and children children third generation okay so bad joke so talking  wants first generation anything wants and moreover buys monsanto make new seeds he make generation two theyve licensed here buys generation two now wants seeds but ill tell problem coming third generation infringement so second generation seeds nothing if went room box bought lab put rocks said hocuspocus lo behold came third generation seeds would infringed monsantos patent third generation would no wouldnt you mean goes finds new way making seeds happens pick grass intertwine various things like lo behold perfect copy monsantos patented seed hasnt made hasnt infringed why my question grass magic box i saying problem i think infringement lies fact made generation three it nothing generation two that coincidence but fact way made seeds but sell resell generation 2 whatever wants if sterilizes uses circus the thing cannot cannot create generation 3 couldnt use generation 2 seeds rob bank you know certain things law prohibits what prohibits making copy patented invention and so generation 3 concerns us and thats end now response but but  said making use isnt eitheror thing  side pointed you use seed make new seeds so use make arent  either use make you use make new item well suppose  never bought monsanto seeds he goes grain elevator 90odd percent seeds genetic composition so  planted harvested would infringing monsantos patents so never buy seed monsanto im still getting answer im going try now buy generation 2 well lot things you feed animals feed family make tofu turkeys i mean know lot things right but ill give two cant one cant pick seeds youve bought throw childs face you cant theres law says cant now theres another law says cannot make copies patented invention and law violated use make generation 3 violated law assault use commit assault now i think thats federal circuit trying get and really nothing exhaustion doctrine it doctrine perhaps  somehow think give right use something basic purpose making copy maybe i dont see where law yes is is  exhaustion doctrine im sorry the exhaustion doctrine permits use good buy it never permits make another item item bought so thats i think justice breyer saying use seed plant cant use progeny unless licensed progeny new item well said  havent case involving selfreplicating i mean exhaustion doctrine shaped idea article article could use use used but havent applied exhaustion doctrine new  create copy original so  law place weve dealing item exhaustion doctrine hundreds items thousands items growing original seed well except extent justice breyer suggested except extent purchase going use article create new one exact kind and seems youre suggesting basic rule says purchaser get exception selfreplicating technologies do mean dont work dont lay soil nutrients needs water needs watering protect animals they work growing seed im sure dont things i said doesnt grow so arent involved creative  creation well need one  i mean throw seeds ground one two going grow still case right thats true thats i thought going respond i thought going respond question makes infringement client buys generation 1 monsanto buy generation 1 monsanto plant ground lo behold comes generation 2 and generation 2 basis i asking much violation but i think though ill find response yes youre right much violation thats monsanto give buyer license and seems work you dont need exception theres exception anything when create new generation made patented item cannot without approval patent owner therefore monsanto gives approval buy generation 1 now seems work without need exception and im putting whole thought respond and may  may doesnt mean infringing they may  seeds owned farmer but uses grow seeds hes infringing patent so i dont think ownership anything i one question far farming question with crops going make seeds leave crop longer in  soybeans if farmer north 40 south 40 north 40 hes going plants soybeans used flour human consumption south 40 wants seeds does leave plants ground amount time you would okay i dont understand i thought soybeans seeds but thats  youre going use soybeans seeds opposed flour leave ground longer okay mr walters go back chief justices opening question chief justice asked incentive monsanto would produce kind product right and said well protect contract actually seems that answer purely insufficient kind case happen one seed escapes web contracts seed selfreplicate way essentially makes contracts worthless so back chief justices problem monsanto would incentive create product like one please correct i wrong i thought thats exactly bowman he went grain elevator  used seeds  didnt know exactly percentage mix used so exactly said uneconomical im sorry maybe i didnt read right i thought plant commodity seeds applied roundup left roundup readyresistance seeds used including monsanto seeds some would  would grow different rates others how come thats problem first time plant no i mean first time get nothing monsanto ready  roundup ready seeds plant are telling us problem growing different rates so doesnt make commodity seeds different but original batch buys monsanto the original batch buys monsanto addition resistant chemical kills weeds addition mature rate so monsanto seeds  fungible there mature early mature later thank counsel ms sherry do agree unlawful grain elevators sell replanting what  mr waxmans suggestion weve already decided microsoft v att dont people animals eat well way plant that isnt thing could you buy grain elevator sell things the invented thing the invented aspect seed gene repels insecticide something i understand you dont use i dont think used particular  well go ahead you go ahead the people buying grain elevators mostly people take chips  whatever seeds  sell making tofu sell eat  loads uses arent yes  thats  nothing prevents planting what prevented using  consequences planting second generation seeds another planting thats prevented he plant harvest eat sell he cant plant harvest replant im sorry i didnt follow answer justice scalias question you know youre saying preventing using hes prevented using he use meant for raising crop he cannot use product  new crop  replanting thats he sell new crop feed purpose but say  hes prevented using bought simply true he use plant harvest crop thank counsel the case submitted,1345.0,1776,18,mr chief justice may please court let start answering couple i guess science technology questions came launching doctrinal position first justice kennedy soybeans soybeans they harvested particular point time whatever use going made it plant like flower geranium example left go seed alfalfa the bean seed all soybeans processed used way if going planted cleaned put ground right time if fed either humans animals processed way eliminates enzyme makes indigestible animals justice scalia question well farmers cant second plantings soybeans put huge grain elevators different varieties mingled true sense one soybeans protected patent actual growing use patented inventions without license would infringement although course glyphosate put top neither farmer monsanto would ever know act infringement but point farmers  i mean planting second crops crop rotation interspersing soybeans winter wheat very common there hundreds thousands soybean farmers every year mr bowman acknowledged far knows hes one whos way but plenty ways could obtain much less expensive crop  know particular variety soybean one grow height germinate time and fact explained district court response motion summary judgment page 152a joint appendix he said defendant wanted cheap source seed second crop beans normal risks growing “ wheat beans ” second crop follows harvesting winter wheat quote defendant simply wasnt going plant high priced soybean seed wheat crop  and heres relevant sentence defendant could purchased conventional seed nonpatented seed saved offspring wheat beans  in words could gone bought nonpatented  bag nonpatented seed much less money used second crop harvested portion  soybeans replicate rate 20 80 times generation  perpetual source second crop thereafter exactly justice ginsburg  glyphosate resistance doesnt change yield particular plant changes way control weeds and would able use monsantos technology would allow aerial application herbicide he would  wanted buy plain old know conventional soybeans control weeds conventional way and heres next sentence response court “ defendant ”  instead purchasing conventional seeds saving says defendant decided purchase grain dealers commodity grain felt good chance would obtain mostly grain would resistant glyphosate  therefore could use monsantos technology without pay mr chief justice question new case  let go first first question case would company ever want i think answer without ability  lets talk soybeans broaden kinds readily replicable technologies  without ability limit reproduction soybeans containing patented trait monsanto could commercialized invention never would produced popular agricultural technology america ms sherry pointing sale first roundup ready soybean seed trillions roundup ready soybean seeds existence derive would mr bowmans theory fully exhausted monsantos rights seed sold progeny unto  however many generations justice breyer thinks “ many ” i think important understand technology works the department agriculture licensed monsanto engage transformation event introduce recombinant gene soybean germ plasma its illegal unless get government license and and done technology company use  taking something whats called gene gun using gene gun inject recombinant dna regular germ plasma the  department agriculture authorized monsanto engage  transform natural  natural plant material recombinant gene one single event referred transformation i think may able shoot several  i dont know whether shoot whole round whatever but event one event laughter i mind trying figure gene gun looks like and i dont know  i dont know could use rob bank but point   federal register site transformation event respect roundup ready  provided footnote brief what happens monsanto uses transformed cells grow soybean plant and soybean plant produces genetic  produces seeds soybeans recombinant roundup ready technology monsanto provides  almost cases monsanto engages licensed sales transformed seeds hundreds different seed companies produce different varieties make conventional seed particular varietal makeup roundup ready version variety monsanto provides soybeans transformed seed companies hundreds seed companies consideration under mr bowmans theory monsantos rights respect technology the first time took original transformed seed sold seed company could bulk crossbreed produce different varieties monsanto lost patent rights in words go  committed hundreds millions dollars 13 years develop technology first sale article practices patent would exhausted rights perpetuity now certainly let make  let make three points starting edamame moving inadvertent infringers edamame immature form soybean seed you plant edamame if i take  know girl scout troop science experiment rot generate and well also reminds original answer justice kennedy wrong edamame taken pods  thing becomes actually seed processed way your point ubiquity roundup readys use fair one i mean probably rapidly adopted technological advance history the first roundup ready soybean seed made 1996 and grown 90 percent 275000 soybean farms united states but size  success  never thought cant thought affect contour patent rights you may  soybeans problem blowing seed issue soybeans soybeans dont  i mean would take hurricane sandy blow soybean farmers field and soybeans event  know perfect flowers contain pollen stamen  reason breed free true unlike example corn the point may many farmers respect crops like alfalfa may inadvertent roundup ready alfalfa fields may true although  well documented there would inadvertent infringement farmer cultivating patented crop would enforcement the farmer wouldnt know monsanto wouldnt know event damages would zero would ask reasonable royalty would farmer doesnt want roundup ready technology isnt using roundup ready technology save costs increase productivity  royalty value would zero mmhmm well so infringement  unlike contributory infringement induced infringement act infringement violation section 271 strict liability tort requires affirmative volitional contact  conduct that  thing doesnt infringe person infringes the person i mean take sure of course i mean take example goes i think comment made chief justice even software context havent case yet you case  microsoft v att involved know microsofts golden disk windows operating system patented exported overseas introduction know computers manufactured overseas and atts patent method compressing speech practiced windows software and court held although writing windows operating system computers united states would infringed patent microsoft infringe atts patent fact copies made onto hard drives computer overseas meant act infringement occurred overseas export  infringing product purposes infringing overseas purposes section 271f so i think decided context software course replicates even readily soybeans vaccines cell lines plasmids copies actually made  software written onto hard drive computer different thing disk sent infringing occurs within united states so one okay let  let answer question way first dont think theres need whatsoever court  agree government theres need court address question conditional sales extent patent law recognizes circumstances conditional sales case federal circuit address ground advocated still advocate instead said  im reading 14a petition appendix even monsantos patent rights commodity seeds exhausted conclusion would consequence grower like bowman plants commodity seeds containing monsantos roundup ready technology next generation seed develops grower created newly infringing article  in words federal circuit decided entirely correct affirmed basis youre calling i think generation 3 lets say simplicitys sake since generation 1 original soybean sold monsanto seed companies lets say bags soybean seeds farmers go purchase seed dealers called generation n licensed produce generation n plus 1 but n plus 2 so federal circuit held n plus 2 never sold it created exists without sale sale sine qua non patent exhaustion also referred first sale exhaustion alternatively federal circuit said event even exhaustion applies privileges using selling article sold your honors questions pointed originally never privileges making new infringing product if youre referring generation n plus 2 answer yes newly infringing products exhaustion monsantos rights consequence farmers authority use make sell offer sell without monsantos authorization that  straightforward application section 271 okay i im  i agree dont need reach prong shouldnt well i think i think  i think appropriate case come important determine and third argument wasnt addressed federal circuit isnt necessary affirm conditional sales ipso facto unenforceable  instant  everybody understands instead selling technology lease sign license imposes conditions lease know unless unreasonable conditions reasonably related exploitation invention enforceable mr bowman acknowledges everyone acknowledges our single submission technology cannot leased consume whatever use one makes therefore  article embodying invention sold invention cannot commercialized  inventor realize full costs development reasonable rate return first sale fact necessary sale order commercialize invention cannot ipso facto make conditions unenforceable and thats  reach conditional sale issue case think case stands and reason i think yes i think reason take soybean area lets look vaccines because roundup ready gene essentially immunizes soybean plants herbicide way lifesaving vaccine immunize individuals receive external  wouldnt herbicide  life threat okay vaccines live they live cultures regenerate if company develops vaccine know h1  i shouldnt using  important lifesaving vaccine laughter unsupportable say cannot sell quantity vaccine without exhausting rights i mean scheringplough bristolmyers develops vaccine sells cvs i go get injected havent lost patent rights vaccine cvs cant turn around become competitor yes keep  well keep replicating competition take another example well cvs presumably buying either manufacturer another lab but point take software example i go know staples buy windows operating system disk i dont authority put disk replicator press button make million copies and yeah well let  example comes mind course poor dr chakrabarty know invented new manmade bacteria bacteria replicate unlike soybeans require human intervention i mean notion excuse i mean submission okay heres one i use something doesnt make think covered new article lets say i invent new miraculous new machine i get patent i want people able  im going commercialize im going license people commercialize i want people able study research and like monsanto seeds i sign  i provide copy machine mit researchonly license use machine figure works develop new applications sort stuff if sale exhausting purposes i cant prevent mit third party mit provides machine go competition yes cant lease articles like software know soybeans consume use art experiment well i mean say cant sell so ms sherry pointing that would true even case came another way justice kennedy first grain elevators prohibited state federal law selling seed period they sell  buy grain sell grain they cant sell seed number 2 almost varieties soybeans crop plants currently protected  patent  plant variety protection act as court congress recognized requisites getting certificate  i mean like registration requirement and know jem relevant provision pvpa unlawful divert crops protected pvpa certificate reproductive uses so irrespective whatever happens even 1 percent patented soybeans grain elevator grain elevator cant sell seed federal state seed laws patent variety protection act thats solution farmers like monsanto  like mr bowman simply buy conventional seed multiply know 20 30 40 50 80 times single generation save 180th replant second crop doesnt want buy roundup ready technology second crop use glyphosate aerially unless court questions submit,356.0,557,19,but couldnt put herbicide  couldnt  went bought conventional seeds genetically improved seed  wouldnt  would yield put herbicide killed what mean i dont know one shot gun you cant rob bank though right laughter mr waxman worrisome thing side though and bureau position  capacity make infringers everybody and highlighted actually case successful product large percentage market so  know seeds blown onto farmers farm wind sudden roundup seeds farmer infringing theres 10yearold wants science project creating soybean plant goes supermarket gets edamame turns roundup seeds laughter and know roundup seeds everywhere seems theres 90 percent seeds around so seems though  like pretty much everybody infringer point arent okay ill change hypothetical laughter and i thought i clever laughter well  i mean interesting question imagine  see  answer  really deals  could genetic patents  hosts things selfreplicating and selfreplicating items infringing items end inadvertently place is anything patent law deals is involuntary infringer treated patent law voluntary infringer is  precautions take i mean anything patent law helps right well person plants i mean plants doesnt even know know hes got  imagine lot circumstances would  justice kagans question could apply but youre saying would need modification patent law what  question no no i want go back different question asked question think aspect case licensing aspect i mean i would thought doesnt concern monsantos license generation 1 insofar relevant generation 1 carries license permissive it create generation 2 but  also said something circuit license  restriction implied perhaps  use generation 2 grain elevator creating generation 3 namely cant now  thought circuit theres restriction license doctrine seems say restrict licenses  licenses use product sold and would seem contrary first sale doctrine could  could prevail case focused use rather make mr waxman i want go back justice breyers question reformulate different question i think answer i want make sure government exactly page both suggesting i think  ms sherrys last response  explicit enough quanta dont address whatever lingering confusion federal circuit may respect conditional sales case youre  youre telling us dont need reach prong shouldnt i understand dont need question is need generally  clarifying lingering confusion actually different position government simplifying case cant take person whos given vaccine take vials blood keep selling is well works laughter no im serious i mean example seems quite point situation intended use vaccine necessarily results regeneration in hypothetical cvs going lab making right but dont need instance say making new ones its making new ones use old ones prevent done then use word “ use ” then use word “ use ” get place i dont think think example i mean say  i dont think think example win ground produce bad result manufacturer inventor havent treated conditional sale like license im saying cant i cant think one so lease so lease i problem goes back justice scalias example what commodity bin 2 percent patented seeds now get away article saying oh well almost seeds roundup days but lets different commodity three four different patented items 1 percent 2 percent seeds bin you cant  cant sell that seems extreme result you cant sell know going used seeds cant use seeds even though 1 percent seeds thank mr waxman mr walters five minutes remaining,476.0,822,7,mr chief justice may please court id like start talking courts decision jem i think largely resolves case jem patent case issue whether could get utility patent plant the argument couldnt get utility patent plant variety protection act implicitly repealed patent act respect this court rejected argument reason rejected argument found conflict two statutes the reason found conflict two statutes said harder get utility patent reason get greater protection  patent act get greater rights exclusion patent act pvpa and said notably seed saving exemption patent act research exemption patent act the consequence petitioners argument would court would reading seedsaving exemption patent act research exemption would much much much guise patent exhaustion justice breyer pointed exhaustion doctrine really nothing case thats exhaustion doctrine always limited particular article sold talking different article and never extended making new article its true court hasnt exhaustion case specifically involving sort replicating technology court talked exhaustion always focused specific article thats sold done reason the concept underlying exhaustion patentholder controls first sale gets one royalty respect actual article sold petitioners argument isnt limited commodity grain talking its even limited  talk  justice breyer mentioned three different generations seeds there actually quite generations three if concept sale parent plant exhausts patentholders rights respect seed respect progeny seed would go way back first roundup ready plant created part transformation event every single roundup ready seed existence today progeny one parent plant your honor pointed would eviscerate patent protections there would incentive invest roundup ready soybeans even agricultural technology quite bit broader in order encourage investment patent act provides 20 years exclusivity this would reducing 20year term essentially one sale it would near impossible recoup investments first sale likely consequence research dollars would put elsewhere the and answer actually traditional farming practice despite petitioner says farmers generally go grain elevators buy commingled grain plant ground seed if look american soybean association brief submitted behalf soybean farmers says much if look chs brief submitted behalf grain elevators also explains and number reasons case theres reasons petitioner talked undifferentiated mix reasons well the business grain elevators sell commingled grain seed if business would comply seed labeling laws they business model but farmers wouldnt able use another reason well even take patent law put entirely side still plant variety protection act bowman absolutely circumstance but bowman also said aware farmers engaging practice and another reason putting aside labeling laws plant variety protection act pioneer points amicus brief quite likely large amount commingled grain protected patent actually protected plant variety protection certificate petitioner would infringe plant variety protection certificate so even putting patent law side economically viable source seed farmers regardless and petitioners argument isnt limited grain elevators it would apply saving seed planting generation generation it would apply selling seeds neighboring farmer would allow seed companies essentially compete monsanto upon first sale now extent the patent rights exhausted seed time exhausted respect product upon authorized sale and justice breyer right saying want in view authorized sale want respect seed youve actually purchased that tangible article paid but need permission patentholder order make new generation seed to extent know middle ground warranted due respect would point congress appropriate body this court said if monsanto authorizes right so monsanto authorized first sale authorized planting would also authorize sale second generation seed new article and thats exactly happened if look technology agreement  its contract i think significant analysis  monsanto upon first sale bag roundup ready seed authorizes planting one commercial crop authorizes farmer sell commercial crop use purpose replanting that authorized sale so take second generation seed  “ second generation ” bit misnomer take seed follow patent rights respect particular seed exhausted but cannot take seed without separate authorization plant ground come next generation seed that would they exhausted respect particular article sold when courts talked patent exhaustion exhausting rights respect patented invention youre exhausting yes thats always case i sell  i mean even think copyright but i think technology i mean even think software example plenty products one reasonable use make i purchase software one reasonable use would make dozen copies give friends sell ebay its reasonable use infringing one the court hasnt case exactly decide microsoft v att granted slightly different issue case court recognized  case copies master disk treated separate copies actually separate articles even though really easy even though actual copying done human hands done mechanical processes in fact case court talked compared making software reproduction biological processes talking and asking court today  i recognize new technology extent new technologies require different rules congress body making different rules and congress acted area plant variety protection act also software context copyright act adopted wholesale exemption petitioner talking your honor may i i think court need something case i think quanta largely decided issue even though didnt say explicitly far im aware federal circuit applied previous version conditional sale doctrine enforce postsale restrictions since courts decision quanta,160.0,227,5,well i mean  reason never entirely different case its reason intersection exhaustion doctrine  normal protection reinvented articles so i dont think gets far say weve never applied exhaustion doctrine way either we never applied reinvention doctrine articles reinvent like plant seed thats pretty horrible result let give another horrible result  agree farmers able second planting simply getting undifferentiated seeds grain elevator least seeds always patented seeds farmer could ever plant anything grain elevator means  i gather use second plantings risks high doesnt pay buy expensive seed now cant theres practically grain elevator doesnt least one patented seed thats cheap and thats farmers  thats farmers want use cheap planting but correct i wrong i thought bowman so  patent rights exhausted seed im sorry just i follow  i follow answer monsanto sells seed farmer and saying farmer grows seed sell anybody wants right im putting aside contracts stuff that sounds like patent rights havent exhausted you saying exhausted respect one bean thats always case  cases havent involved situation talking selfregenerating product well havent case either im sorry in everything youve said agree mr waxman there issue case disagree conditional sale doctrine i wondering finish could say bit whether doctrine causing trouble presently exists federal circuit in words could ignore doctrine wanted problematic one take opportunity something sure thank

states allow uncapped emotional distress claims privacy act would required state waiver clearly unambiguously statutory text the substantive requirements act sweep far beyond preexisting common law protection privacy impose detailed set new pervasive requirements collection maintenance use dissemination millions federal agency records the act example forbids agencies keeping much information individual compels agencies collect information individual practicable individual sources require agencies safeguard information individual even information otherwise already publicly available congress would taken lightly question whether expose united states expansive damages intentional willful violations novel recordkeeping requirements indeed way district court believes social security administration violated privacy act case something never would actionable common law never would resulted emotional distress recovery well first justice ginsburg i would like respectfully disagree premise question privacy act comparable common law invasion privacy all requirements i described privacy act would existed common law invasion privacy even though common law invasion privacy say compensable emotional distress awards in fact even focus disclosurerelated provision privacy act much broader common law invasion privacy well first your honor sometimes common law pecuniary damages resulting either violation privacy act invasions privacy government sometimes pays large pecuniary judgments but get core question congress might privacy act provided emotional distress award i think text act demonstrates congress thought possibility providing emotional distress award decided initial version act passed 1974 instead version act section 5c2biii assigned privacy protection study commission task making recommendation whether act later expanded provide general damages the commission understood mission  determine whether act ought expanded provide dignitary reputational harms compensation emotional distress and privacy commission understood act enacted provided actual damages interpreted synonymous special damages well your honor your honor term actual injury term actual damages ambiguous terms sometimes might include emotional distress sometimes might he he suffer actual damages within meaning privacy act well your honor i think difficulty question i dont think term actual injury plain meaning context and term privacy act uses actual damages i think context privacy act well contexts well your honors question whether suffered adverse effect within meaning section g1b act yes believe suffer adverse effect sufficient confer standing but court doe described adverse effect requirement simply codifying article iii standing requirements made clear simply plaintiff may suffered adverse effect doesnt mean plaintiff suffered actual damages but justice ginsburg well your honor i hope your honor but   i think get question said doe brief general damages type presumed damages thats correct common law isnt general damages encompasses general damages court recognized doe always presumed sense always assumed  common law definition general damages  always presumed sense always assumed taken place award general damages made even without proof specific harm but cases  common law cases plaintiff introduce evidence extent example emotional distress suffered so wanted say i happy presumed damages would give anybody suffered invasion privacy i particularly sterling reputation i particularly sensitive sort thing i suffered  increased amount harm might presume average person would suffer the award that person would receive well your honor award person would receive additional proof emotional distress would classified general damages now get question actual damages sometimes terms actual damages actual injury used include proven emotional distress term ambiguous we cite cases footnotes 1 2 reply brief term actual damages actual damage used mean exclusively pecuniary harm well cases cases common law sometimes used actual damages sentence reference emotional harm making clear think two types harms separate but your honor maybe i try explain way i think actually respondent implicitly agrees definition general damages including proven harm if look footnote 2 page 20 red brief page 22 red brief definition actual damages respondent offering divides two subcategories special damages general damages everybody agrees special damages limited pecuniary harm respondent makes claim could type damages seeking special damages so extent thinks entitled recovery act thinks emotional distress harm wants prove general damages and theres one thing know definition actual damages act doesnt include general damages congress separately text privacy act assigned privacy protection study commission make recommendation whether act later expanded include general damages your honor dont position point i describe think inquiry would work we think statutes actual damages might context include emotional distress awards but term actual damages waiver sovereign immunity clear unambiguous waiver united states sovereign immunity claims emotional distress and statutes allow claims united states would question context legislative history and would kind workup fair credit reporting act done privacy act case yes your honor multiple courts appeals held questioning conclusion purposes case caveat dont think united states subject suit fair credit reporting act if united states subject suit fair credit reporting act ambiguity meaning actual damages think narrower interpretation limited pecuniary harm would control one distinction fair credit reporting act privacy act i said privacy act specifically carves general damages type damages arent going awarded fair credit reporting act the fair credit reporting act also much permissive remedial scheme allowing certain cases statutory damages also allowing punitive damages i dont think fair credit reporting act various reasons i mentioned particularly good analog privacy act well your honor demonstrated brief  i think id refer court footnotes 1 2 term used common law  term actual damages mean things so fact privacy act  may include emotional distress awards doesnt mean thats sense congress used privacy act  im sorry i may said wrong the fact context fair credit reporting act may include emotional distress doesnt mean thats way congress used privacy act and i think yes your honor if documented medical expenses outofpocket expenses think even arise emotional distress would pecuniary harm could compensated privacy act the emotional distress component cannot medical expenses treat symptoms emotional distress i dont think thats quite correct definition special damages your honor i dont think dispute special damages term context always limited pecuniary harm well your honor common law suit defamation well your honor what said brief common lawsuit defamation per quod two types damages could recovered special damages general damages and  special damages limited pecuniary harm unless plaintiff could prove least special damages wouldnt entitled recovery if plaintiff could prove special damages could recover special damages words pecuniary harm could also recover general damages damages emotional distress dignitary yes your honor i think extent i perhaps disagreeing i understanding say definition special damages term sometimes includes emotional distress awards the term special damages limited pecuniary harm well your honor well your honor court recognized doe structural similarity civil remedies provision privacy act remedial scheme defamation per quod common law and i think one reason might structural similarity defamation per quod common law solves problem congress faced crafting privacy act trying figure plaintiffs injuries sufficiently serious concrete justify award damages i think makes sense court supposed doe congress aware defamation per quod solved problem congress would adopted limitation words requirement showing pecuniary harm threshold requirement privacy act now congress good reason cautious extending scope liability privacy act as i said privacy act regulates great deal conduct wouldnt compensable common law let alone resulted sort emotional distress award now congress recognized i think concerns justice ginsburg justice sotomayor raised plaintiffs might instances deserve recovery emotional distress but recognized arguments sides sides issue and decided privacy act defer issue later assign privacy protection study commission make recommendation whether scope liability act well two points your honor first reference general damages issue privacy protection study commission text act congress enacted 1974 exclusion general damages doesnt depend anything privacy protection study commission said as weight think privacy protection study commission report receive first think telling evidence least ambiguity term actual damages could mean the privacy protection study commission interpreted term actual damages precisely way brief that special damages term understood defamation torts common law privacy protection commission study report makes clear page 530 limited pecuniary harm i think reason thats reasonable reading i think sort judicial restraint embodied canon requires courts construe waivers sovereign immunity narrowly requires court adopt narrower reading shows narrower reading least reasonable one court said nordic village plausible one i  i think would unusual congress silently ambiguously decided open door emotional distress awards privacy act as ive said privacy act quite broad substantive act would exposed government damages  new ways and i think case illustrates  illustrates the district court concluded law enforcementrelated disclosure respondents medical information social security administration fact authorized privacy act routine use published federal register but concluded respondent could nevertheless bring suit federal government privacy act forms filled seeking social security disability benefits didnt adequately disclose information might released government agencies law enforcement purposes i dont think theres reason congress would necessarily think omission government form give rise claim emotional distress damages there certainly wouldnt analogue common law well case your honor plaintiff might claim federal tort claims act based violation state law statutory common law privacy protection so category cases would constituted invasion privacy prior privacy act might still available plaintiff might recover emotional distress damages government well passed your honor wanted wake watergate impose set detailed substantive requirements federal recordkeeping i think  know looking act takes maybe 30 pages petition appendix clearly isnt simply codification common law invasion privacy federal government it much much your honor even look disclosurerelated provision broader common law invasion privacy two important ways so common law invasion privacy plaintiff would prove disclosure personal private information public large under privacy act however disclosure even single person would constitute violation act information doesnt even private let give concrete example so government record contains information someone criminal conviction might violation privacy act contents record disclosed even though someone could obtain information going court records potentially looking internet and particularly since violations federal law typically  typically type relief plaintiff seek violation federal law equitable relief administrative procedure act i dont think theres reason assume congress ambiguously i think really silently decided going ratchet things serious degree expose united states uncapped emotional distress damages privacy act well three points your honor first i think congress thought limitation intentional willful conduct sufficient limitation liability united states wouldnt reluctant provide general damages perhaps even punitive damages second courts appeals generally interpret intentional willful requirement require something slightly less recklessness slightly gross negligence practice provides district courts courts appeals great deal flexibility find intentional willful violations cases federal government doesnt believe liable third extent intentional willful requirement impose limitation plaintiffs recovery actually winds happening practice plaintiffs courts look various technical provisions privacy act try find violation classified intentional willful so example plaintiff information disclosed cant show disclosure intentional willful may try prove violation  e10 requires government safeguard information intentional willful with courts permission i would like reserve balance time thank mr chief justice i points first respondent would like court look  would like court look quote common ordinary meaning actual damages asserts term actual damages fits exactly but court consider issue ever thought meaning actual damages plain you look context and context includes exclusion general damages i think respondent conceded justice alito asked question  includes well your honor i think look sources cited brief well sources cited brief  particular id refer block quote page 22 general damages term typically refers class type damages could presumed could also proven and proven  i think respondent effectively conceded  remain general damages and congress decided think general damages later would great expansion waiver sovereign immunity i dont think act construed allow type emotional distress damages now respondent would like your honor i think thats essentially respondents argument he wants fault congress using specific term special damages but i think flips canon interpreting waivers sovereign immunity head requires congress unambiguously waive sovereign immunity fact i think court precisely opposite i also think justice breyer addressing privacy protection study commission commission included two congressmen sponsored privacy act it agreed reading reading offering actual damages mean general damages mean and  agree statement legislative history adopts definition thats discussed brief now i think respondent essentially wants court adopt recommendation privacy protection study commission act expanded allow special general damages case emotional distress awards would allowed now may good policy arguments privacy protection study commission said judicial restraint embodied sovereign immunity canon i think compels court get ahead congress issue congress didnt provide emotional distress awards passed act 1974 never amended act include act provide emotional distress even physical symptoms emotional distress general damages no matter theyre proved say thats correct your honor theyre general damages first your honor look page 139 dobbs treatise cited brief clearly defines general damages fashion also look second restatement section 621 623 define general  define general damages emotional distress damages context reference proven damages thank you,607.0,744,22,we hear argument next case 101024 federal aviation administration v cooper mr feigin then maybe congress shouldnt passed statute but injury invasion privacy thats something pecuniary damages  prime exist i mean   tort comparable intentional infliction emotional distress the  person subject this embarrassment humiliation doesnt outofpocket costs terribly distressed nervous anxious rest the  act congress reaching impact nature  i mean pecuniary damages know ordinarily attend conduct embarrasses humiliates causes mental distress even  even damages  damages pecuniary kind so could say congress much generous common law impact person suing going outofpocket business loss pecuniary loss going embarrassment humiliation so   congress wanted something impact person given right going something pecuniary damages likely person  plaintiffs situation likely suffer but thats    harm dignitary interest actual injury you describe injury i mean injury emotional distress humiliation actual injury well lets take case did plaintiff suffer actual injury st least allege suffered actual injury i didnt  i didnt ask i asked suffer actual injury opposed someone complaining something  abstract right abstract theory is actual injury you injury first get damages question injury yes im little bit confused brief solicitor generals brief doe described earlier version general damages following way  im quoting brief the general damages provision senate bill likely derived common law tort invasion privacy general damages may awarded  quote  presumed damages without proof harm  so i think doe argued general damages presumed injury but thats different i think question justice ginsburg asking its  i read brief arguments sort  assumption suffer nonpecuniary harm havent injured there big difference presumed damages proven injury in gertz reference common law tort requiring actual proof injury emotional distress most state laws say prove emotional distress we presuming injury so i guess im saying arent one confusing injury presumed damage so different actual injury i  im sleeping i nervous stomach im eating the typical things juries look determine whether proven emotional distress why actual injury i looked cases except two reference wasnt really precise use actual damages particular statute limited pecuniary harms nature harms issue pecuniary nature what actual damages mean fair credit reporting act but mean i think held mean damages dignitary interest mental distress held term held mean fair credit reporting act i were discussing term means term actual damages means are instances invasion privacy documented trauma psychosomatic illness medical expenses lost wages special is actual damage im sorry are arguing emotional distress component cant so youre  i understand definition special damages common law proved pecuniary harm also entitled mental distress damages well so want half common law award  award we may difference history because yes special damages require pecuniary harm prove also permitted recovery nonpecuniary losses well i thought thats brief said actually but talking differently thats i said if sort odd congress borrow defamation context defined term art special damages use privacy act thats intended and use term actual damages much broader meaning special damages well  privacy study commission coming cant say statute means i mean would postlegislative history i mean statute exists study commission see amendments might made but study commission cant decide act means but thats saying didnt good claim relief but lets take worst case  government official spreads kinds false information even true terribly embarrassing information person deliberately lets take case rule covers but wasnt thing congress  pass first place i mean congress thinking emotional distress injuries but it set pretty high bar plaintiff meet plaintiff would prove intentional willful conduct negligence thank counsel mr cardozo counsel seem arguing throughout general damages meant actual damages general damages understanding meant two things presumed actual so illogical congress look general damages meant pick meaning included proven damages actual im still confused general damages meant presumed actual congress says dont want general damages includes presumed so going use word actual how get that congress meant pecuniary i mean  didnt use instead actual damages didnt say pecuniary damages thats intended at common law minute suppose plaintiff proved particular violation privacy terrible bed week couldnt go familys wedding i mean absolute  clearest possible proof now would considered general damages it wasnt presumed it wasnt speculative it wasnt anything its absolute  tied would considered general damages would considered special damages no matter well proved no matter clearly proved no matter clearly proved and  verify i look definition thank counsel counsel the case submitted,1201.0,1600,19,mr chief justice may please court embracing governments view actual damages would mean individuals congress sought protect act would remedy primary form harm well recognized common law act passed to carry acts protective purposes court need give words actual damages common ordinary meaning appears blacks law dictionary proven presumed liquidated punitive forms damages tied proof harm  if affirm proximate causation question arises remand the act requires damages result violation so cannot recover emotional distress followed prosecution but justice ginsburg pointed talking today mr cooper talking every single person act applies whistleblower government chooses silence embarrassing humiliating yes and thats kind thing judges routinely sort for example someone suffers emotional distress lose job thereafter injury produces emotional distress job  job loss wasnt proximate cause judges  fact ask juries in case would judge sifting making determination as happened petitioner does case judge could find emotional distress claim wasnt sufficient reject altogether thats nature emotional distress remedy one thing didnt hear argument almost discussion text act tells least four separate ways actual damages simply means proven presumed damages beginning words thats course common meaning actual damages one appears blacks law dictionary as justice sotomayor pointed term art economic loss arena special damages if thats congress meant presumably would used term common way express one category damages thats economic what would regarded common law presumed  presumed damages act doesnt allow that peeled study right but keeping actual juxtaposition actual general yes correct but interesting thing case didnt take left special damages used different term congress actual term suggests going require proof damages we going presume going allow speculative damages thats true but several things text act tell actual means simply proven presumed if look section 2 congress recites findings statement purposes act right thats described individual personal right privacy well understood well settled time right primarily nonpecuniary nature no our position recoverable actual damages damages prove substantiate judge reject find unsubstantiated happened petitioner does case cant presume no but arena common law presume damages nature violation that carved ability presume rather present evidence subject proof apart obvious post enactment report but   underlying point several things the commission   two paragraphs 620page report doesnt run text act purpose things one normally statutory construction so draw conclusion entirely yes one  one proviso i would add there little bit ambiguity you see privacy commission two pages trying sell congress notion expanding remedy wrote pages 530 reports if rights interests established privacy act worthy protection recovery intangible injuries pain suffering loss reputation chilling effect constitutional rights part protection  there evidence proposition common law privacy cases  surely congress knew thing right surely congress knew thing enacted act mean cut primary form harm another well thats critical understand analysis cant say genuine ambiguity unless understand arrived conclusion the meaning actual damages vary context usually crystal clear context talking in privacy context fairly clear provision page 66a appendix section 2b congress recites purpose remedies provision states the purpose hold united states liable damages occur result  the notable thing statement purpose occur result lines precisely proven presumed damages but damages occur result conflicts directly notion one category damages authorized thats congress statement purpose provision that aligns mr coopers construction aligns the government creates disharmony statute justice breyer given little bit much credit i cant give number states i tell i aware state disallows it far general rule i think universal recovery mental emotional distress invasion privacy i dont know so ill yes today talking narrow category cases intentional willful violation so knew law prevented but  provision covering range intentional willful violations covered act the example whistleblower want silence leak embarrassing details press shaming humiliating front friends family  dont leave house month havent lost job pocket  zero remedy zero thats governments construction and look section 2 congress described act they didnt say imposing picayune technical requirements they saying safeguard individual rights privacy they use lingo analogize unmistakably explicitly common law kind invasion privacy emotional distress routinely recoverable i dont statistics the one thing i tell law fifth circuit well 30 years government  prior doe v chao rule circuits didnt show damages and yet point good 37 years act come existence government sat admitted far broader construction act talking today meaningful effect public this case   coming ninth circuit fifth circuit passed rule in early 80s first recognized emotional distress the case im aware no the highest i think moment case fifth circuit called jacobs federal agency revealed  leaked press information falsely suggesting bank president money launderer he got 100000 emotional distress thats pretty extreme situation the vast majority going modest and i would say get 100000 emotional distress hes upstanding member community hes called common criminal may suffered pecuniary loss suffered actual damages one thing text tells  points points aligned mr coopers construction produce disharmony side look breadth language congress used waive sovereign immunity subsection g act recall governments construction one small category plaintiffs victims intentional willful violations recover yet text says suit court determines theres intentional willful violation united states shall liable actual damages if mean one small category economic damages serving substantial reduction category cases could brought would expect see limitation appear intentional willful suit court determines willful intentional violation plaintiff suffered economic loss substantially narrowing term however actual damages simply means proven presumed wording perfectly natural flows exactly again every place look text act proven presumed  aligns economic square peg round hole text act i would modify slightly what government talking ambiguity abstract they lifting two words context act like phrase actual damages mean different things different contexts but statute run tools construction ambiguous thats  thats actually dont your honor and i would clarify what doctrine sovereign immunity requires waiver expressed text court cant read it cant add words text if  intent separate presumed liquidated punitive forms damages  tethered proof harm actual damages phrase precisely thats actual means means real there ordinary definition actual means pecuniary  get use certain contexts so court doesnt need add expand read anything words actual damages it simply needs give meaning ordinary english definitions blacks law definition this definition court gave actual damages birdsall case 100 years ago thing presumed  proven damages presumed so waiver sovereign immunity expressed doesnt arise implication but one  theres another side sovereign immunity point government never mentions the courts obligation dual when waiver court cant expand waiver neither contract you government spinning theoretical  theoretical possibilities actual damages  used peculiar sense really meant special damages  produce deconstruction statute eviscerates leaves people suffer intentional willful violation without remedy and economic loss get compensation primary form harm privacy absolutely  circles back point youre going  intent say presumed proven actual fits exactly special term wasnt used so  fault congress picking term means precisely proven presumed say werent clear enough thats asking much particularly also said statement purpose spoke remedies provision said damages occur result  they used sweepingly broad language they multiple things say  reveal doubt intent and recall rule morisette molzof case case congress legislating common law background the rule congresss silence taken indication congress intends follow established norms depart congress says actual damages privacy context fair  going assume people going understand common law actual damages included emotional distress privacy violations so rather assuming departed common law typically require contrary direction morisette molzof dont contrary direction and get answer roll you dont need look  go past text get answer roll tools construction common law background morisette molzof rule points place the legislative history this act act emerged compromise far broader remedial scheme authorized punitive damages intentional willful requirement negligence standard measured version the governments construction act throws compromise window rewrites act onesided governments favor clearly happened legislature balance struck another thing legislative history both house senate bills originally term actual damages start actual damages simply counterpart punitive damages again another confirmation actual damages his  economic loss would special damages the damages could prove right the damages could prove would actual damages well could also use actual damages course gertz case court at  common law would general damages they referred study authorized text substantive provision actual damages special damages if congress wanted peel whole piece require economic loss common routine term art used special damages circles back another important point it doesnt include general damages they called presumed damages presumed damages a substantial portion compensation ordinarily available would peeled construction and distinction actually appeared gertz case  placed first amendment limitations recovery court distinguished actual damages presumed damages so i wouldnt say  i would say could call general damages in context act congress choose special damages term authorizing instead chooses broader term actual damages that  exactly position and thing i would add general damages  actual damages statute long general damages surfaced it appeared 11th hour congress said lets send commission thats important keep mind creates huge question congress meant peel there explanation general damages it isnt defined and arose 11th hour but important thing term kept statute special damages the term art pecuniary limitation it kept broader term actual damages term kept aligns statement purpose breadth waiver sovereign immunity nonpecuniary expression  desire protect nonpecuniary interests thats throughout act let wrap couple observations congress passed act restore citizens faith government made solemn promise american citizens cases intentional willful violation united states shall liable actual damages today government proposing actual damages read way renders act virtually irrelevant that makes mockery solemn promise to preserve vitality act court need give actual damages common ordinary meaning proven presumed,609.0,854,34,could i ask question damages client seeking case  affirm ninth circuit would  claiming damages  emotional damages resulted criminal conviction claiming emotional damages would suffered anybody else whose records turned faa operation safe pilot program but allege  mr cooper suffered severe emotional distress confronted fact records turned so youre  youre saying court  remand would separation degree distress suffered result simply knowing somebody faa access social security records disregard distress somebody situation would naturally feel confronted fact criminal violation committed exposed but agree act allow recovery would regarded common law general damages general damages thats term peeled right but general damages term  remedies defamation cases right and two types damages defamation cases special damages general damages  correct and subtract general damages left but problem  definition actual damages general definition actual damages includes things fell within rubric general damages let try one time you  say right recover actual damages right recover general damages so think recoverable actual damages minus general damages but  courts dont  courts allow recovery conjectural speculative damages thats  thats i wrong do federal courts routinely tell juries come conjectural speculative damages thats way jury instructed can tell response governments argument privacy commission set understood word actual damages time way understand what response are right opinion no im asking thank okay so i right saying  would agree that privacy commission understood act opinion privacy commission wrong and pain suffering mean mental pain suffering thank what  government would say   dictionary definitions i dont  i dont think accurate say blacks law dictionary defines actual damages way would defined as i recall briefing gives definitions earlier version blacks whatever but say commission understanding acknowledge contrary understanding actual damages say least shows isnt clear actual damages means and  estimation  establish isnt clear trigger   rule waivers sovereign immunity considered scope except scope clear this would save time possibly guess may know every state many states statutes tort laws something invasion privacy now may know many and  know many thats helpful and know many many perhaps provide damages mental suffering caused violation particular tortlike provision do know anything statistics do know enough know done use term like actual damages run analogous thereto whether special form words okay of course talking statutes require material made public say establish violation one agency provides information another agency i mean government points statute goes far beyond  state statutory common law protections privacy its really picky picky and  say know whatever emotional harm comes  quite different saying state privacy laws emotional distress compensable well thats right but know shouldnt give agency making public you kind thing constitutes invasion privacy state law you failed intentionally failed follow detailed i say picky picky prescriptions contained privacy act to say get emotional distress opposed genuine  i would call genuine privacy incursions state law covers different question do statistics percentage actions brought privacy act plaintiff able establish pecuniary harm you say fifth circuit ninth circuit  many years long time yes are aware runaway verdicts based awards mental damage proof i define runaway awards  six figures or even high five figures in  argument avoid concession term might ambiguous i know position liability damages expressly waived stop  say resist idea definition actual damages unambiguous is fair characterization argument that  thats different point and question went whether acknowledge name unambiguous now government says course  waiver sovereign immunity would acknowledge must unambiguous government says moreover scope waiver  sovereign immunity must unambiguous whether waived respect pecuniary damages also respect emotional harm also must unambiguous  deny second step dont you think you dont the argument made i certainly understand privacy act precisely types damages would concerned really cuts ways i mean saying really big chunk damages whole act seems that argument suggests weight governments point well going get really need clearer waiver sovereign immunity well suppose common lawsuit slander per quod said mr cooper received social security disability benefits now would  claims causes great distress extrinsic fact known pilot therefore people  knew flying around airplane even though severely disabled entitled get social security disability benefits would damage reputation now damages youre seeking emotional distress allegedly incurred would which  category damages would fall then lets you dont claim economic loss no under  would term court  common law court would use actual damages wouldnt ask whether damages reputation emotional distress suffered therefrom either  wouldnt ask whether special general no gertz came common law gertz modification common law what would common law general damages excluded congress right but   elsewhere statute made clear congress think authorizing general damages right because set commission recommend whether general damages included now would purpose commission indeed actual damages already included general damages you  would say actual emotional damages  general damages no  use term general damages makes clear doesnt think statute covers general damages so i think  i think argue term general damages includes presumed emotional harm proven emotional harm okay thank counsel mr

review overturn en banc ruling seventh circuit court appeals petitioner submits undermined courts ruling litigation edelman v jordan established state’s sovereign immunity suit eleventh amendment untied states constitution the en banc ruling seventh circuit authorizes federal court mandate issuance class notice regarding entitlement retroactive welfare benefits twenty thousand welfare recipients relief petitioner contends designed secure indirectly monetary award court prohibited eleventh amendment edelman the facts case dispute in 1971 plaintiff filed civil rights class action district court northern district illinois challenged failure illinois welfare officials comply federal time standards processing applications assistance former title 16 social security act aged blind disabled program federal regulations issued department health education welfare 1968 established specific time standards processing applications from 1968 plaintiff filed lawsuit defendant welfare officials processed applications pursuant state regulations inconsistent federal time standards accordingly district court april 16 1971 preliminarily enjoined welfare officials enforcing state standards compelled follow federal time standards issued hew in march 1972 preliminary injunction made permanent in addition district court awarded equitable restitution retroactive welfare benefits wrongfully withheld applicants aabd applied date issuance federal regulations 1968 april 16 1971 date state regulations declared invalid this award equitable restitution ultimately reversed court edelman v jordan violating state sovereign immunity suit eleventh amendment this court reasoned award equitable restitution practical sense relief state real party interest this court reasoned doctrine ex parte young federal courts remedial powers consistent eleventh amendment limited perspective injunctive relief may include retroactive award relief compensates prelitigation conduct past misconduct completed this court accordingly reversed remanded seventh circuit decision contrary instructions proceedings inconsistent eleventh amendment ruling however remand district court plaintiff filed motion require state defendant issue notice twenty thousand individuals whose applications assistance delayed period 1968 1971 informed possible entitlement retroactive welfare benefits court denied inform right appeal administrative proceedings denials welfare benefits this course states objection violated law case handed edelman violated sovereign immunity embodied eleventh amendment the district court disagreed the district viewed notice relief relief compensate per se edelman limited relief compensated per se relief related possibility securing retroactive monetary award something different actual award on appeal seventh circuit threejudge panel seventh circuit disagreed it found actual notice district court allowed contained predetermination state liability sort notice relief therefore violated law case violated eleventh amendment plaintiff sought rehearing en banc granted the seventh circuit sitting en banc four judges three decided district court fact erred specific notice relief envisioned contain predetermination states liability however seventh circuit sitting en banc feel federal court could authorize notice relief related retroactive welfare benefits long contain predetermination liability the seventh circuit authorizing form notice relief conceded would operate state sovereign merely director department public aid so issue court whether retrospective equitable relief nonconsenting sovereign form notice related retroactive welfare benefits consistent courts decision edelman consistent states sovereign immunity suit eleventh amendment your honor case controversy we significant controversy feel form notice relief case ultimately secure members plaintiff class retroactive benefits denied court either violate courts ruling edelman violate eleventh amendment as matter state law period time mentioned 1968 1971 1974 matter fact illinois participate federal state scheme cooperative federalism known aid aged blind disabled program at time mater state law illinois would permitted people denied assistance appeal prevailed administrative appeal eventually prevailed judicial review would permitted payment retroactive relief this case however simple action united states congress 1974 repealing former title 16 social security act replacing wholly federally funded authorized supplemental security income program therefore present since 1974 illinois participating federal program so question becomes particular recipient seek administrative review today go state court court consider question whether entitled retroactive relief i think would first deal threshold question whether state still participating federal program today your honor view notice relief closely related actual award benefits position goes we view principles sovereign immunity courts decision edelman limit application doctrine sovereign immunity cases involving actual award monetary relief we believe principles sovereign immunity must include cases require sovereign act affirmatively triggers operation governmental machinery we draw support proposition courts rulings issue federal sovereign immunity suit larson versus domestic  foreign commerce corporation  that correct yes i really complete exposition state procedures if i could back answer justice stevens justice rehnquists questions notice relief trigger governmental machinery intrude upon sovereign state illinois following respects the notice go twenty thousand welfare recipients file request appeals administrative agency the agency hold hearings depending upon conclusion final decisions agency hearings recipients right seek judicial review state courts if state court arrive conclusion retroactive assistance paid members plaintiff class matter state law petitioner director department power request state comptroller draw state treasurer pay assistance warrant relates appropriation lapsed we talking obligations relate appropriations years 1968 1971 under illinois law appropriation members lapsed the director power  that correct next step  that correct so point court claims perhaps even ruling favor members plaintiffs class illinois law mere recommendation general assembly pay pay catch seems federal court issued notice relief stands ready intervene particular point proceedings whether administrative judicial legislative use powers title 28 section 2283 protect effectuate judgments use powers title 28 section 2202 grant relief that correct i think could step proceeding whether administrative judicial voice overlap they keep intruding legitimate state affairs nudging matter closer closer point payment occur even though couldnt said directly federal court actually ordered it everything fact order feel that closely tide actual award monetary relief really amounts subterfuge it said envisioned notice would contain predetermination liability state it whatever notice might send however i think would include right appeal denial benefits period 1968 1971 once trigger fair hearing process everything else follows judicial review court claims legislative matters but assuming federal court would retain power enforce protect notice relief would seem  court merely  court stands ready intrude state law state procedure see desired result eventual monetary award realized maybe another way approaching problem attempt delineate edelman precludes way federal courts remedial power relief this notice stretch imagination perspective it must deemed compensatory it perspective perspective injunctive relief dealt 1971 1972 federal time standards there never question notice relief case that leaves us notice relief designed compensate prelitigation conduct and court said edelman compensatory relief dealing past completed misconduct beyond powers federal court objection eleventh amendment raised the answer would it would i suppose could come  members plaintiff class would able come offices public aid request appeal denial benefits  yes would result federal courts order objection state violation right free suit eleventh amendment well especially litigation prohibition award monetary benefits precluded court feel strongly happening attempting achieve ultimate goal retroactive benefits indirection seventh circuit court appeals aiding abetting indirection feel violation courts decision certainly inconsistently principles sovereign immunity because federal order grant notice relief significant intrusion upon state affairs these hearings would necessity follow judicial review would follow i think matter significantly mr justice stevens would occur result federal court order merely gooder cost expense  there one significant difference at point proceedings way names identities people denied benefits past would able put together disseminate would result federal court order viewed notice relief identity members plaintiff class part prospective relief power require state put together disseminate so dogooder really putting notice  i think notice relief circumstance case form cannot deemed consistent principles federalism embodied eleventh amendment those principles federalism require respect federal sovereigns state sovereigns sovereign free act consistently within sphere operation constitution edelman versus jordan ex parte versus young court attempted make sure reaches proper applications fourteenth amendment well eleventh amendment given full play long one require lessening weakening if believe plaintiff say case notions federalism in effect federal courts able grant relief effectively renders eleventh amendment hollow shell our notion federalism evidenced distinction perspective equitable relief retroactive relief recognized edelman think proper balance court able work edelman distinction retrospective prospective milliken versus bradley case it able find justification wiping ongoing incidences quality detroit school system granting prospective relief contained remedial reading programs the distinction prospective retroactive applied particular case however shows talking relief measured teams past breach legal duty mr chief justices may i please court if specific questions petitioners counsel time i would like reserve balance time rebuttal in response counsel’s comments i’d like return i think two crucial facts particular case decisive issue whether form notice relief appropriate court’s decision edelman eleventh amendment those two facts one plaintiff brought compliant federal court 1971 alleged available administrative remedies paragraphs 27 39 compliant appendix a12 a14 purposefully chose ignore right seek hearing state court six seven years later back court saying entitled notice the second crucial fact  that correct fact plaintiff mr justice marshall mr jordan received retroactive benefits would even seeking the second crucial fact i believe 1974 congress repealed former title 16 social security act any right notice hearing members plaintiff class may 1971 i believe extinguished fact longer rights obligations respect notice binding  well back whether notice whether also  insofar noticeable trigger request hearings hearing judicial review possible action legislative triggering governmental machinery far concerned substantially intrudes upon sovereign violates sovereign’s freedom form suit counsel plaintiff stated state officer seeking protect state block access state remedies i think sufficiently dealt fact longer operating formal title 16 federalism plaintiff’s assert requires balancing competing interest states federal government i think plaintiff trying case confuse notion federalism used cases younger v harris i understand prudential notion federalism federalism inherited every eleventh amendment controversy federalism must take account eleventh amendment renders absolute bar jurisdiction federal court this court said monaco versus mississippi eleventh amendment must given effect far reaches so really question balancing interest ever violation federal law must remedy the point suit essentially state the state free assert eleventh amendment immunity suit thank you,392.0,472,18,we hear arguments next 841 quern jordan mr wenzel may proceed whenever ready how much case think still view majority en banc seventh circuits opinion states appeal reversed judgment district court said district court inclined could enter modest decree mr wenzel matter illinois law would state power authority give retroactive relief period prior april 8 1971 well district court seventh circuit i read opinion left completely state courts determine it doesnt say state courts award retroactive relief it says class people may told may claim state courts remits state courts mr wenzel get far argument i want sure i got entire answer question i put do i correctly summarize saying someone whether got notice receive benefits period prior april 8 1971 file kind claim illinois state system whether administrative judicial dont really know whether state would pay anything right but either result possible far know record law may able point right but isnt like various claims asserted state claim maybe asserted court claims whatever called i forget may established legislation  general assembly wisdom decides whether pay claim so isnt possible twenty thousand people get money gotten could establish sort claim might enough political influence get legislature adopt pass bill saying lets pay money but really wont chance unless initiate claim first instance but court appeals say one thing cant order payment i understand would say district courts order case seventh circuit majority rather substantially modified didnt but virtue state law i would think majority seventh circuit felt way think felt would simply would affirmed judge wills order rather reversed i see could say judge wills order i difficulty interpretation judge woods opinion seventh circuit would objection community organization decided  say win case community organization decides well people lot blind disabled elderly people wrongfully denied money seven eight years ago ten well community organization decides ought know rights send precisely notice would  would different consequence answer really talking pays notice no question gooder organization says well people ought know rights send bulletin words notice court appeals apparently thought appropriate wouldnt produce consequences concerned seriously private association would court appeals en banc but dogooder could say federal decision state illinois wrongfully denied money entitled dogooder could tell fact court appeals notice need necessarily recite ordered court appeals he might able benefit entire class dont know rights would let fall way side protect surface i see we resume 1 oclock counsel luncheon break mr wenzel may resume you eight minutes left i observe very well mr roodman what saying class entitled  well propositions propositions maybe considered maybe accepted state administrative agencies course ie administrative remedy b may congress repealed law longer is matter state courts determine that doesn’t really directly bear eleventh amendment question case maybe notice vain thing may futility doesn’t directly bear eleventh amendment thank gentleman the case submitted,1451.0,1831,10,mr chief justices may i please court the central question presented court today whether eleventh amendment immunity state illinois maybe invoked state official bar order requiring send notices members duly certified class this question arises one aspect three pronged relief granted federal court first declaration federal court director illinois department public aid promulgated administrative regulations contrary social security act therefore void supremacy clause second light declaration federal court enjoined future enforcement administrative regulations these two aspects relief already held court consistent eleventh amendment on remand jordan i must emphasized members plaintiff class wholly dark regarding lawsuit accordingly class representative fulfillment fiduciary obligations class sought order requiring petitioner send notices members class merely explaining one federal suit filed behalf two denied certain aabd benefits three preexisting state administrative procedures challenging denial benefits four method might trigger procedures yes honor b2 class federal  correct federal rules civil procedure therefore notice required federal rules notice sent members class so decision court jordan i ordered notice never received notice dependency case proceeding so notice respondents seek behalf merely advised lawsuit pending it advised declaration court advised preexisting administrative procedures might challenge denial benefits the seventh circuit approved sending notices extent notices way predetermined liability state illinois the notices sent appropriate rule 23d2 federal rules civil procedure also appropriate exercise general equitable discretion court further declaratory judgment act federal courts authority entering declaratory judgment give necessary proper relief notices fall within section well that correct your honor that sole basis argument court today there could cases equitable considerations might compel federal court decline send notices class even finding violation social security act those questions equity eleventh amendment jurisprudence the question raised court today eleventh amendment immunity state illinois we believe close examination principles sovereign immunity federalism embodied eleventh amendment show petitioner seeking use eleventh amendment way never intended contrary purposes eleventh amendment i first discuss eleventh amendment issues turn 1983 issues presented case in jordan i court reaffirmed principle eleventh amendment bars federal court entering awards money damages directly state this interpretation eleventh amendment fell within historical purposes eleventh amendment protect state treasuries federal court orders avoid potential clash federal state sovereigns also prevent direct substantial intrusion upon sovereignty state federal courts question federalism neither historical purposes eleventh amendment however anyway jeopardized sending notices approved seventh circuit en banc the order challenged petitioner result clash federal state sovereigns on contrary order respects institutions state government leaves institutions state government ultimate determination fiscal liability state your honor believe that order well would permissible eleventh amendment that order would displace state determining question fiscal liability accordance state law extent order intrude upon central decisions state government central sovereignty such order would  your honor would necessarily imposing burden question would left state yes honor fact petitioner violated federal rights members plaintiff class central there weighing federal interest case state interest we central finding case violation supremacy clause knowing violation supremacy clause plus federal interests stake case what federal court done accommodated harmonized federal interests state interests it done way intrusive upon state government it leaves state government final determination fiscal matters central state government the direct excuse  yes the original jurisdictional base lawsuit section 1343 your honor original claim based equal protection clause supremacy clause the federal court never reached equal protection clause they relied solely upon social security act supremacy clause your honor would submit fact petitioner state officer seeking protect sovereignty state illinois what seeks block access respondents state created remedies the state sovereign state illinois agreed provide administrative remedies public aid recipients wish challenge denial benefits that requirement part social security act state illinois went even one step they provide judicial review administrative decisions director illinois department public aid so procedures remedies sovereign state adopted members plaintiff class director seeks prevent utilizing we submit basis assuming interests sovereign state illinois aligned interests director illinois department public aid the director illinois department public aid originally violated social security act your honor attorney general represent director illinois department public aid court well  your honor sole person court today i think your honor think  we maintaining honor interests interests sovereign state illinois necessarily aligned the sovereign state legislature adopted explicit remedies respondents case challenge denial benefits the director hand state officer it true cases state officer identical interests sovereign particularly state officer responsible initial violation law we think cases kind state officer seeking block respondents utilizing procedures state legislature expressly adopted your honor i think  no question whether state officer permitted invoke immunity state illinois no honor attorney general representing state officer think permitted invoke immunity state illinois except cases direct substantial intrusion upon state government this court held jordan i money damages state direct intrusion upon state therefore appropriate state officer able invoke immunity state illinois in tax cases 1940s claims money judgments state state officer could claim immunity state however cases cases money damages cases state officer permitted claim immunity state illinois state nation notice relief submit create clash sovereign state illinois national government federal courts instead notice remedy carefully tailored remedy designed avoid clash the remedy sending members class back state institutions avoids clash sovereigns ultimately question whether shall recover benefits denied question state government decide administrative agencies judicial branch money judgments your honor judgments direct monetary impact upon state past conduct this court hold say equitable restitution indistinguishable money damages barred previously money judgments recovery bonds tax cases person sought recover taxes claim illegally exacted in absence money judgment particular notices ordered problems enforcement court concerned cases involving money judgments the enforcement solely state officer if fact plaintiffs recover case state officer contempt federal court the requirement state officer send notices after questions liability reserved state government yes honor well i would assume state courts decide pay state officer would respect judgments state the eleventh amendment would apply state courts your honor our remedy honor would within state court system might pursue remedies contempt within state court system he would violation federal court order would remedy contempt federal court potential clash state sovereign federal sovereign yes honor correct your honor cases involve collection bonds those cases didn’t intended specifically recover principal  payment principal interest bonds they involve money judgment those cases fell within historical purposes eleventh amendment original case chisholm versus georgia suit collection money the question your honor think would turn principles federalism it would extent federal court order intrusive upon state sovereign stand within federal system that think basis  balancing test federal court would apply situation the question throughout though  almost two hundred years eleventh amendment always whether particular relief consistent nation’s federalism and federalism requires sensitivity state interest national interest in case absence relief approved seventh circuit en banc federal court ignoring condoning violation federal rights plaintiff class in federal system violation federal rights cannot go unredressed what lower courts done tailor remedy sensitive federal rights supremacy clause constitution time recognizing interest  legitimate interest state government intruding upon institutions state government by leaving state government ultimate determination liability federal court harmonized interests federal government federal funds stake aabd program federal rights involved social security act course federal interests involved seeing supremacy clause adhered the federal interests case quite different tax cases 1940’s bond cases later part nineteenth century in cases program based upon cooperative federalism there federal interests involved directly cases yes your honor certainly federal interest fourteenth amendment that question could raised presented state court system ultimately considered court and seek case seek issues liability referred back state court system determine within context state law federalism  state court system i certainly would agree your honor the point case finding violation federal law court upheld so freeprong nature relief finding violation federal law whereas tax cases entire matter referred ab initio state court system consideration the petitioner explain notice relief way undermines federalism further petitioner cites cases support position the petitioner seems suggest state real party interest notices burden upon office however important distinguish equitable considerations eleventh amendment considerations if class involved 500 persons question comparison equities case it question court would weigh balance deciding whether send notices eleventh amendment community state turn question number persons class what important  federal courts provide remedy coextensive violation unless federal remedy notices members plaintiff class approved persons actually harmed violation law would seek  would receive redress whatsoever the petitioner argues respondents seeking accomplish indirection jordan wanted barred directly it true court held jordan i members plaintiff class barred recovering what court held federal court could order recovery therefore decision federal court en banc consistent original decision jordan i finally important take account also principles federalism embodied section 1 civil rights act 1871 codified 1983 in enacting provision congress clearly intended provide effective federal remedy infringement federal rights state officers occurred case in congress recognized federal courts would 1 overriding certain state laws 2 providing federal remedy state law inadequate 3 providing federal remedy state remedy though adequate theory available practice precisely situation today a state remedy available theory practice state remedy triggered sending notice unless members plaintiff clause notice would unable utilize procedures thus consistent intent congress 1983 provide sending notices individuals for state officer frustrate intent congress heavy burden the state officer must able show remedy appropriate 1983 direct intrusion upon sovereignty state in absence showing argument 1983 remedy frustrated must fail in conclusion urge court affirm judgment seventh circuit en banc hold eleventh amendment bars order merely requiring state official send notices would inconsistent historical purposes eleventh amendment would inconsistent federalism would inconsistent congressional mandate embodied 1983 yes sir your honor believe would question  because supremacy clause integral part constitution violation social security act fact violation supremacy clause therefore  if wrong question would disturb anyway courts affirmance order seventh circuit excuse mean jurisdictionally yes your honor questions this court fact jordan expressly held 1983 appropriate cause action enforcing social security act we would find jurisdiction  yes your honor dual constitutional language 1983 well laws yes your honor would jurisdiction 1331 this question rising constitution we would claim case excess 10000 if claim cause action violation social security act question also 1331 well would your honor addition declaratory judgment act we would provides cause action would seek equitable relief first declaratory judgment acts state officer contrary federal law supremacy clause pursuant declaration would seek equitable relief enjoin future violations social security act so would remedy adequate law the plaintiff’s would suffering irreparable injury therefore would meet tests equitable jurisdiction normal equitable principles secure injunction acts state officers violation – that correct your honor well jurisdiction federal court clear its already upheld jordan i we clearly properly federal court it conceivable cases pending court houston offer rights well your honor seven years litigation i think appropriate court exercise pendent jurisdiction yes i that correct your honor precisely  yes well declaratory judgment  well 1983 would proper cause action constitutional claim would pendent claim declaratory judgment act general equitable principles denominating solely statutory claim yes – precisely thank you,425.0,537,46,mr roodman class action procedures come play largely since i left private practice is ordinary say members plaintiff class would largely dark remand court edelman decision merits injunctive  you talking affirmative basis district courts authority act your opponents contend whatever affirmative authority might support cases eleventh amendment bars what order provided addition seventh circuit said could provide cant  although illinois law provide hearing situation matter federal constitution law goldberg versus kelly line cases hearing mandated constitution therefore regardless illinois law illinois state system would give hearings certainly would imposing rather substantial aspect retrospect relief would except state would required hold hearing are finished mr justice rehnquist i wondered jurisdictional basis civil matter and claim based federal law who speaks state illinois court well look hear views state illinois im sure i understand prior statement i understood say nothing indicate director speaking sovereign state illinois how resolve potential conflict implying do decide good state illinois thinks can attorney general invoke immunity the original district court decree case didnt speak terms damage it spoke terms equitable restitution suggesting know wasnt quiet airtight award damages so correct saying strictly damages forbidden eleventh amendment now states executive branch pursuant suggestion decides pay then go state courts and state court decides pay happens what attorney general says purposes illustration violates eleventh amendment holdings and thats i posed asserted and conversely state courts hypothetical decide entitlement thats end it mr roodman cases like in re ayers hagood southern cited edelman jordan court refused permit suit federal court specific performance contract i take could well involved monetary damages would allow  would think eleventh amendment allowed district court case order state official specifically perform contract state engaged long involve actual payment money supposedly involve furnishing supplies group people well mr roodman tax cases wasn’t claim ford motor company example tax violated federal constitution would say federal interest well i puzzled statement federal interests magnitude involved tax cases 40s case i would think federal court set vindicate fourteenth amendment quiet much supremacy clause can i pursue previous question moment suppose complaint socalled statutory issue claim conflict equal protection issue would jurisdiction 1543 because if wrong well i didn’t  take example statutory claim complaint yes jury  i ask two questions do think state cause action that claim compliant secondly would jurisdiction federal court under  law part 1983 lets assume 1983 reach laws would jurisdictional problem example yeah cause action would arising social security act yes 1983 reach federal statutes social security act isnt covered 1983 went 1331 attempting state cause action would successfully claim social security act gives private cause action in event jurisdiction issue raised but i suppose permitted raise well maybe properly federal court constitutional issue asserted 1530 1543 the question appended claim did say thought edelman sustained cause action 1983 merely allegation violation federal law namely social security act you also allege constitutional violation compliant would presume argument pendent jurisdiction hagans lavine yes still cause action i mean cause action appended cause action and 1983 doesn’t reach social security act cause action   nothing appended yes would 1983 claim question violation social security act you say i think said jordan i said very well anything mr wenzel,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-28,-1,-163.0,-33.0

federal claims shall jurisdiction claim united states plaintiff pending another court another case government agents respect claim the federal circuit expressly repudiating longsettled precedent held section 1500 automatically requires dismissal whenever plaintiff pending sometime suit another action growing transaction operative facts yes yes thats right required dismissal even actions pursued separately even action based new rule petitioner came cases dismissed 10 years pretrial proceedings completed denying keene hearing claims based governments sale asbestos requirement asbestos products purchased manner operating shipyards our position federal circuit misconstrued section 1500 two respects two longstanding constructions 1500 reinstated first two suits respect claim congress insisted claims two suits different demanding must brought separately second plain terms statute apply plaintiff longer pending suit now first position i want make four points the first settled law court claims federal circuit two courts aside court could ever address question quarter century congress declared two separate rights action must litigated two different courts court turn around read 1500 saying two suits really respect claim no i think well stare decisis strict terms perhaps applies courts review precedent nevertheless stare decisis policybased doctrine no i think thats right i think presents two unique circumstances one issue 1500s interpretation unique federal circuit there cant lower court conflict consequence reliants interest litigants like keene congress legislating area must necessarily look established law circuit guide litigants guide congress reason think cases like casman line cases demand special respect yes i think thats right the principle thats right the reading court claims federal circuit gave statute quarter century fact think reflects natural reading 1500s language yes version argument in 1982 congress took broad look whole set statutes governing court claims transformed court trial court claims court federal circuit reenacted 1500 merely changing name court applied by time statute consistently construed ways suggest think appropriate inference construed otherwise quite draconian consequences would fact led congress take second look the fact construed deprive litigants rights i think best explanation real issue made 1500 reenacted 1982 it make number substantive amendments looking entire range statutes it added certain limited jurisdiction claims court provide certain kinds equitable relief couldnt provided it provided special transfer statute ensure precisely kind loss rights filing wrong court issue also made number substantive amendments governed aspects used court claims also court customs yes thats right it general review 1982 statutory regime governing suits united states particular court claims when statute asks second suit respect claim first suit naturally understood think targeting repetitive litigation situations two suits brought really one situation there repetition two suits brought different legal rights congress said must litigated separately this exactly rule claim preclusion law think obvious place turn defining two suits treated respect claim what 1500 apply judgment reached claim preclusion law kicks judgment first suit what 1500 say plaintiff cannot proceed two different forums time judgment claim preclusion would say nothing it protects government problem so 1500 performs role addition claim preclusion law never i think would let say first i think would mistake event whatever 1868 legislative history concerning cotton claim said carry forward new statute new legal landscape control interpretation but even terms thing one tell 1868 history congress wanted relax one condition claim preclusion law condition mutuality parties nothing 1868 history suggested two claims aside mutuality parties would otherwise would within statute the cotton claims would best view discover 19th century res judicata law fact defendant one tests establishing sameness claims socalled evidence rule if evidence one case would enough support claim case evidence would suffice claims would treated common law conversion claim would test statutory conversion claim added simply element loyalty evidence proved loyalty conversion would lesser included offense prove conversion i think take time account like body precedent certain point earlier decisions reinterpreted perhaps even altered the earlier interpretation 1500 predecessor court claims took broader view what happened 1956 casman case court recognized congress insisted claims brought two different forums treated i think within year but shortly became established rule repeated court claims litigant forced two separate suits treated i certainly dont know single instance i dont think government cited one litigant thrown 1500 los angeles shipyard may simply fully appreciated casman but event since early sixties 30 years i dont think theres single case rule failed applied litigant lost rights virtue bringing two separate suits claims congress said brought two separate suits it first moved away rule predecessor case johnsmanville case clarified really meant the ca fed i think boston five cents savings bank case i recall right that i dont remember exactly in mideighties i think 1988 1988 yes the court claims casman decision cited and specifically applied 1976 allied materials case circumstances even money damages sought two different claims type relief condition distinguishing claims in 19th century answer probably there always difference evidence would tort contract claims different legal elements in 19th century evidence test probably wouldnt applied hand would real need well mutuality 19th century res judicata insisted something much closer legal theory opposed transaction base best now let say reading longestablished reading 1500 statute performs two limited sensible functions fact functions justice department last year opposed repeal 1500 told congress performed the justice department say provision applied sequencing merely related claims it said one function bar forum shopping cases within concurrent jurisdiction court federal claims district court a plaintiff includes tax refund cases little tucker act cases perhaps others the plaintiff cant test two forums time judgment see judge going look favorably upon claim yes 10000 contract claims constitutional claims et cetera the second function preclude simultaneous suits concurrent jurisdiction plaintiff filed case two different forums statute simply bars plaintiff proceeding court federal claims district courts lack jurisdiction established sometimes requires years litigation and functions obviously modest i say justice department explained 1500 kept opposed repeal congress reference functions much draconian function suggests today sequencing merely related suits it the final reason support first position precisely draconian consequences federal circuits new version the fact like keene many litigants seeking redress government must file separate cases whether tort contract claims many amici case point statutory challenge government action also taking challenge the regular unavoidable effect governments position requiring sequencing suits loss many litigants tucker act claims either sheer delay postponing adjudication perhaps years case would 7 8 years even worse expiration statutes limitations equitable tolling unavailable let turn well two cases court claims consolidated one involving contract claims one involving takings claims in courts omnibus tort claim yes the initial omnibus ftca action brought southern district new york after thrown action tried district columbia essentially exactly complaint essentially administrative notice requirement ftca imposes specificity requirement court found keene could meet underlying tens thousands claims government yes filing new series administrative notices subsequently also found jurisdictionally inadequate yes yes thats right one suit i unsuccessfully thats right keene never hearing tort claims jurisdictional problem ruling contract claims the one suit i didnt mention briefly one suits brought keene thirdparty action impleading united states voluntarily dismissed order proceed issue suits the second point second position section 1500 regardless scope claim language application suit another court thats whatever court 1500 raised another case pending again i three i think simple points first terms statute applies plaintiff court federal claims pending another suit it simply come play let alone require dismissal suit pending second even governments version policy 1500 protection simultaneous dual related litigation application dual litigation after suit outside court federal claims simply dual litigation sort protect justice oconnor i think two separate questions address one whether time another suit pending jurisdiction label automatically requires dismissal no issue raised the issue issue happens earlier proceeding jurisdictional defect longer present courts decision newmangreen establishes established even even pure jurisdictional provision existence earlier jurisdictional defect mean case shouldnt go forward in fact court said case go forward defect cured thats exactly even assumption 1500s jurisdiction language read making pure jurisdictional provision we situation even assumption jurisdictional defect earlier litigation time question dismissal arose longer jurisdictional defect newmangreen think perfectly appropriate indeed would unfair yes thats right by time well im saying practical matter issue brought anybodys attention 8 years litigation right newmangreen parties raised outset litigation fact nondiverse party defect cured course dismissal would required what court said newmangreen confirming many lower courts views even though jurisdiction nondiverse party day suit filed years litigation defect cured case go forward justice scalia i dont know example either way question ive looking situations question jurisdictional defect existed earlier proceeding coming end presented i dont know situation except newmangreen one i think rationale properly extend situations including one certain measure practicality necessary jurisdictional defect theres reason dismiss suit well that traditional rule measuring time diversity must arise right i think newmangreen confirmed longstanding recognition lower courts jurisdictional defect even required dismissal present necessarily require dismissal defect yes yes thats right except for statute limitations question open one although claims court recently addressed favorably question open one whether equitable tolling would available the claims court decision came couple weeks ago held exactly circumstances equitable tolling would available we might we might although i must say would take doubt several years litigation issue go back federal circuit decide whether claims court trial court correct particular decision we i mean i think help i dont want place much weight it suggest 1500 appearing amidst numerous provisions talk jurisdiction enter judgment properly interpreted focus presence jurisdictional defect time judgment entered judgment entry judgment often described single distinguishing characteristic makes court court opposed anything else well one thing authority outset 1948 section 1500 didnt use word jurisdiction it provision happen filing prosecution claim i think language helps us considerably one would ordinarily think rule like automatically carry rigid dismissal result matter remedy there would still open question remedy violation filing rule flexibility remedy fact court claims regularly applied starting 1960s time time merely require stay case suspension case rule says two things 1 issue case goes forward defect longer present the thing says present even time defect present dismissal required mere suspension i note pennsylvania railroad case exactly court it reversed court claims dismissal case ordered court claims merely suspend proceeding another case district court proceeding yes thats right no i dont think i think right i think that language make clear impropriety original filing prosecution two questions would remain one merely suspending case mean still prosecuted litigation burdens imposed government question would remedy filing violation as i think case would still proper mere suspension would required yes if filing took place time statutory condition met statute violated time let refer finally arguments briefs nonretroactivity equitable tolling event court adopts federal circuits interpretation rest fundamental unfairness overruling settled law decade litigation depriving keene day court claims government if court questions ill reserve balance time thank mr chief justice i want make two points one reliance interests one effect federal circuits interpretation the first keene certainly relied clear rule whatever type relief separately filing tort contract actions so government the government 1980 initially made motion 1500 tactical reasons according attorney withdrew motion the second point stay takes care government interest avoiding securing benefits collateral estoppel cant claim government way becoming aware suits even internal mechanisms dont provide awareness need filing action submit interrogatory ask actions proceeding so concerns multiple overlapping litigation merely litigation exactly claim overlapping related litigation might involve certain similar issues simply justifies federal let make two points first pending question thats separate line authority absolutely clear without kind dispute suit court claims action proceeds we win case exception without regard scope claim as scope claim casman enunciated principle said different types relief sought theyre claim cases brought different forums it extended principle natural scope whenever two different claims brought different forums i dont know single case restricted claims involving different types relief,440.0,625,27,well hear argument 92166 keene corporation v the united states mr taranto when say repudiating longstanding precedent mr taranto mean federal circuit court claims precedent right on general principle law base argument mr taranto i mean dont ordinarily review court claims federal circuit precedent we wouldnt take case i dont think hear argued ninth circuit failed follow stare decisis connection ninth circuit precedent but i would still say even hadnt precedent one court appeals wrong and since would court construe statute couldnt wait conflict are position make argument congress might deemed accepted interpretation was reenactment amendment might picked accepted theory given peculiarities claims fed circuit jurisdiction congress might deemed accept well congress overhaul statutes governing court claims federal circuit 1982 necessary create new court amendments say werent occasioned creation new court but wouldnt need special statute would congress wanted application claim preclusion law that would apply without statute certainly courts throughout country apply without special statute but would interpretation youve explained satisfied congressional concern cotton litigation prompted statute but mr taranto seems possible precedent court claims decisions quite uniform suggest the british american tobacco case i think court claims held word claim refers fact facts existing operating cases theres similar holding los angeles shipbuilding drydock case id like explain whether precedent really uniform suggest but los angeles shipbuilding decided casman yes well ca fed recognized rule theyre talking well ever accept when decided but time ca fed created say law court claims pretty clear mr taranto civil version evidence rule referring moment ago would two suits simply based least community fact one sounding tort one sounding contract precluded simultaneous suits because mutuality little tucker act district court 10000 whatever and ca feds change theory how many different cases client pending connection asbestos litigation when say courts would specific why thrown district court new york did effect try relitigate district columbia so went back tried cure basically defect district court new york found and unsuccessfully but i suppose 1500 couched jurisdictional statute normally would think means court federal claims jurisdiction you say time arose does mean saying time government made motion why wouldnt arise beginning second lawsuit but jurisdictional matter ordinarily wouldnt make difference thats something government waive mr taranto i thought newmangreen sort dodo bird least exception i thought normal rule otherwise dont jurisdiction outset cant patch later do know situation newmangreen weve allowed absence jurisdiction jurisdiction exist outset case remedied later do think im citizen diverse state later move diverse state suit becomes retroactively validated a diversity suit i mean yes i thats im saying i always assumed traditional rule looked outset litigation newmangreen noteworthy exception well mr taranto theres suit pending another court file suit court claims court claims dismisses even though time dismissal suit dismissed case isnt suppose dismisses can file another suit court claims i would think could except statute limitations you say court claims so lose suit affirm ca fed might able sue court claims mr taranto tucker act rather unusual formulation it says court claims shall jurisdiction enter judgment case rather shall jurisdiction case does anything turn it seem help speaks toward jurisdiction end case little odd talk jurisdiction end case but explain authority outset mr taranto wasnt original language i cant find briefs wasnt bring prosecute and doesnt cut interpretation youre giving i mean changed without indication change meant substantive one all youd say though statute violated point youd say bygones bygones it violated brought longer brought prosecuted thats okay very well mr taranto mr wallace well hear mr taranto would comment i understand mr wallaces argument really dont come within exception particular exception makes strongest case saying congress said sue two different forums seeking purely equitable relief another forum damages forum thank mr taranto the case submitted,1418.0,1418,12,thank mr chief justice may please court the text section 1500 speaks language subject matter jurisdiction it unmistakably excludes certain category cases subject matter jurisdiction court federal claims that courts sole function hear claims united states monetary awards occasionally certain ancillary relief these claims sovereign waivers sovereign immunity strictly construed express exclusion waiver sovereign immunity congress enacted fairly construed accomplish purpose restricting waiver sovereign immunity so much argument made behalf petitioner case claims congress authorized might foreclosed provision overlooks fact provision exclusion waiver sovereign immunity extent provision applies claims authorized united states from beginning 1868 predecessor statute enacted central purpose clear prevent simultaneous litigation related claims the cotton claimants unable bring two categories claims congress focused court thats common sense petitioner theorized whether could brought whether claimants could brought cases court claims federal officers could brought united states possibility time the federal tort claims act enacted 1946 so beginning recognized paradigm class cases statute designed apply cases related claims brought two different courts purpose statute well certainly practical reason cases brought outside washington brought washington could court claims would jurisdiction suits officers in days officers sued individual capacity committed tort supposedly conducting official duties exactly they would brought district court rather court claims outset recognized applied force claimants choose two different claims related claims that correct mr justice well sued basic set facts judgment thats correct it would paid someone different at least purposes paying judgments thats quite correct mr chief justice the one significant change made statute made carry function forward enactment federal tort claims act 1946 suits tort claims formally made officers could made united states 1948 addition judicial code revisers redrafted added suits united states court original language referred suits officers court substance carried forward in fact revisers note said nothing change phraseology substance precluding putting government simultaneous defense tort suit district court claim court claims carried forward the plaintiff could force choice upon government now rehearing petition government filed case federal circuit i think government articulated two important telling points i believe led court federal circuit reexamine series precedents matter the first point i want recount court purpose rule rule applied situation keene presented court government put rehearing petition rule propounded panel whereby claimant dismissed district court case court federal claims ruled motion dismiss would right two suits go forward simultaneously one alternative grounds proposed petitioner today what said rehearing petition rule propounded panel would permit claimant tie government resources two courts simultaneously indefinite period time claimant continues assess relative chances recovery one forum as long claimant bails district court claims court actually rules section 1500 motion claimant plaintiffs precisely congress intended preclude now particular case suit initially pending district court thirdparty complaint united states involving one asbestos claims aware even though suit later brought court federal claims government omnibus suit involving many similar claims aware modern rules collateral estoppel would allow individual suit sort used stalking horse looked suit would succeed could go forward used possible collateral estoppel effect government courts decision united states stauffer chemical company that could happen courts aware once awareness well government always aware overlap claims promptly know even though may remedies government could turn certainly arguments put congress continue put congress whether section 1500 repealed revised fact congress proposed remedy barring initially said plaintiff filing prosecuting court claims says court claims shall jurisdiction suit pending related claim court well that possibility raised briefs amicus curiae we thus far attempted it would depend particular situation case whether would come within federal circuits rules collateral attacks within 2 years judgment but rules repose federal circuits rules kind challenge raised within 2 years judgment understanding i cant say ive focused detail question i think i could mr justice that remains determination future litigation well second point rehearing petition rule adopted panel focusing time motion ruled logically inconsistent one exceptions old court claims developed section 1500 socalled tecon exception focused exclusively time filing complaints said long complaint filed first claims court filed district court right cases go ahead simultaneously its another suit already pending district court claim filed old court claims 1500 would applied point logical inconsistency two doctrines could say either consistent language purpose section 1500 therefore agreed dissenting opinion judge mayer panel court might well advised review precedents 1500 altogether strayed far language purpose statute that correct your honor it exclusion jurisdiction court federal claims terms it provides exception jurisdiction court federal claims otherwise would related claims pending well possibly that correct that position ruling court federal claims case held keenes suit barred come within established exceptions it arises common nucleus operative effect even though particle nucleus that particular one among hundreds brought court federal claims its common legal issue parties also common issue respect facts break away individual ones courts youre situation government could subjected collateral estoppel effect thats exactly happened stauffer chemical case company first sued quash warrant inspect facility wyoming prevailed 10th circuit government attempted enforce similar warrant private contractors enforce facility company tennessee court held company parties company entitled collateral estoppel benefit judgment so fact coextensive claim initially really doesnt change of course because claim respect its statute says court federal claims shall jurisdiction claim respect plaintiff pending court suit process it respect worry defending it could used us claim court federal claims bar jurisdictional bar now happens case shortly filing initial suit court federal claims petitioners filed omnibus tort action new york extent court federal circuit correct repudiating tecon rule issue would wash case event well true im using collateral estoppel point show respect claim thats pending court federal claims even though one particle nucleus operative fact in omnibus suit well expressed case im aware this case unusual factually because two claims individuals particular claim government brought two courts one case individual claim omnibus bringing together hundreds claims including one facts happen arise case peculiar i think significant petitioner concern complains court appeals reexamined precedents existed precedents court chief justice rightly pointed precedents old court claims claims court that correct believe properly applied keenes case begin that ruling court federal claims case that also understanding precedents federal circuit expressed johnsmanville case preceded one petitioner takes generous think unwarrantedly generous view one line exceptions called casman exception generally understood apply kind relief sought court court federal claims different nature monetary award well i think it could affirmed judgment court federal claims narrower grounds that court used keene parties federal circuit pursue cases court arguing broadening established exceptions i think within proper functioning federal circuit consider whether broadening exceptions exceptions sound begin hardly new question if i may refer court leading article subject still leading article subject published georgetown law journal cited briefs sides back march 1967 shortly major three lines exceptions established author editors georgetown law review summarized authors thesis follows court indulge moment final sentence summary telling purposes im speaking article david schwartz cited no i think shows problems exceptions wellknown judges practitioners caused considerable disuse statute i may quote editors summary after careful discussion historical background judicial construction section 1500 mr schwartz concludes statute longer serves purposes enacted  he argues tortured constructions made statute efforts reach equitable results spite wording resulted confusion longer possible practitioner ascertain statute means  in light developments mr schwartz urges repeal section substitution rule res judicata  that rather close principal submission made petitioner court although obviously author article least thought would require repeal statute reach result advocated court issue considered recent 1992 hearings senator heflins bill repeal statute adopted committee there advocacy repeal well statement opposing repeal department justice colleague adverted not repeal provision all got committee changing language reflect new name court federal claims i keep now also significant several briefs amicus curiae nominally supporting petitioner case say relatively little petitioner prevail chief point court federal federal circuit needlessly reached question whether casman exception repudiated case within casman exception and view federal circuit johnsmanville case well amici concerned repudiation casman exception they understand casman exception cut broadly petitioner claims cut they understood way federal circuit understood apply different form relief sought injunctive relief example district court monetary damages sought court federal claims essentially monetary award sought courts i want say word equitable tolling think would appropriate case petitioner notice statute deliberately decided pursue monetary claims three different district courts well court federal claims well thats right they cite basically point brief one aberrational order federal circuit support broader view casman exception really meant litigate two separate courts right litigate suits situation cotton claimants understanding federal circuits understanding understanding various amici scope casman exception my time expired,324.0,520,10,well mr wallace say related brought two different courts wasnt reason cotton claimants sued officials away washington much congress said couldnt sue court claims venue requirements going sue local official converted cotton would sue official found so say even hadnt venue problem would jurisdictional problem let sure i understand i want sure i understand brought different suits if recovery going take form recovery officer individually would brought district court amount money recovered would either event would so question really formal procedural difference two suits theyre really sued basic set facts and would gotten precisely relief terms dollars least the judgment would read differently one case would read individual the united states wouldnt depended could gotten judgment i suppose insolvent official wouldnt gotten money result whereas get judgment government hopefully insolvent laughter well course theory would tie government resources two suits doesnt hold water particularly your latter point collateral estoppel i would suppose two suits going two different courts roughly set facts one courts going stay let court go forward so one suit quiescent one wont i would assume government would want stay one if view prevails may government collaterally attack final judgments court claims based new theory well i take judgment lacks subject matter jurisdiction void issue least litigated raised parties open to attack you certainly negate possibility i take have got second reason gave federal circuit section 1500 mr wallace doesnt affect claims pending court court claims in words one could pending several actions different district courts throughout country would way affected section 1500 mr wallace time keene 1 filed suit pending single action said counterclaim said could crossclaim said could used stalking horse right that involved one that involved one single action right now would precluded suit claims court 999 9999 actions well doesnt involve cause action even remotely its totally different cause action common nucleus i dont feel arises common nucleus operative fact the government one thing one contract happened thing totally different contract why well seems common legal issue i dont see within language statute collateral estoppel goes issue issue you lot issues involved single claim i dont see fact youd collaterally estopped certain issues one claim necessarily means purposes statute claim you say involves issue thats involved suit involves issue involved claim would collateral estoppel claim mr wallace im little puzzled collateral estoppel argument seems would cut ways might prevail suit get benefit also i thought justification statute something beyond collateral estoppel it burden defending multiple cases whether collateral estoppel would sufficient protection burden simultaneous litigation is i understand youre theory words respect mean expressed cases it seems rather strange use language candidly even though i understand point youre making i see no precedents i suppose they nationwide effect precedents business community might reasonably rely long period time what youre arguing may prevail even rule advocate also suggests maybe federal circuit didnt go far defeat particular claim this greater authority court claims decisions i guess laughter did ever get committee well say notice statute also say notice interpretation court claims given statute say would brought within exceptions

children siblings live together shall treated single household food stamp entitlement purposes this case governments direct appeal united states district court southern district texas the district court ruled section 3i violates equal protection principles discriminating families impermissibly burdening family decisions live together after briefly describing food stamp program facts case i explain district courts decision reversed the food stamp act establishes social welfare program funded department agriculture administered state agencies it supplements food purchasing power low income households under program state agencies distribute food stamps needy households basis standard allotments take account household size the food stamp program grown rapidly since creation 1964 it nations second costly needsbased public assistance program in 1983 program outlays 11 billion providing assistance 21 million program participants the huge cost dramatic growth food stamp program produced public concern reports widespread waste fraud in 1981 1982 congress amended food stamp act improve program efficiency curtail certain types frequently encountered recipient abuse congress gave particular attention food stamp acts definition term household prior 1981 persons lived together purchased prepared meals separately could claim separate household status thereby receive higher per capita benefits as result families frequently mischaracterized members separate households obtain additional food stamps congress response amended household definition provide parents children siblings live together shall treated one household food stamp entitlement purposes regardless actual meal purchase preparation habits congress also provided special exception permitting elderly disabled parents siblings qualify separate household fact separately prepare meals these amendments household definition specifically designed assure nations limited welfare resources efficiently distributed greatest need appellee natividad castillo family challenged constitutionality revised household definition they claimed new definition violated equal protection principles denying certain family members opportunity claim separate household status the district court consolidated action three suits raising similar equal protection claims the district court ultimately held household definition unconstitutional enjoined application appellees the court acknowledged section 3is treatment family members rational basis therefore meets generally applicable equal protection requirements the court concluded however familybased classifications subject heightened scrutiny it held without analysis section 3i violated appellees fifth amendment rights it clear record clear regulations regulations provide instance eightmember household would receive 75 percent benefits would given eight separate households two fourmember households receive 110 percent benefits eightmember household we submit district court erred concluding section 3i violates equal protection principles instead section 3is household definition represents rational legislative intent improve efficiency food stamp program adopting standards general matter direct nations limited welfare resources greatest need we note first district court agreed section 3is household definition meets rational basis test congress enacted revised household definition response serious public concern size effectiveness integrity food stamp program the 1981 1982 congressional hearings revealed 11 20 percent food stamp benefits issued error amounting program loss 1 2 billion per year those hearings also revealed practice family members falsely claiming separate household status one serious forms abuse finally hearings revealed light large number families participate food stamp program effective efficient means verifying family household status congress therefore elected redefine term household workable solution serious costly problem the refined definition represents rational congressional judgment based thorough investigation deliberation food stamp abuses reduced benefits preserved need treating family members live together single household furthermore definition carefully tailored provide special relief elderly disabled parents siblings family members congress determined need special treatment in short section 3is revised household definition represents type reasonable classification routinely employed social welfare programs the revised definition plainly withstands rational basis scrutiny type scrutiny court applies types classifications indeed district court well courts considered issue agree household definition meets rational basis test the district court went astray applying heightened scrutiny food stamp acts household definition plainly family members class affected household definition represent suspect quasisuspect class furthermore household definition result constitutionally significant limitation individual choice family matters heightened scrutiny applied laws affecting familybased decision governments action directly substantially interferes important family choices here household definition prevent group persons related unrelated living together live together dining apart it simply allocates food stamp benefits families light cooperative arrangements families generally employ the revised definition may provide financial incentive closely related family members live together purchase prepare meals together well neither compels prohibits familybased decision family members retain full range choice structuring living meal preparation habits they designed prevent fraud also improve program efficiency i think clear families better situation fact falsely claim separate household status also seems family members likely purchase prepare meals together in terms actual intent family members likely create fraud i dont think really draw inference i think true best situation fact conduct fraudulent activities it also true family members largest component food stamp program they represent almost threequarters food stamp participants therefore eliminating potential abuse family members significantly reduced potential possibility fraud program i think thats true your honor the problem but would difficult would rather intrusive well if test depends whether family members fact dining together readily available method fact prove whether dining together dining separately it also true difficult cases yes also limited number cases it also seems likely yes might growing number well might congress eventually determine fact one able claim separate household status live together congress considered possibility that suggested various federal state food stamp administrators but congress present content retain special exception elderly disabled persons also unrelated persons the household definitions impact family living arrangements different broad variety legislative provisions consider family status allocating public burdens benefits in sum revised definition term household represents permissible classification designed promote efficiency preserve integrity food stamp program appellees defend district courts decision two additional grounds relied upon district court appellees first contend household definition creates unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption that contention mistaken the household definition creates legitimate legislative classification like upheld weinberger versus salfi as salfi provides distribution benefits based objective criteria congress determined relevant legitimate welfare policy roles appellees also contend food stamp recipients special right increased benefits importance health diet this contention raised also mistaken appellees inherent fundamental right federal food purchasing assistance congress may impose limitations food stamp benefits forms social welfare benefits promote efficiency prevent abuse at bottom appellees urge court declare food stamp act household definition unconstitutional public policy grounds however court repeatedly stated judgement congress questions social welfare policy entitled special deference courts sit pass policy wisdom course congress chosen in case congress determined refined definition household necessary reduce serious fraud food stamp program preserve nations limited benefits greatest need we submit judgment congress quintessential legislative question respected therefore urge court reverse decision if questions i would like reserve remainder time just minutes mr chief justice may please court the regrettable problem governments resources welfare limited order provide maximum use limited resources certain broad categories general characteristics must used order distribute social welfare benefits simply effective expend limited resources case case determinations fact resources directed persons need that might right your honor however much smaller portion total number food stamp recipients program therefore congress fact is directing limited resources areas greatest possible need special exceptions fact congresss thinking fact preserving separate household status unrelated persons elderly disabled yes sir yes your honor food stamps available programs that correct also supplemental social security i certain regulations i believe might sources income might treated income food stamp program yes thats right your honor in fact subject 1981 hearing one things gac pointed fact larger family groups families often receive aid number food aid number different sources including school lunch program also breakfast program provided number schools result fact food stamp families receive aid average family spent food purchases now i think probably exceptional case nevertheless one concerns went congresss determination amending household definition yes that generally true to slightly accurate since 1978 regulations provided husbands wives fact would treated single household that regulatory provision force almost ten years in addition definition spouse provided persons unrelated living together hold spouse even though married fact would treated single household they would eligible sure they would eligible fact apply food stamps basis the regulations provide three types documentation matters first documentary evidence might fact indicate two persons worked different shifts they provide work schedules food stamp office yes yes your honor there periodic rechecking qualifications make sure people continue apply i sure done monthly quarterly basis yes your honor well government interest whether live together it simply question food stamps allocated make decision well yes your honor well your honor no your honor this similar califano v jobst case fact indirect burden family living arrangements in califano v jobst,197.0,281,17,we hear arguments next lyng castillo mr minear i think may proceed whenever ready is anything record mr minear shows difference cost two programs well mr minear amendments principal purpose prevent fraud as far designed prevent fraud rational assume families likely defraud government unrelated individuals that carries suggestion would impossible prove fraud collusion that certainly wouldnt true cases i dont suppose how unrelated people but certainly take cases but growing number very well ms martinez what unrelated families you would saving lot money didnt case case mr minear aid based indigent children aid dependent children are food stamps also given families receive sort aid what program respect disabled persons if add three together gave family would come limit i suppose but greater number children greater number disabled people course greater aid is correct may i ask another question get straight mind if say married couple live together qualify income basis presumably fact definitely held one household yet get amount whereas two unrelated persons lived together came filed appropriate applications made representation one worked night shift day shift purchased food prepared separately would get somewhat larger benefit say come say dont happen live facility work different hours forth so would qualify unrelated persons say sex make simple say sex and apply granted initial kind followup find well maybe hours changed decided could eat time you say qualify initially i asking happens say 30 days later is periodic followup sure and done unrelated persons i think i missed first point what interest government deciding whether people live together doesnt depend whether live together and interest federal government whether people live together does federal government right say must get rid children well going next,1148.0,1206,1,chief justice burger may please court 7 usc 2012 family unconstitutional seven usc 2012i family rule unconstitutionally interferes appellees family choices family choices living together not interfere right live together the harm caused appellees outweighs states interests the district court found family rule food stamp family rule put families distinct disadvantage unrelated individuals could obtain separate household status simply purchasing preparing food separately families matter could never go show impossible prepare food together show could possibly function single economic unit the exception elderly disabled parents siblings the appellees eight families eight guest families eight host families live together there 30 children involved families all appellees children young children support all one maintained separate household economic necessity forced move relatives there question eligible food stamps separate household family natividad castillo wife eight children migrant workers they went north michigan work seasonal labor when returned home income assets one old car they move mrs castillos daughter previous marriage theresa barrera receiving food stamps she two children receiving welfare the food stamp office denied castillo familys application food stamps not deny application food stamps refused supplement mrs barreras food stamp allotment first month castillo family would left without food stamps first month after would received reduced amount based households income case theresa barreras welfare income even though ms barreras income available castillos a similar thing happened cody family also migrant workers also went michigan went home income they unemployed they two young children they moved robert codys mother she five children support veterans administration check receiving food stamps robert jerry codys food stamp application denied food stamp office refused supplement roberts mothers allotment robert jerry two children two young children could food stamps first month three appellees families headed women little lucky they received aid families dependent children separated husbands moved relatives two moved parents they lived separately they maintained separate home time due family rule could receive food stamps separately even though purchased prepared separately even though host familys income available one appellees families cecilia villafranca moved brother she receiving food stamps due family rule would received anything brothers income families deemed one household two families headed men elias ruiz wife two children moved eliass mother son they didnt need help place live mr ruiz became unemployed wife became ill work hospitalized they applied food stamps could get family rules gregorio alvarado wife three young children moved gregorios sister brotherinlaw children gregorio unemployed his wife also ill work they couldnt get food stamps separate household and finally sylvia nieto one maintained separate household sylvia nieto adult woman child support she disabled received supplemental security income benefits the benefits used support son she receiving food stamps separate household family rule came effect the family rule whereas might reasonable believe families likely purchase prepare food together reasonable believe families would commit fraud would like could obtain separate household status that is one reasons family rule irrational when people like appellees people place go money children support show relatives home relative slightly better place live may much better may also welfare theresa barrera hard choice make do allow relatives deprive spouse children even someone better think and allow find cannot support either partially completely relatives decide whether deprive family relatives stay that would hard choice anyone lot harder somebody barely existing somebody welfare and guest families guest family one course suffer they control situation they children support if host relatives allow guest family mercy if host family refuses guest place stay if host family refuses apply food stamps guest family cannot obtain food stamps and isnt unlikely someone would refuse apply food stamps disclosures employment wages resources life insurance death insurance burial insurance everything required reported food stamp eligibility information routinely verified food stamp office employees neighbors anyone knows circumstances applicants used verify information the food stamp office also uses announced home visits determine information correct if family slightly better car worth 6001 aggregation resources would make ineligible food stamps even family owed 5900 car fair market value car used a first family vehicle receive 4500 exemption it would still make ineligible food stamps the joining resources two cars would cause people ineligible food stamps also a car places like rural texas necessity it luxury it could considered luxury would city farm workers need cars get fields places like harlingen texas robert cody lives mass public transportation you need car work the government justifies family rule necessary prevent fraud abuse it justification used unrelated persons provision united states department agriculture versus moreno in case government said congress reasonably believed unrelated persons likely commit fraud could obtain household status could obtain food stamps could participate food stamp program administratively inefficient food stamp agency determine unrelated people committing fraud they argued college students live together voluntarily poor they didnt report income received outside extremely difficult maybe impossible determination fraud made the court found moreno unrelated persons provision served exclude intent likely abuse food stamp program destitute could alter living conditions could retain eligibility food stamps the thing happens the family rule causes people place go become ineligible food stamps receive reduced amount amount based resources and alternatives alternative provisions made conceded problem fraud families burden could placed family show could function single economic unit could purchase prepare food together problems like health problems contagious diseases could purchase prepare food together things determined initial application initial food stamp interview differential work schedules presently food stamp application initial interview questions person works employer hours worked verification made from could find differential work schedules make impossible people purchase prepare food together inadequate kitchen facilities inadequacies poor family kitchen cannot purchase prepare together that determination made questions and isnt unlikely poor family inadequate kitchen stove two burners instead considered usual stove four burners oven that refrigeration that small table table two chairs two chairs these people cannot purchase prepare certainly cannot prepare food together yes i believe at least family given opportunity purchase prepare food together it record unrelated families generally take statement unrelated person and generally end that right the harm done children the majority food stamp recipients families children children case would suffer hunger in plyler versus doe court looked hard cost children saying repeating education fundamental right alien status suspect classification the court looked harm done children the denial education caused hardship states interest conserving money states interest keeping legal immigrants outweigh harm done children yes court said education mere welfare benefit but food stamps reality lot people dont get food stamps dont get food you dont eat food stamps crucial life food stamps necessity other welfare benefits may able without without food wont able without the children case deprived deprived necessary food years development minds bodies end worst situation harmed lot children plyler the children plyler perhaps could receive remedial education children case harmed lack food malnutrition stunting growth mental physical become permanently disabled they may never able may educationally disabled they become burden society economically dependent rest life this regulation limitation substantial deprivation food substantial although families prohibited living together effect rule cause live together once host family finds cannot eat guest comes effect cannot live together for reasons appellees ask court affirm district courts decision if questions i nothing else say well your honor i simply cant answer question if questions,64.0,92,6,would raise voice little we difficulty hearing perhaps lower lectern little bit ms martinez could i ask one question do think statute would constitutional established presumption related families purchase prepare food together unrelated families would burden particular family show regular basis acted contrary presumption how agency follow determining say initial interview describe living arrangements take face value how normally checked later see example unrelated family really separate and end inquiry and course related family situation wouldnt followup rules presumed always share food together do anything

may please court these consolidated cases present two issues there initial jurisdictional issue issue raised regard second two cases standing democratic party jurisdiction section 9011b act jurisdiction bring i consider that issue covered thoroughly arguments sides brief brief filed democratic party intend address point unless questions court we consider read statute seems us though jurisdiction fec raise issues question statutory construction congress intend private parties suing issue so think two severable with regard central question posed case would say power congress limit aggregations expenditures wealth political committees organizations whose purpose influence outcome federal elections where presidential candidates agreed accept public funds lieu private financings campaigns would say limitation constitution particularly first amendment power congress limit expenditures done this case arose appellees two political committees asked commission light courts decision 1981 term common cause versus schmitt court affirmed decision court district columbia four four vote appellees asked commission advisory opinion they asked advisory opinion effect that decision made expenditures excess limitations 9012f permitted statute the commission answered advisory opinion think courts decision case dispositive constitutional issues reaffirmed advisory opinion earlier opinion congress 9012f banned expenditures political committees amounts greater 1000 presidential candidates accepted public financing there really two reasons see statute violate first amendment first congress found great necessity protect integrity government public perception integrity public confidence government corrosive effects public financing and well documented congress private financing excuse i thought made freudian slip i think i and congress long considered issues they felt system could set public financing would substitute private financing one could reduce effects the second reason think first amendment bar congress done congress consciously deliberately statute left ample scope individual group expression turning first question purposes statute congress sought achieve think record demonstrates congress knew effects would passed public financing statute years debate statute limited expenditures prohibited contributions candidates created system public financing merely subsidy candidates two major parties seen substitute public financing major part package forms expenditures limited but congress knew committees would take role previously held large contributors one factors prominent debate front congress indeed set forth reply brief debate went 1971 went way back history statutes 1966 67 long long debates senate but congress estimated looked question whether prohibited private contributions came forward public financing would situation private financing would come forward making expenditures control candidate control candidates parties would done committees composed candidates supporters composed people i say business raising expending funds influence elections and congress concluded congress concluded situation would effect candidate would beholden large aggregations private funds candidate whose campaign limited 40 million recent election public financing looked saw groups available could make expenditures behalf millions dollars campaigns replace support campaign effect would essentially would wind election needing woo private money needing know that private money would come forward behalf thus would long run beholden private money way would beholden situation private contributions congress i know place congress actually considered alternative in course debates congress considered variety ways trying limit problem the difficulty i think congress belief strongly argued reach committees going difficulty standard committees seemed composed supporters point always debating reach statute far could reach and drew line political committees business i think concerns congress expressed throughout however theres another countervailing interest someone make determination two months election funding reduced in words one things congress saw system would immediate block grant known amount candidate would grave danger would interfering speech candidate public fund attempting support got system someone federal election commission form decisionmaker would decide well group allied candidate well reduce candidates funds and i think saw great difficulty systems involve kind interference yes i think question commission statute deal i would say two things one tremendous difficulty dealing period election yes i think congress spoke many terms they spoke fact knew past experience knew personal experience i mean debates full indications knew personal experience ways private money would flow system they historical examples front previous statutes had narrow definitions terms contribution expenditure political committees sprang ability prove immediate coordination perhaps need coordination sense direct contact expenditures spoke need control expenditures done political committees particularly ones comprised good deal conversation presidents clubs things rot directly control and congress foresaw congress predicted congress held long hearings questions presently court how could devise system method would allow reach counteract evil saw political committees composed people supporters presidential candidate because felt control degree would system would unlimited private spending candidate would held back candidates party held back balance would overthrown and sense i think 67 debates set forth prominently figured original long act proposition passed congress 1966 1967 sixweek debate front senate eventually made ineffective legislation passed the subject debate question whether subsidy two major parties restrictions kind restrictions stage contributions candidates party candidate variety restrictions accountability the congress debated issue sense whether to control private financing public financing situation in public financing situation commission interpreting provisions statute question 9012f said public financing statute deals major party candidates but taking question dealing major party candidates expenditure funds one candidates election candidate so way statute deals no i would say i think fact i think theres question statutory interpretation fact negative expenditure election i think theres nothing first amendment would permit sense negative expenditures positive expenditures reach first amendment would equal regards as well question congress i say i think one major thrust argument congress knew problem facing discussed great detail hearings testimony i would reemphasize broad constitutional debate it solely constitutional debate issue control expenditures there also constitutional debate propriety checkoff court resolved buckley versus valeo there proposals checkoff allow people designate parties checkoff felt many necessary interfere political parties there also strong debate structure public financing law would interfere rights third parties one factors control independent expenditures subsidy put forth puts third parties greater disadvantage i would deal two ways one i would say i think courts analysis buckley versus valeo made clear that balancing test i think court said buckley i think subsequent cases i would cite bellotti case carc case court spoken terms independent expenditures pose danger course question front congress sense front court but difference constitutional balance regard expenditures question expenditures affect process and sense i think balancing test rather full protection constitution expenditure kind i think thats implicit the berkeley case refer carc its citizens against rent control versus berkeley i think cases i think court dealt analysis question one governmental interest balance i would return fact yes i think 608e statute considered ran entire gamut it covered individuals groups political committees kinds associations dealt statute political committees political committees within meaning statute ones whose business influencing federal elections receive contributions it much narrower focus statute present statute buckley the second point i would want make broad debate considerable concern expressed congress is enshrined statute noted buckley versus valeo allowing individual group speech associational rights come forward political process they listed i dont want run significant ones first statute individuals limited expenditures appellees argue makes statute discriminatory it seems to contrary shows congress sensitive balance making constitution whose basic protections individual rights question whether individual rights associate operate group curtailed statute nonetheless protection individuals spend great importance there also protections statute volunteer activities expenditures toward political meetings groupings there tremendous congress balance felt striking i refer fact i think one things court referred i would say certainly ability join political associations again great discussion the right well i think question whether limit drawn low essentially legislative one question whether limited question dealt contributions area i agree one rights left contribute participate political associations again statute nothing curtail issue discussion we long discussion common cause versus schmitt questions issue group might move one seeking support candidate but centrally statute deal deals political committees 8000 presently 4000 political committees candidates parties the interpretation provision statute protecting press right it seems seems commission that functional analysis whether regular periodical but yes also statute 441b area internal communications limited seem areas congress exempted treated press differently i think would depend upon question periodical i think periodical appearing election broadside would held within protection section but would statutory interpretation problem regard 431f4b i guess section i think yes i think general proposition still holds true i think i think general proposition still holds true i think general proposition still holds true well i say general proposition holds true i think court said various cases saw took motive congress stop speech opposed limiting amounts expenditures elections that would go question motive congress i think would curtail expression political committees nil practical purposes yes that would different statute congress debated 1000 limit more would opened mr chief justice may please court it position cases congress intend section 9012f apply limiting independent expenditures we say congressional history legislative debate surrounding section 9012 fund act passed 1971 predecessor legislation honest election act 1967 and say wording statute secondly contend statute construed court reach independent expenditures cannot survive unconstitutional may sustained fosters goal guarding real apparent corruption and suggest court legislative evidence connection independent expenditures corruption record evidence connection this statute criminal statute operates inarguably first amendment area as suggest read construed narrowly section 9012f lifted almost word word section 310f honest elections act 1967 it reason argued court legislative debate surrounding statute pertinent section 310f result compromise senator long wanted simply fund presidential elections 67 act also funded senatorial elections and led senator gore wanted fund presidential senatorial elections aid public funding wanted limit expenditures others 310f compromise views we believe legislative debate surrounding 310f shows 9012f successor 310f intended force publicly funded candidates live within budget provided public grant limiting expenditures partyconnected nonauthorized committees pay language senate report honest elections act candidates expenses it your honor your honor i made argument papers i oral argument district court it your honor i take yes sir im seeking provide court way avoiding constitutional issue i presented papers argument your honor what happening 1967 congress seen happening partyconnected unauthorized committees committees authorized writing candidate make expenditures candidates behalf paying expenses candidate paying trips state instance that congress struck 67 act urge implication 9012f now 1971 precious little debate true intent section 9012f what debate however set brief centers debate senator pastore opposition curiously enough readily concede senator pastore one discussed independent expenditures argued sides case at one time said 9012f intended reach independent expenditures so long people independent candidate free speak said he one hand suggested one point debate might reach independent expenditures but end came back original position intended reach independent expenditures his opposition following lead senator gore back 1967 longer senate wanted expand section 9012f reach manner groups everyone save individuals they unsuccessful their effort turned back the debate 67 act 71 act extensive i read many many pages and i may wrong i believe i say court nowhere debate congress address independent expenditures independent groups the concern back nonauthorized partyconnected committees frankly bigtime independent expenditures exist back we believe reaches intended reach partyconnected expenditures candidate behalf otherwise somehow coordinated request suggestion and readily concede court construes way section 9012f today redundant unnecessary since 71 act passed congress characterized expenditures inkind contributions in 1974 so fund act would redundant excuse 9012f would redundant court read way but looking congressional intent 1971 fund act tampered since congress silent we believe wording 9012f supports argument that statute prohibits expenditures expenditures independent expenditures incurred candidate authorized committee would election we believe that awkward wording suggests congress striking expenses paid candidate and common sense basic principles statutory construction believe support contention statute read way one congress knew outlaw independent expenditures wanted this court trouble understanding thats congress intended 608e1 buckley congress didnt two congress really concerned independent expenditures real apparent corruption expenditures independent expenditures candidates struck goal curious way exempted wealthy individuals and wealthy individuals existed back 1971 certainly exist the record case shows ten individuals spent one million dollars support mr reagans election 1980 one spent sore half million dollars and finally curious congress put similar independent expenditure limitation thats primary act there restriction upon independent expenditures presidential primary campaign even though campaign publicly funded now court buckley upheld fund act two grounds first means eliminating influence large private corruptions excuse contributions secondly means relieving candidates rigors fundraising section 9012f furthers neither goals first addresses expenditures contributions secondly candidates already publicly funded longer face ordeal fundraising each 1984 received 40 million furtherance campaign in addition 9012f exempts individuals exempts institutions press broadcast media woefully underinclusive leaves field independent expenditures wide open influential groups individuals where statute like 9012f operates area first amendment freedoms upheld serves compelling governmental interest even narrowly drawn achieve end since buckley clear statute limits campaign expenditures compelling interest sufficient uphold statute avoidance real apparent corruption we already argued congress intend 9012f reach independent expenditures but court finds buckley teaches corruption must evil aimed statute corruption and there much talk corruption resulting contributions independent expenditures indeed precious little talk independent expenditures almost didnt exist back fund act passed secondly legislative connection whatever independent expenditures corruption first i said independent expenditures almost didnt exist secondly 1976 court found record complete record evidence corruption sufficient uphold independent expenditure limitation its wonder congress didnt find corruption 1971 it indeed concerned corruption arising contributions your honor independent expenditures it indeed concerned corruption relieve possibility corruption direct contributions candidates said we permit instead publicly fund candidates may ask may accept contributions just 1976 record evidence corruption none 1984 the district court exhaustively examined record the record consisted 200 stipulations and noted complete absence real apparent corruption it found little considered things mainstream american political tradition but democrats apparently concerned evidence direct corruption tried persuade lower court appearance corruption and tried poll public opinion poll the lower court discussed it properly rejected poll view hope courts view well the constitutionality legislation ought turn national plebiscite  it congress find it congress find reality appearance corruption man street  well your honor first understanding way congress would find corruption proper way would hold public hearings take testimony its appealing notion legislation ought passed plebiscite for instance we didnt poll we would loved polls well your honor exactly your honor it would indeed think legitimacy statute turn answers thousand people asked couple questions weekend couple years ago secondly statute narrowly drawn achieve legitimate goal avoidance corruption no maam i would i believe thats perfectly legitimate goal congress but one expressed passing legislation this statute narrowly drawn achieve end there narrow means achieve end sought end congress sought elsewhere provided act suggesting congress really outlawing independent expenditures mind first there elsewhere federal election laws requirements disclosure independent expenditures ncpac fcms independent expenditures publicly reported federal election commission all expenditures public communications funded candidates others way contain disclaimers connection candidate identification group speaking yes your honor donors yes your honor gross amounts no your honor mr steele probably correct theres 50 200 threshold i dont think donors names must disclosed if im aware one similarity contributors im aware study done your honor finally groups like ncpac prohibited reproducing candidates campaign materials limits amount contributions political committees all less restrictive effective means already exist statute congress need taken meataxe approach outlawing effective independent expenditures your honor let hasten say i didnt intend concede all right your honor justice rehnquist ago asking questions courts right work opinion whether simply controls case resolves issue altogether it two reasons first mr feirson pointed fec regulation says political committees may incorporate yet still avoid proscriptions corporate expenditures contained 441b they may incorporate liability purposes and two statute court today restricts expenditures political committees defined fund act federal election campaign act including groups incorporated otherwise so case albeit unincorporated political committee would court today court viewed fecs regulation disposing issue your honors throughout fecs dncs briefs refer us nominally independent professionally run effective candidate knows helping at one point one appellants refers ability groups like appellees exert significant influence political process we think code words saying effective effective speech ought choked we understand law permit mr steele suggested argument messages publicly funded candidates somehow interfered independent expenditures engaged appellees we aware anybody america feels candidates able get messages across they also refer expenditures mere subsidy supplement those code words they suggest somehow coordinated publicly funded candidate that in fact 1980 common cause cartermondale committee filed administrative complaints appellees almost three years investigation fec came emptyhanded it took action us whatsoever coordination claims claim the fact coordinated finally perhaps importantly mr steele suggests appellees independent expenditures candidates might somehow beholden appellees first theres record whatever record evidence whatever score secondly please consider mr steele really suggesting what saying candidates clients pool small contributions many ordinary citizens citizens ordinary means spend support candidate expenditures might cause candidate pay attention voters well american way understand what mr steele really concerned expenditures might effective candidate might realize voters getting message would responsive voters well point process understand in short seems appellants position groups like ncpac pcm many contributors better see heard troop polls obediently every election day vote go home participate party process we think case silence golden statute intended congress reach independent expenditures it cant thank you,452.0,533,37,well hear arguments next federal election commission national conservative political action committee related case mr steele may proceed whenever youre ready i one question mr steele is argument diminished force fact fec brought suit case from corrosive effects public financing couldnt congress achieved pretty much result without limiting speech third parties saying contributing takes place private group appears coordinated candidate lose much public financing represented coordinated expenditures well thought stemmed fact i think congress would stronger footing far first amendment concerned says going deduct money giving candidate youre dealing government handing money rather saying going forbid making certain kind expenditures speech well arent really talking uncoordinated independent spending i mean i thought cant election commission already get coordinated spending gets close enough really be blamed candidate yes to sustain law youre going to convince congress wholly uncoordinated committees how statute combination reach independent political action committee coordinated anyone candidate candidate candidate supports x y z positions and dont think thats impairment first amendment rights well mr steele notwithstanding concerns expressed congress fact buckley versus valeo spending political associations treated expenditures entitled protection first amendment full protection isnt problem deal what second case referred and think interest purely independent political associations different buckley versus valeo let interrupt mr steele seemed buckley court upheld provision limiting contributions one reasons court gave individuals could contribute political associations pool resources gain expression fashion and yet youre saying that aspect curtailed well so im wondering consistent buckley well thats pretty hollow right join association association limited spending 1000 that isnt much right can political committee simply avoid limit publishing periodical endorses candidate editorial well could one committees matter characterized simply avoid limitation publishing kind periodical let go back statement fixing amounts congress and course conceding generally thats true suppose instead 1000 100 same and 50 one dollar what could much first amendment expression engage one dollar 50 100 well wouldnt one dollar effect stop wouldnt almost absolute barrier expression then though congress would say no committees would permitted express mr feirson this statutory argument i take and district court say then district court didnt address and youre making alternative argument affirmance i would think district court would reach statutory argument first presented may i ask what view 9012f reach doesnt reach expenditures isnt possible least infer debates congress concerned corruption passed 9012f well appearance corruption valid purpose something congress may legislate cant appearance corruption determined plebiscite you argue seems perhaps appearance corruption something high scale constitutional values corruption concede appearance corruption something congress legislate shouldnt appearance corruption proveable poll like testimony pollster yes yes exactly well wouldnt one weaknesses plebiscite poll depend framed question would reject completely valid goal preservation public confidence integrity elections are names donors required disclosed in report commission no matter amount i think bottom limit has ever study made congress anyone public study coordination incidence donors independent committee party committee that would evidence coordination i suppose well concede statutory construction argument resolved least purposes argument say congress go i think admit congress thought necessary go means say think perfectly adequate no i meant argue extent statute going necessary necessarily assume statutory construction argument resolved differently say do anything mr steele you five minutes remaining,952.0,1382,6,mr chief justice may please court with respect question chief justice posed abort dollar limitations might well remember somewhat analogous provision federal election laws section 441b congress applied absolute prohibition upon corporations unions expending amount money independent expenditures election candidates federal office and i think particular provision helpful trying analyze well mr justice rehnquist i think go back look nrwc case rationale corporations always treated differently ability aggregate wealth use corporate form in fact deal particular appellees also dealing corporate form incidents goes no section would pertain inasmuch federal election commission regulation registered political committee thereby taken underneath 441b so essence difference appellees case nrwc case nrwc failed register particular provision particular regulation federal election commission would taken underneath 441b i think clear record appellees corporations they corporations almost identical nrwc that nonprofit corporations members i dont believe correct the argument nrwc fact cannot distinguish corporate form nrwc corporate form appellees indeed made district court i think judge becker saying attempting distinguish nrwc different case following reason he said corporations youre dealing corporations youre dealing economic entity rather ideological entity basis distinction i think thats faulty basis nrwc economic entity ideological entity similar appellees fact purpose appellees attempt influence federal elections my basic point look nrwc entity corporate form structured look 441b prohibition absolute difficult impossible find distinction case particular party particular appellees they corporations nonprofit corporations ideological corporations none three parties input contributors run managed expenditures made so 441b situation present nrwc court unanimously upheld total prohibition independent expenditures what fund act somewhat less restrictive limitation permit 1000 spending limit and would urge court closely look 441b nrwc analogy see distinctions constitutional dimension there always distinctions would argue very fact distinctions constitutional dimension earlier questions focused difference coordinated expenditures independent expenditures part problem setting i think problem congress recognized virtually impossible space election campaign time candidates nominated time election held federal election commission decisionmaking body determine coordinated expenditure for example respect justice rehnquists question different type statutory scheme candidates dollar totals would go coordinated expenditures made well put position candidate impossible choice if say candidate youll 40 million unless time later somebody decides somebody made coordinated expenditure candidates going say thank that practical reality if public funding scheme going work candidates going accept public funding every single major party presidential candidate done since went effect must certainty there must certainty get full grant thats coming otherwise theyre going to turn say ill take chances getting private contributions and soon start focus much distinction independent coordinated expenditures get i think worms difficult decision theyre factoriented theres way made within space campaign i think also important considering 9012 interacts provisions fund act remember whole fund act court found buckley enhances pertinent first amendment valves releasing candidates rigors fundraising in words two things it gives candidates time discuss issues important country rather trying raise funds addition enables candidates theory discuss issues open freeflowing fashion worry might affect potential financing support i dont suggest second one preferred first amendment purposes what i suggest balance two black white situation appellees come say first amendment rights violated unless show compelling governmental interest youre going lose what im saying even get compelling governmental interest court ought take consideration competing countervailing first amendment values well i think case court focusing court focused subduing speech rich versus poor easterners versus westerners what mutual provision its liberal conservative east west north south it goes particular type organism particular type organization like corporation like labor union it organism aggregates wealth like corporation like labor union and court nrwc said within congress discretion make determination organizations like corporations labor unions i believe quote similar organizations worthy type regulation and would submit appellees similar types organizations they aggregate funds spend money and 9012f attempt regulate expenditure funds individuals spending money it attempt regulate expenditure funds groups groups people actually band together pool money spend all 9012f attempts regulate organism accumulates funds contributors contributors control say funds spent political committee and circumstance 9012f would apply and i think different situation buckley across board type prohibition with respect justice oconnors question whether 1000 limitation make small contributors contribution rights hollow i dont think and reason i think focus speech right contributor and i think that true buckley we would submit true there pooling record undisputed contributor money goes absolutely say money spent even spent when appellees record undisputed send solicitations saying send us many dollars suchandsuch presidential candidate well point would committees required significant participation would likely come underneath definition would like thats correct thank i would like first deal issue statutory interpretation we set forth reply briefs footnotes 2 3 think that dealt appellees court it seems us effectively conceded statute covers expenditures papers district court answer complaint stated expenditures would make also statement advisory opinion request sought commission with regard point relating statutory history intention congress reply brief sets forth length well opening brief discussions held congress it seems clear first term independent expenditures used i would note 608e that clearly import court dealt buckley versus valeo 608e broad expenditure limit struck court but discussion congress related question private money there considerable discussion contributions there considerable discussions expenditures so concept congress understand kinds expenditures would come forth publicly financed system one expenditure limitation candidate expenditure limitations party prohibition private contributions candidate limitations contributions party seems one totally odds nature congress experts know great deal campaign financing discussed senator gore 1967 raised whole question efficacy long act said rejecting one arguments i think made favor statute could said long act well subsidy listed explicitly nine points the second nine points precisely expenditures would made unauthorized committees the whole debate led honest elections act 1967 reported dealing question deal unaccountable expenditures it form complaint made statute passed 1966 statute carried forth 1971 finally i would say regard question whether everything code word effectiveness i think indeed true congress aiming section 9012f committees would able conduct kind national campaign cost millions dollars there question sought prohibit political committees precisely able that mean i think would mean court congress intending cut individuals rights speech association individuals protected volunteer activities theyre protected statute terms making expenditures there variety ways congress dealt so answer regard effectiveness yes precisely reason congress saw independent committees could found independent course election danger local radio local radio one things set forth the record great deal evidence put precisely regard point i think referred brief summation printed appendix record printed appendix stipulation facts amount advertising individual could buy and said brief regard discussion taft amendment dont think reach statute reach statute political committees groups individuals pooling funds top ads could get local newspaper local radio station even local tv station very small theyd take no question again i think precise balance congress really concerned debates get handle limiting large aggregations wealth came political committees expenditure without interfering rights individuals small groups a long discussion pastore amendment groups columbia university professors ive never known chose hypothetical but precise balance congress trying make reach aggregations political committees interfere individuals small groups rights influence it would sufficient mount national campaign precise shadow campaigns spoken congress concerned if dont limit unauthorized political committees expenditures congress felt would kinds campaigns and weve set forth brief mentioned seems come true here statute prohibits commission said prohibited activities long time its challenged appellees they mounted major campaigns if prohibition 8000 political committees could thing the size considerably larger public fund whatever public fund but answer question put record attempts show individual could buy terms local advertising i think i would say regard minor party candidates major party candidates dealt differently fund act minor party candidates i think yes i think would extraordinary situation would make court go behind but given hypothetical i think yes commission power look behind find purpose campaign election one major party candidates i would say that would interpretation statutory language thats involved section section 9012f again i say i think would extraordinary instance would effect nonbona fide candidate president but purpose i think purpose question would come focus section 9012f statute no i dont mean say i dont think difficulties involved i think one things commission wrestle advisory opinion process prospects 1980 coming 1984 fact might third party candidates publicly financed implications as always short space general election one reasons would see statute difficult commission get space election,245.0,327,18,its mistake the light seems order mr marshall you may continue in right work committee decision court couple years ago deal prohibition corporations unions case went proposition corporations always treated differently purposes political expenditures since way way back individuals i dont see supports anything political committee well extent youre dealing corporate form probably get section involved nrwc cant well certainly none arguments least reading judge beckers opinion district court suggest defendants corporations subjected corporate restrictions act well judge pecker distinguished nrwc opinion ground dealt corporations so strikes argument least wasnt made court well is one preferred another first amendment purposes a lot line analysis followed court appeals district columbia circuit buckley valeo squarely rejected court idea enhance first amendment values subduing peoples speech increasing peoples speech well i think contribution right isnt at least relied upon court buckley right speak individual group means means pooling assets amplify voice well i suppose congress could regulate extent committees must require participation hasnt chosen but may subject congress could regulate presumably mr sparks mr steele may i interrupt minute how suggest individual 150 200 300 make expenditure would sense relevant campaign where would make locally how much advertising buy 150 is brief record what would dimensions 100 ad new york times could find let try another hypothetical i think historical background a national campaign third party candidate president realistic analyses prospect but independent totally independent uncoordinated committees formed support predictable result drain votes one candidates and lets even assume

exchange recipients agreement compete paradigmatic antitrust trust violation the question presented whether payment treated lawful encompassed within settlement patent infringement suit the answer question reverse payments settle hatchwaxman suits objectionable reasons payments compete generally objectionable they subvert competitive process giving generic manufacturers incentive accept share rivals monopoly profits substitute actual competition i mean really two differences  scenario one presented the first exclusive license expressly authorized patent act section 261 title 35  second thing the second thing exclusive license doesnt give  infringement defendant anything couldnt hope achieve prevailing lawsuit that  least right compete wouldnt get prevailing lawsuit if infringement defendant would able sell wherever wanted now may but point but point money given substitute earning profits competitive marketplace that  hatchwaxman settlement context definition disagreement parties relative merits infringement  andor invalidity questions patent infringement suit the brand name saying patent valid infringed the generic saying either patent invalid conduct wont infringing and generic wins able enter market immediately if brand name wins able keep generic patent expires and circumstance logical subject compromise would agree upon entry date two end points parties damages action would expected settle case defendant agreeing pay portion money would pay lost thats actual subject compromise dont problem yes yes adopt respondents conception means act within scope patent and let explain when respondents say restrictions issue within scope patent mean goods restricted arguably encompassed patent restriction doesnt extend past date patent expires thats mean and exclusive test defendants masonite new wrinkle inline material would hook cases involved restrictions trade patented goods period patent effect yet court found antitrust liability now way respondent tries explain masonite example masonite involved resale price maintenance agreement patentholder sold goods attempted control price would resold court said rule patent exhaustion patentholder didnt right therefore patent laws provided shield agreement held violation antitrust laws now respondents say well thats consistent theory restriction imposed went beyond scope patent right control resale one rights patent act confers but thats test whether restriction within scope patent would say met theres nothing patent act says pay competitor engage conduct believe infringing and really thats thrust position  patentholder nonsham allegation particular mode competition would infringement patent patentholder pay competitor engage competition again talking conduct judicial determination infringement occurred we talking cases patentholder nonsham allegation infringement would occur well ftc consistently taken position the department justice 2009 didnt endorse scope patent test indeed invitation brief joblove specifically said scopeofthepatent test  didnt provide enough scrutiny settlements but advocated department justice advocated instead test would focus strength scope patent that likelihood brand name would ultimately prevailed suit litigated judgment and 2009 first time amicus brief filed second circuit took essentially position taking agreements sort treated presumptively unlawful presumption able rebutted various ways we would say thats way well test whether payment would tend skew parties choice entry date would tend provide incentive parties  generic agree entry date later one would otherwise insist now probably case test would greater practical import cases parties perceive patent well i think kind settlement would regard legitimate parties simply agree compromise date generic entry parties would certainly take account assessment would likely happen end suit and parties believe brand name likely prevail brand name agreed early generic entry would presumably fairly small amount time conversely parties collectively believe generic  brand name weak case generic likely prevail would negotiate earlier date and problem reverse payment gives generic incentive accept something competition means earning money i mean take another these suits  types payments appear essentially unknown lawsuits patent infringement cases congress tried reduce incentives payments made well couple things i would say first i dont think  asking overturn established antitrust laws to take along analogy example watson instead developing generic equivalent androgel developed entirely new drug believed would better androgel conditions solvay paid watson seek fda approval seek market drug i think everyone would agree that per se antitrust violation even though watsons ultimate ability market new drug would depend fda approval might might granted and say unlawful buy uncertain competition unlawful buy competition even competition might prevented means enforcing standard antitrust principles to focus distinction hatchwaxman patent litigation professor hovenkamps conclusion reason dont see payments like normal patent infringement suit typical market patentholder known paid large sum money competitor making challenge patent competitors knew that happened would perceive sign patent weak would leap but says hatchwaxman makes difficult done hatchwaxman gives unique incentives first paragraph 4 filer its 180day period exclusivity yes way works exclusivity period good consumers that period one generic market others yet allowed compete essentially duopoly conditions price drug drops little bit congress granted 180day exclusivity period wanted generics ample incentives challenge patents perceived weak and first filer able essentially bought able set settle something early entry marketplace potential competitors face barriers entry  similarly situated competitors wouldnt face industries well  court recognized thing quick look approach i think even though case didnt use term “ quick look ” i dont believe ncaa v regents university oklahoma probably best example well thats  thats one im familiar ill need look back see i think would leave courts without guidance without guidance factors would appropriate well certainly proposed approach accounts it provides  provides really two different forms rebuttal first approach says face agreement compete generic agreed stay market defined period time payment gives rise inference agree  delay generic agreed longer period would otherwise reflect best assessment likelihood  success lawsuit but say basically two different types ways presumption could rebutted first parties show payment consideration delay commensurate value transferred payment  arrangement would entered even without larger settlement and second least accepting possibility brand names generics could come say even though payment delay even though cant identify anything else payment could consideration still quote “ competitive ” let say couple things administrative nightmare the first extent inquiries difficult theyre difficult  brand names generics made difficult tacking additional transactions settlement proposal and take analogy government ethics rules say  called prohibited sources basically people business department cant give gifts government employee now obviously would absurd rule said prohibited source couldnt give rolex watch could sell rolex watch dollar and ethics rules treat gift exchange value fair market value paid and everybody understands go route occasionally hard cases people could legitimately agree legitimate arms length exchange concealed gift but prospect difficult cases doesnt mean get rid gift ban altogether and certainly federal employees couldnt bring  ethics office knees engaging proliferation side deals ethics office decided worth the second thing respondents approach would apply even hard questions respondents would say even agreement provides delayed generic entry date patent expires even term agreement brand name pays generic lot money that would legitimate agreement restriction would apply arguably patented drugs wouldnt extend beyond date patent expiration i guess  thing i would say way payments facilitate settlement really shows anticompetitive potential that suppose parties negotiating compromise date entry couldnt agree  brand name said beginning 2017 earliest well let generic said beginning 2015 latest date would accept now respondents use term “ bridge gap ” theres obviously way payment brand name generic could enable parties agree entry date 2015 2017 the brand name never going say well i would insist holding 2017 im going pay whole lot money ill let earlier accept  diminution profits the brand name going say i pay money im going insist deferring entry even later 2017 date would otherwise preferred compromise so natural effect payments facilitate  bridging gap sense picking point dates parties would otherwise insist it going  likely cause parties agree entry date thats even later one brand name would otherwise find acceptable not  price fixing  agreement compete that parties agreeing prices charge the generic agreeing stay market first but would treated per se now wanted tweak theory way say cases payment agreement date market entry additional consideration exchanged beside wanted say plaintiff would bear burden showing fair exchange value  thats something would agree would fairly minor tweak theory the rule  i mean bad reasons administrability bad conceptually the reason bad reasons administrability  least i take proposing antitrust court would consider factors might bear assessment agreement would include presumably strength patent claim subjective its atypical  i mean  court ncaa example said agreement looking dealt allocation   allocation rights televised football games  essentially limitation output court said presumptively unlawful long experience market shown suspect the court didnt say long experience market television rights football it said output limitations established disfavored nevertheless competitive sports nature require degree cooperation people compete  establish rules game forth  look see whether parties identified  whether defendants identified anything specific industry would justify decision apply usual presumption concluded nothing and really asking court take approach were saying payments compete generally disfavored the parties  hatchwaxman settlement money passing brand name generic unusual settlement begin theres way suit could culminated generic receiving money judgment and therefore well  well look upon suspicion well give parties adequate opportunities  rebut if i may id like reserve balance time thank mr weinberger argued order determine whether settlement sort anticompetitive effects would know lawsuit would turned perhaps fundamental principle antitrust law particular conduct legal illegal depending deliberative process led and put concrete terms business charges particular price particular product made assessment maximize profits competitive environment decision almost immune antitrust scrutiny but business charges price product market agreed competitor charge price thats per se antitrust violation so anomalous say type agreement deemed anticompetitive even though result namely exclusion generic market might able obtained means the second thing mr weinberger said instances second successive filers attempt challenge brand name even first filer bought i think  disagree easy would say well concede happens occasionally but fact particular anticompetitive conduct doesnt always work doesnt make lawful it could often happen two firms thinking entering pricefixing agreement instance thought theres third competitor market able undersell us would make agreement unprofitable and might happen sometimes two firms try proceed pricefixing conspiracy theyre thwarted unexpected competition third firm i mean first certainly evidence suggesting happened often although evidence happened but brand name perceived systemic basis likely result paying one competitor another competitor would step couldnt bought would litigate suit judgment would incentive make reverse payment first place that making reverse payment  brand name attempting purchase protection possibility patent invalidated suffer large competitive advantage if brand name thinks particular instance somebody else whos going expose  risk  payment wouldnt expected made so least i think reasons  question suggested 180day exclusivity period leaving aside cases waived subsequent manufacturers would realize wouldnt get period heightened profits would wait line others might focus attention patents perceived weak could hope  get 180day exclusivity contract i know great majority i dont percentage figure and reason i indicated earlier 180day exclusivity period two competitors basically biopoly arrangement and understanding generics would usually charge around 80 85 percent brand names price period and full competition price would drop fraction the next thing i would say system encourages settlement nth degree and instance two  two firms fighting million dollars firm decided internally 600000 least i accept if stuck guns case couldnt settled now public could made kick additional 200000 firms could get 600000 walk away content but dont pursue policy favor settlement degree but thats essentially whats happening the  way payments facilitate settlement inducing generics agree later entry date increasing total pool profits available two firms combined thereby maximizing likelihood firm find share profit satisfactory and last thing i would say i think everyone comes issue recognized conundrum our natural instinct compare settlement expected outcome litigation but everyone also recognizes isnt feasible try patent suit and therefore approach focuses whether competitive process preserved,607.0,940,26,well hear argument next morning case 12416 federal trade commission v actavis mr stewart why  payments compete different lets say dividing market i mean suppose theres lawsuit somebody challenging validity patent patentee agrees allow person challenging patent exclusive  exclusive rights sell particular area does violate antitrust laws that  doesnt impress what else whats second point laughter in order make money i mean thats  thats wants money so instead giving license compete  know well shortcircuit whole thing heres money go away mr stewart case patentee acting within scope patent nonetheless held liable antitrust laws something done acting within scope patent mr stewart represent change governments position i got idea briefs time scheringplough case also eleventh circuit government taking position taking and one way assess validity strength infringement case thats concern test weak patent strong patent that doesnt make lot sense why wouldnt determination reflect strength weakness patent market forces take account this  problem i gather hatchwaxman amendments yes  suits kind payment and i  i feeling happened hatchwaxman made mistake it foresee would produce kind  kind payment and order rectify mistake ftc comes brings new interpretation antitrust law exist make mistake hatchwaxman made even though congress tried cover tracks later amendments right  deter these  payments so overturn understood antitrust laws  patch mistake hatchwaxman made is 18  18month rule primarily right i mean 180 days yes well doesnt mean  thats rather thin i dont know  i dont ability assess significance empirically the thing i wonder therefore said common antitrust im  im everything field i know theres existence something called per se rule lets price fix i know theres rule reason i know theres sort vague area sometimes cases justice souter mentioned california dental something slightly i saw cases theyre much like price fixing  agreements enter and seem say judge pay attention department says often anticompetitive ask defendant hes i mean want us say it didnt seem briefs if asking us produce kind structure  i dont mean pejorative rigid  whole set complex per se burden proof rules i never seen antitrust cases i  question i say ive never seen anything like terms procedure i want refer case show oh im date and others is are familiar because i want sure i read well none i would say isnt government satisfied opinion court says yes serious anticompetitive effects yes sometimes business justifications judge keep mind ask agreement ask justification see theres less restrictive alternative in words district court many complex cases structure case advice attorneys its got guidance the thing appropriate appropriate antitrust case are anticompetitive effects i 32 briefs explain clearly said sentence it may theyre simply dividing monopoly profit i understand  know i take every judge country and whats complicated and i nice dark green briefs clearly say four instances maybe five would offsetting justifications i think get and mention least two others the first one mention persons already market thinks next year two three years worth 100 million year person whos suing thinks worth 30 million year and says hey i great idea ill give 30 million keep 70 and  i dont see thats anticompetitive thats whats going and second instance bring hard break market so new generic come hes thinking giving two years isnt worth much ill spend lot money hard but defendant  defendant wants patent kept intact says i let  ill let year earlier ill give enough money start distribution system the second seems procompetitive first neutral the problem deciding whether matters are really payments something else true nightmare start talking five drugs different distribution systems matter whether youre paying litigation costs matter great debate judge okay thats arguments make go ahead mr stewart go back justice breyers question initial question its rare find per se antitrust violation most situations put rule reason you seem arguing price fixing reverse payment like price fixing fall something greater rule reason but rule reason bad as  thats really bottom line youre creating  i think thats justice breyer saying i mean  example i difficulty understanding mere existence reverse payment presumptively gives  changes burden plaintiff it would seem to bear burden  burden proving payment services value given high i dont know shift side so answer fundamental question why rule reason bad no i mean professor areeda least mind minor deity matter area major explains he says dont try precision give the quality proof required vary circumstances do know long took  i mean i  course i  i know little bit antitrust but i mean i think  know long takes take basic argument sometimes division profit monopoly profit it takes probably 3 minutes less and judges so say judge judge whats relevant and theres rule evidence dont waste jurys time so  shape case  goes  used go 40 years you shape case light considerations actually relevant useful provable respect case and district judges thats job so   im saying youd lose case they didnt side eleventh circuit they said theres violation okay ive got point but  im worried creating kind administrative monster thank mr stewart mr weinberger well i thought mr weinbergers point always going happen easy  said put sign neck saying generics line get payment that seems quite different saying theres another firm abstract  might want enter similar market sharing arrangement this different system and whats understanding would long line cases many cases and anything show i think justice kennedy asked  know much ones profits comes 180day period opposed happens thank counsel counsel the case submitted,1093.0,1658,23,mr chief justice may please court id like first respond question asked friend justice scalia minutes ago he asked cases court ever found restraint outside scope patent unlawful answer question  cases found violations antitrust laws based patentbased restraint object agreement restraint thats achieved agreement beyond scope could legitimately achieved patent for example attempt control downstream resale prices  products cannot simply exercising patent or attempt control sale unpatented products go beyond patent protect every  every case thats correct no justice sotomayor im arguing but  i want say i think patent system depends upon notion dont evaluate perspective antitrust laws patent restraint based upon whether could proved litigation that patent  patent infringed i think youre  youre accepting infringement what youre recognizing theres reasonable basis assert patent bona fide reasonable dispute parties ability settle dispute just party  someone entering license agreement  someone product claimed infringe patent sat negotiated license resolved yes but justice sotomayor many many license  i dont think thats correct thats many license disputes fact resolved  alleged infringer exiting market period time agreeing stay certain time and license yes  example could license agreement infringer agrees stay market x number years comes pays certain royalty now anybody could argue that royalty higher could result earlier entry theres always argument made delayed entry situation monopoly profits shared thats  inherent nature and take ftcs argument full force would mean situation anyone agreeing delayed entry theres value thats exchanged situation effect economic terms payment delayed entry theres difference i  ive obviously given lot thought whether kind intermediary test works i dont believe let explain first cant really measure whether anticompetitive effects settlement agreement without determining would happened case hadnt settled would litigated and patentee litigation would anticompetitive effects thats second circuit federal circuit concluded applying rule reason test saying first condition test met theres demonstration anticompetitive effects and cases  cases good illustrations im talking those tamoxifen cipro cases parties agreed socalled reverse payment settlements ftc would say basically per se lawful well really dont know unless assume could entered well depends would happened patent litigation so cant really tell whether theres anticompetitive effect i also say respect generic losing theres really risk generic one reasons see settlements industry theyre  theyre lower would situation  patent gave patentholder legal right exclude so unless theres reason theres reason believe couldnt reasonably assert patent entitled monopoly profits whole duration patent certainly well im saying  given situation i  i think  single situation evidence theres reasonable basis assert patent truth patent say 5050 chance prevailing i think could settlement like good faith any  situation theres  patent dispute theres tradeoff like examples i mentioned time value could  argument could made and fact true true natural inference motivations people simply divide profits consideration youd expect see every single patent dispute especially hatchwaxman would result settlement pays generic end patent market would let address your honor i dont think thats realistic  lets take industry specifically that ability challenge patent industry lower industry i think thats generic given right certify patent basically challenge patent without actually developed product gotten marketing force gotten factory putting product sale taking risk everyone else challenges patent take all  file nda roughly 300000 1 million size drugs thats lot certify and ftcs studies shown takes small chance winning something like 4 percent drug 130 billion justify generic suing brand name company and  happens cases its hatchwaxman cases its yes the second circuit recognized said  upon reflection consideration troubled one reasons troubled i trying answer justice kagan reality situation many potential challengers patent file nda 200 generic companies industry try adopt strategy paying profits generic theres going long line thats clearly correct either logic reference actual experience its true first filer given greater incentive products last 20 25 years experience doesnt show look hatchwaxman litigation weve cited  red brief discussed antitrust economists generic pharmaceutical association amicus brief many hatchwaxman cases involve multiple filers you five 10 many 16 companies challenging patents  one first filer so  must incentive  so i think experience says that kind extreme view incentives really true yes  solvay brief briefs its big advantage its big advantage its incentive first six months i dont debate that market opens well i think first problem  unpredictable its really hard figure gets sorted parties sitting settlement need i feel much clearer guidance thats right i  i believe thing brought i agree justice scalia i dont think alternative test  alternative test could fashioned would  would make sense one based strength patent but many reasons that undesirable result i  i dont think way court go lets say  i wouldnt concede cases settle like but lets  lets accept take case  strong patent patent long term lets say  evaluate strength patent conclude 10 15 good years remaining now generic  many generics sued risk minimal risk hatchwaxman response would i  would i drop lawsuit get entry date 2025 2028 that doesnt meet business needs i shareholders i investors i run business im going keep litigating unless give something value so thats agreements theyre saying well  remember cash payment there well first first parties often dont agree merits parties tend overconfident they think going win so sometimes hard come consensus entry date bargaining chip available i dont know evidence would i dont think actually ten years experience since circuit courts first began applying scopeofthepatent tests settlements since 2003 so pretty good window would happen no i think actually steady they roughly 25 30 percent pretty much constant dont really see huge blips depending particular court ruling if ftcs kind theskyisgoingtofall approach right everybodys going run would thought first eleventh circuit ruling federal circuit ruling second circuit ruling second eleventh circuit ruling would huge increases havent seen some numbers increased last year percentage total settlements steady they pretty much justice ginsburg first every settlement agreement involving one cases must filed ftc they hundreds and havent pointed single example thats case yes i want make clear i dont think could happen brand name company adopted strategy protect patent would  would held it would held many generic companies could easily challenge patents without actually manufactured product without putting sale etcetera so i think antitrust rule fashioned deal case extreme hasnt shown happen logically economic point view highly unlikely happen and reason starts happening empirically congress  loophole hatchwaxman causing really evidence that extreme example happened  congress deal it dealt exclusivity provision well i dont see examples cited brief its theory hypothetical theory data we years experience case of course i think thats true many  many patent litigations there hypothetical risk what im  i trying make point  number challenges basically unlimited put sign around neck says paying generic companies profits whoever wants challenge patent come going long line people companies it true thats doesnt happen its  true much easier challenge patent so industry potential challenger make major investment product get manufactured put sale litigate and lose going liable enormous damages thats case hatchwaxman all need file anda they nothing risk if lose havent lost damages they walk away so enormous difference risks hatchwaxman cases explains particular form settlements happen justice sotomayor i think economic reality cuts way it doesnt cut favor making rule makes difficult what im saying justice sotomayor i dont think legislation i dont think anything hatchwaxman supports idea purpose provide generic entry prior patent expiration what structure designed encourage challenges i dont think anything hatchwaxman suggests way settlements  discouraged cases mandated proceed judgment litigated its encouraging challenges produced many challenges and i say 10 years application scopeofthepatent rule particular problem hatchwaxman its working well the amount  number drugs gone generic 10 years ago today increased enormously well i actually think raise point generic  amicus briefs generic parties talked ability challenge cases depends litigate every one conclusion and thats bad patent cases settle most  disputes settle and system one every case litigated fully judgment would unable cope so  i think statute mandates contemplates generics able challenge strong incentive challenge doesnt mean required litigate conclusion and settlement made difficult different perceptions different business objectives cant bridged kind business settlement going mean fewer generics going challenge patents contrary purpose hatchwaxman act this particular drug i dont know i mean lots studies much average drugs cost figure billion dollars easily billion dollars this particular drug no 12b6 motion motion dismiss none ever developed but i going say  course given drug development cost doesnt even begin tell picture every drug succeeds least 10 fail costs involved drugs fail covered one drug succeeds not completely first depends  agreement for example case 180day exclusivity waived this exact problem congress addressed 2003 amended hatchwaxman changed exclusivity requirements so way law reads subsequent generics subsequent filers trigger 180day exclusivity continuing litigate so first filer settles folks line theyre litigating force period start running come right so correct tie first filer settlement prevent everybody else entering and even amendment eleventh circuit federal circuit second applying scope patent rule recognized agreement creates bottleneck filers goes beyond statutory exclusivity provides agree give exclusivity agree retain thats beyond scope patent cant achieve kind restraint simply  patent  youre using agreement expand upon patent rights block filers so i think problems addressed congress and somebody feels solutions perfect want make even easier subsequent filers come i submit congress that the change made justice ginsburg  number changes one thats relevant  subsequent filer  strike you trigger exclusivity beginning run getting judgment so past first filer settled didnt anything  may i finish and didnt anything would prevent generics coming market but anybody else whos litigating patent go ahead win case  triggers first filers rights dont exercise  rights within 75 days theyre gone theyre forfeited so thats change thank thank your honor,755.0,1074,27,why isnt meaning presumption infringement theres presumption item someone else going sell necessarily infringes so youre arguing fact settlement infringement action creating presumption i dont know i dont know would required accept would infringement product voluntarily decided pursue rights but youd know theyre sharing profits meaning know  products licensed  thats normal the infringer paying side money sell product a reverse payment suggests something different theyre sharing profits i dont know else conclude but many reverse payments yes but  point per se unlawful what want want cut kind line per se rule kitchen sink and look brief supporting kitchen sink you economists attacking patent system praising da da da and they dont want kitchen sink now suppose i dont want kitchen sink i hard time saying per se rule so whats argument would  would help  thinking rules caps consider branding company would  would made generic company would lost  use latter limit well  make extrapolation yes well generic wins though  everybodys profits lower and gear  generic would made mr weinberger i understand youre saying maybe hypothetical suppose  lawsuit generic sends brand name manufacturer email email says lawsuit i think i 50 percent chance winning if i win i take  monopoly profits 100 million 10 million wouldnt good thing gave 25 million all right and brand name sends email back says  know seems like pretty good idea ill give 25 million now i understand argument i mean thats fine thats hunky dory is fine even though  isnt good faith its clear whats going theyre splitting monopoly profits person whos going injured consumers well mr weinberger i think give rule youre suggesting give going outcome going incentive generic brand name manufacturer every single case split monopoly profits way detriment consumers is cases hatchwaxman cases because skew dynamics lot you know second circuit recognized even though accepted scope patent troubling dynamic youre arguing less sound patent youre going hurt consumers cases payoff sharing profits greatest inducement patentholder okay suppose well i dont think thats true mr weinberger something justice scalia suggested theres kind glitch hatchwaxman glitch 180 days goes first filer and 180day first filer bought nobody else incentive but  huge percentage profits done exclusivity period i mean true go long time youre making dribs drabs money long time where youre really making money 180 days what  look verify say is  briefs because i thought justice kagans question might indicate 180 days crucial allows go doctors give name generic equivalent et cetera thats big advantage and youre  youre indicating isnt okay suppose  sounds like argument discussion district court   whats reaction say a sometimes settlements anticompetitive dividing monopoly profit in deciding whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices without less restrictive alternatives judge may take account 2 take account strength patent 3 try relitigate patent 4 several possible justifications ones i listed briefs litigation costs  products different assessments  value 5 could fact anticompetitive effect said response justice kennedy justice kagan could we dont know okay so start could anticompetitive give defense chance go five 1 5 convince 6 saying isnt cant think one briefs let 6th now judge weigh decide thats so weve structured somewhat keep kitchen sink basis briefs given us whats wrong you cant  cant possibly figure without assessing strength patent isnt crucial  conclusion and say consider every factor strength patent  leave  leave  elephant room for and   know government basically saying really dont want reverse payments period we want people settle way settle strength patent and means settling simply either paying royalty use settling cases early entry alone theres sharing   profits whats bad i mean doesnt deprive either side ability finish litigation want well normal course patents really strong get year two earlier entry inherent value thats youll pay government saying that determination two parties make point earlier entry worth strong patentholder well pointed settlements say vast majority well know reverse payments except recent times people figured valuable exception rule they increasing number decreasing what consideration seems driving government that generic getting offer would never get street i mean paid much would get patent infringement suit if patent infringement suit sell generic competition brand agreement get would get winning lawsuit but economic well suppose  suppose hypothetical correct thats concerns what brand company lose much greater generic make so dont put cap generic make wont real concern restraint trade well lesser concern i think thats thrust justice ginsburgs question concern well i thought government telling us thats case  generic offered way sharing monopoly profits could ever make wanted sold drug well hypothetical generic wins everybody  brand companies profits going go way way right away generic profits going great well question still holds if  key payment brand company make much higher figure greater danger unreasonable restraint okay i grant point 180 days big difference many generics but isnt true every industry you said outset oh well drug industry lot people ready pounce isnt true industry i see argument economic reality hatchwaxman would require us apply rule choose accept situations thats argument youre creating theres different economic reality requires different rule oh hatchwaxman congress decided benefit generics entering without suffering potential loss enter market quickly and settlement cases deprives consumers potential benefit earlier entry exactly permitting settlements kind permitting process go conclusion its encouraging infringement suits so help say court says ftc says get one suits settle letting cant pay money that help stop strike suits it costs nothing get they really want enter wont bring lawsuits so hurt i think correct develop new drug sometimes need scientists attorneys need investment bankers and need marketers cost drugs hundreds millions is anything record shows development cost drug it billion anything case anything record im sorry go ahead could i make sure i understand way 180day period worked the first filer gets i buy  im brand name manufacturer i buy first filer one reverse payments youre suggesting thats going much good theyre going  theres going long line and long line people dont get 180day period like even one people wins person ive paid going get 180day exclusivity period isnt right but waived parties words like i dont get incentives go its competitor gets so world i standing line  challenge competitor going get exclusive period well

evidence mr caylor wrote hes going stand thats critical objection now youre right theres nothing wrong mr razatos taken stand case theres nothing wrong described typical procedures lab i think objection youre pointing one said  far state law objection saying cant testify something doesnt personal knowledge whether procedures followed case but mr  mr razatos could certainly take stand testify  general procedures but page 54 55 joint appendix  simply reads reports results and two confrontation clause violations really you report introduced first instance  i believe 54 55 joint appendix you prosecutor asking mr razatos result he says result was21 as state says page 58 note 15 brief independent analysis applied all mr razatos was repeating giving jury conclusions mr caylor reached if said nothing the21 coming machine i think probably now judge michael first circuit would disagree thats issue thats case i think could debate whether  even considered hearsay operator well  well question would arise would whether the21 treated mr caylors statement let  i give two hypotheticals maybe explains on one hand i dont think anyone would claim time stamp fax machine example human statement its machine statement therefore cant testimonial on hand someone types affidavit word processor hits print cant say well thats machine talking human so question arises lab context whether a21 anything else comes machine enough human influence ought treated  persons statement now dont resolve case whats important emphasize that hypothetical the21 even though state would like case really miles away reason said state proved lot than21 mr caylors lab report thats hypotheticals i think important the state could the state could make choice would considerably weaker case justice alito wouldnt anyone saying procedures actually followed case also case would far weaker case theyd somebody stand would subject crossexamination recently put unpaid leave that that defense justice alito heres lab report still important though because youre right admit drunk but remember convicted simply dui convicted new mexico law aggravated dui and aggravated dui need a16 blood alcohol content so report state could proved over16 even mr bullcoming admitted drinking day so thats important case thats wanted challenge  thats one reason wanted challenge report let come back  important point i think though state wants able  i dont want ascribe bad motive states rule would allow states insulate people crossexamination mr caylor case   please pay attention example dungo case thats cited opening brief california thats case coroner fired job blacklisted law enforcement prohibited testifying many counties falsified reports autopsy reports writing police report sitting right next and well  could melendezdiaz makes clear doesnt satisfy confrontation clause and deal especially garden variety dui case much time resources issue thats confrontation clause i think especially important case like prosecution bring witnesses court and i could finish dungo story  california court appeal reviewed case said prosecutors intent case shield mr  im sorry  actual analyst case crossexamination and fact supervisor took stand preliminary hearing told  told court reason prosecutors find hard person court so would perfectly permissible  state win case today surrogate testimony allowed let give two answers justice ginsburg first let say dont know whether somebody doesnt remember hes put stand what nacdl brief says even though analysts dont ordinary remember runofthemill tests like remember something went wrong something went haywire so wouldnt know but assuming youre right thats understanding justice scalia so thats another reason may remembered but even didnt theres two things could importantly probed one credibility and ive explained serious issue case put unpaid leave the competence again melendezdiaz says important person stand explain job jury observe professionalism explain heres understanding procedures et cetera that could important i could leave one thing i of course justice scalia and flip side even doesnt remember crossexamination important if i could leave one thing i think isnt highlighted brief maybe way theres line cases court california v green delaware v fensterer united states v owens hold witness takes stand doesnt remember anything confrontation clause still  still satisfied long witness stand reason justice scalia explained jury observe et cetera and flip side  holding owens recently meaningful things confrontation clause requires and flip side cases witness takes stand doesnt remember ineffectiveness potentially crossexamination doesnt matter either if i could reserve little time i left thank let try make four quick points first justice alito i said first objection ja 40 actually 4445 joint appendix with regard states argument whether document testimonial i would simply urge court take close look lab report its ja 62 at top says mr chief justice response question arresting officer identification officer writes check blood alcohol concentration thats order lab if look bottom certification analyst certifies following true correct signs name perhaps critical thing bottom actual rules new mexico evidence law criminal procedure law referenced so exactly like melendezdiaz this document expressly prepared substitute live testimony not oath certification actually different oath makes worse crawford court said would implausible trial affidavit would prohibited trial unsworn affidavit would okay they say much thing there  several rules referenced bottom make automatically admissible notwithstanding hearsay rule prove truth matter asserted with respect justice ginsburgs question retesting exactly right the state many choices case  case proceed but wanted mr razatos witness  retest write new report witness there reason would introduce mr caylors report come state law issue mr razatos could live witness and i think  im sorry i think goes last point justice breyer youre talking states  ill combine answer two things a continuance would perfectly  perfectly appropriate scenario arisen mr chief justice thats  one thing public  public defender service brief talks 23  26 jurisdictions encompassing 23 different states follow rule advocating today and  asking witnesses its important  isnt multiple witness problem asking different witness in words state brought wrong witness thank you,824.0,1224,49,we hear argument first morning case 0910876 bullcoming v new mexico mr fisher mr fisher say presence  mean necessarily must courtroom would videoconferencing setup permissible technician analyst could testify lab rather  would screened  courthouse the defendant didnt give consent dont  thats concern lets  lets suppose defendant doesnt stipulate is adequate meet confrontation clause what police witnesses what requiring officer  took confession witnessed alleged crime  requiring appear hes busy cant make hes beat so appear television why  lab technician different mr fisher two people procedure theyre sitting know chairs right next the one know takes blood samples vials puts another vial puts aluminum stuff crimps the one takes vials puts machine runs do testify no want they want present results blood analysis numbers machine spits even though one even though one didnt even though question going put aluminum crimp answer going joe sits right next im sorry thats right does  testify i  i dont understand how different supervisor lab saying i know people i  i watch daytoday basis perform work correctly what state wanted introduce result exam chief justice gives hypothetical say two people necessary exam you say one saw but  hearsay first person  crimping crimping thing its direct testimony person you didnt say experienced crimping did use right hand left hand is danger spillage and all beyond ability defense ask the state takes chances right i mean much bring in order persuade jury you always take chances business record thats given course of course state takes chance  admission admissible hearsay testimony jury  youll make argument jury discount person isnt thats always true now i take testimonial statement blood taken hospital blood defendant thats testimonial statement and i assume case nurse police officer present but i assume position could record showing  nurse withdrew sample 1008 pm suchandsuch date followed regular procedure that would insufficient state wanted introduce certificate  record well thats  i dont think thats melendezdiaz footnote 1 says it says state may able prove chain custody testimony actual individuals handled sample take chances whether trier fact going believe  going believe isnt right it  does melendezdiaz also say defendant wants challenge  chain custody state adopt rules requires defendant assert challenge intention make challenge intention make challenge prior trial state know whether introduce live testimony but chain  chain custody involve testimonial statement blood i took 1005 pm saturday evening thats testimonial statement its defendants blood but its chain custody i think chief justice trying get problem i lab technician jones looks vial blue she says smith blue smith turns lever machine b jason sees b goes court  make go court thats case and i wonder is defendant entitled following instruction jury hes court say machine read b proves nothing vial nothing all proves someone said laboratory another person two people arent court now thats  see thats problem i think intermediate step id either like told im wrong dont explain whatever youd like well want tell us dont worry wont happen i think thats unacceptable argument youre saying defense certain rights presume defense attorney whos going afford client every right constitution so fact supposed worry wont happen often seems unlikely hypothetical b seems irrelevant argument mr fisher i thought  i thought court put worry behind us crawford wasnt worry raised crawford said yes may something risk states managed past theres reason think cant manage future counsel different types hearsay involved different types statements theres report exhibit 1 introduced certain certifications analyst followed certain procedures et cetera im assuming youre claiming  confrontation clause violations exhibit attesting certifying something the witness trial well thats i want that  also i summarized saying followed certain procedures accordance law et cetera right all right but persons now  i might finish question okay go ahead yes lets assume raw data graphs made reviewed separate witness reviewed data says data shows blood level concentration was21 twopoint whatever would violate confrontation clause using raw data the printout machine that wasnt introduced i correct all right but lets assume lets assume took raw data trial i know chain custody someone prove data related mr bullcoming but expert read data testified certain amount percentage alcohol would violate confrontation clause and thats  thats new mexico supreme court suggested didnt they said bring printout gas  whatever  chromatograph expert one certified  caylor  heres graph came machine way process operates i  answer justice sotomayor mean agree new mexico supreme court said printout plus analyst didnt particular run knows process works what part what part see testimonial what outside expert look well i  theres two different issues one introduced evidence reports testify different question thats form evidence and thats line im trying get describe testimony become violation confrontation clause lets assume hypothetical i proffered could break  way i see three things  three statements  state attempting  prove the first sample tested sample taken defendant second standard procedures followed case third result was21 would agree those three things all right that sample tampered now first three words everything results could state prove things without  simply introducing testimony regarding way things generally done lab ask jury infer general procedures followed particular case it wouldnt confrontation all right now case i read record seems thats prosecutor attempting this page 50 joint appendix the analyst beginning testify second answer page 50 so we get sample mail et cetera the analyst beginning testify standard lab procedures defense attorney says your honor im going object whats done status quo  i take mean generally done i dont object done case  so defense attorney preventing  objecting prosecutions attempting discharge responsibility respect first three propositions testimony standard procedures insisting analyst provide testimony say violation confrontation clause namely testifying done particular case but  machine expelled piece paper said21 piece paper would  introduction piece paper contents piece paper would violation confrontation clause well  debate the purpose confrontation clause allow crossexamination how going crossexamine machine but things could potentially proven indirect evidence establishing standard procedures asking jury infer standard procedures followed case they might  might believe might they might make inference might but case didnt defendant actually testify drunk time  time blood extracted he took stand testified accident went woods came upon people drinking vodka drank drank   gallon vodka together went back scene blood tested isnt correct but state cant the state cant immunize people testifying you could subpoenaed caylor couldnt you could asked continuance  subpoena brought testify its question take step right how answer practical situation caylor particular run dozens day day memory fact particular test so  knows process operates doesnt remember particular one   could elicited crossexamination couldnt supervisor wasnt case tests unusual particular jurisdiction well i assume even doesnt remember testimony worthless prosecution he  prosecution bring high qualifications testify it  always way i i way time i dont remember particular incident all persuasive jury cant thank mr fisher general king not oath though thats difference do rules criminal  rules criminal procedure new mexico say prima facie evidence well depends course i mean right look evidence presumably  far advance trial whatever get new  new technician would put trial thank counsel thank counsel the case submitted,1039.0,1694,26,mr chief justice may please court as court said michigan v bryant police interrogation resembles ex parte examination primary purpose interrogation create quote outofcourt substitute trial testimony end quote a public record prepared police officer product structured interrogation it neither ex parte examination no your honor i dont believe thats it point your honor your honor point i making case document report talking public record differentiates affidavit melendezdiaz case your honor i understand ill answer question regard expectation certification affidavit its position theyre exactly several there distinguishing  distinguishing features significant affidavit melendezdiaz report case for one affidavit melendezdiaz prepared pursuant statute massachusetts called preparation affidavit lab point time actual test done used specifically incourt statement replace live incourt testimony affiant in case report public record record kept contemporaneously analyst lab case the21 single data point taken raw data machine recorded standard document thats provided no your honor i believe  that statement planned used trial your honor i think key look purpose analyst preparing report public employee carrying court said copying information machine onto report and thats significantly different amount analysis done   witness thats correct your honor in  case certification doesnt necessarily make report testimonial there  several examples  cases  evidence introduced court  certifications for instance may necessary public records custodian provide copy birth certificate  trial case custodian always certification says i certify that correct regard birth  birth certificate your honor your honor  case this  case sample sent lab tested but i think made clear michigan v bryant  might variety purposes analyzed order decide whether statement testimonial in case purpose  lab analyst significantly different purpose police officer requested analysis the lab analyst living  public duty the lab case  operated state department health scientific lab division  variety different kinds analysis and  analyst test wouldnt necessarily purpose  creating statement document as matter fact analyst would likely driven desire scientist yes your honor this lab also tests particular case gas chromatograph analyses blood alcohol test office medical examiner  new mexico law interestingly enough  defendant also ask test they would use form ask test so analysis might done defendant well state yes your honor they work new mexico department health no your honor could as matter fact  separation operation department health lab police even extends point physical separation police officers allowed lab area  no your honor record indicates  mr caylor available court leave without pay uhhuh we dont know your honor your honor i  i think defense would like know answer question no your honor in case thats  thats case i   case came little bit unusual circumstance sides negotiating plea agreement  plea agreement successful defendant asked trial expedited moved quickly trial so defendant didnt much discovery i think would normally case like your honor i think key would look  qualities declarant deciding whether statement testimonial and  court makes determination whether testimonial wouldnt  even would like ask questions wouldnt opportunity ask questions in case factually might also mr caylor unpaid leave run regular leave time decided we  would speculation your honor i think thats  important public records case one assumptions courts made hundreds years regard fact  duty person whos taking information  observe regular manner record regular manner thats important yes your honor your honor i dont believe that purpose form 705 could used it common purpose form form lab uses every circumstance and indeed i said new mexico law defendant ask second test they done its done states expense they done laboratory want but report done state lab theyre entitled done would utilize form not necessarily your honor i  i actually dont know answer specifically except form  look joint appendix  information part a  indicates police officer  sent test lab theres nurse case they  i think information would form whether defendant submitted whether  whether prosecution submitted your honor if look form your honor would information  today arguing analyst wouldnt know police submitted form but arms length request court addressed recent case michigan v bryant i believe  question whether interrogation one key questions whether interrogation this clearly look like case interrogation police it request standard form  sent and purpose test appears michigan v bryant would even apply cases theres police interrogation your honor analysis would somewhat different thats point your honor  appears make difference regard michigan v bryant new us well relevance your honor i think since interrogation  look i think court set look nature evidence make determination whether evidence thats presented merely substitute live incourt testimony and back difference affidavit melendezdiaz report case report even mr caylor trial stand would necessary report well i think justice ginsburg raised point six months examination done crossexamine analyst ask remember result six months ago one test hundred ran remember without looking report the report best evidence case prove point made thats correct your honor thats analysis whether testimonial important analysis  reasoning court hearsay exceptions excited utterances case public record would look whether evidence best evidence support truthfinding purpose trial thats  thats analysis least your honor and arguing case difference mr caylor transferring the21 data machine piece paper would took photograph instance machine data procedurally case your honor  trial district court level occurred courts opinion melendezdiaz and i think point time would normal behavior  state present raw data well in case mr razatos yes your honor not using testimony sense talking testimony i mean might want  well want evidence different cases  necessary submit judgment felony instance show person later trial felon  felon possession firearm would certification court clerk would say i certify copy document im submitting court true copy  thats also testimonial  purposes confrontation clause i dont believe thats certainly concern your honor i  look document six seven people certifications  dire  different statements document there three certifications theres one  woman takes samples lab says received samples theres one mr caylor theres one  reviewing analyst reviews i gather  petitioner challenging  one certification   mr caylor it and document im aware contested often your honor i  form i think one things new mexico really helps the reason court submitted form everything relating chain evidence  one document  indeed lot statements really help yes your honor i think distinction case  analyst essentially party action the analyst works armslength transaction   police prosecutors hes part prosecution team  ive thinking your honor i believe states statutes  different ways presenting evidence your honor  understand   burden state  issue comes directly analysis relating confrontation clause i  new mexico instance one problems  labs centrally located albuquerque  case trial san juan county  witness drive 3 hours get courthouse so thats sort different new mexico say massachusetts something like and  even 10 minutes worth testimony might drive 6 hours take whole day lab so  problem  i dont think seminal issue your honor im aware state requires everyone chain custody appear  trial it indeed normally prosecutor regard chain custody determine  going appearing there none im aware your honor i  i dont  i havent no your honor i think thats point state law  hearsay law  analyzed whether statements admissible your honor i think hypothetical  say really shows line if  lab police lab analysis police  look lot like party  lawsuit certainly hearsay exceptions made clear even though observations  generally  public records generally allowed observations police officers and  your honor i think that depends  look purpose whose purpose  youre analyzing now first would assume purpose test applies case seems since michigan v bryant purpose test may apply kinds cases  theres police interrogation but  case purpose test applies  also appears  test requires  look purpose policeman  whos asking question look purpose declarant case purpose labs clearly  purpose  get sample good analysis  report analysis new mexicos case parties the analysis comes state lab goes prosecution also defendant your honor one problems new mexico would since  since court believed  that report  admissible second sample  tried submit would cumulative evidence probably would kept  rule new mexico case so mr razatos important purpose trial in new mexico still i believe witness  authenticate document bring document it might mr razatos case its rule your honor although one things pointed  state always keeps two samples defendant right statutorily new mexico  sample retested lab correct your honor yes im sorry your honor  hypothetical  state knew far enough ahead time  would able submit   analysts results could always  blood sample continues exist could always retest  another witness could depending court rules case might states required but point time  current jurisprudence  didnt appear state needed retest sample i think worry little bit  many people might indeed come court testify  state  burden state  sample twice case youre going lose one analysts i  i think that indeed put great burden state and no your honor i think analysis kind statement youre looking your honor determine whether statement thats  thats made thats proposed trial substitute live incourt testimony and regard ballistics know would looking little bit different set facts but case facts  gas chromatograph gave us printout said  level alcohol blood is21 grams per 100 milliliters mr caylor transferred form thats putting i  i think  proves point im talking ballistics analysis would analysis someone reach conclusion and that sets melendezdiaz apart case   analysis    declarant case and ballistics cases i think often would find now  ballistics case took photograph bullet wanted bring court say heres bullet looks like jury could make determination whether think that bullet appears that wouldnt covered confrontation clause and  may i answer question your honor in  case  machine able machine essentially giving best evidence yes i believe that would case,797.0,1103,61,i dont understand you mean long  hearsay nonpolice officers admitted without without confrontation theyre police officers i didnt think point certainly true im sorry could tell means why different affidavit its certified understanding dictionary meaning certification thats attestation truth statements contained therein thats common definition so im assuming equivalent affidavit so different melendezdiaz lab report tell can and prepared fun use trial so difference make whether statute requires taken used trial whether police send used trial use state what difference make im sorry hes simply looking number putting report hes certifying certain things hes certifying following certain steps evidence wasnt tampered hes certifying hes complied requirements new mexico law respect report hes copying number isnt difference two documents one prepared primarily purposes  lab report prosecution purposes birth certificate prepared its prepared mark birth person used many purposes besides trial correct so tell makes certificate primarily purpose use prosecution individual would tested blood  wasnt prosecute does testing except police who else test are lab analysts civil service employees are lab analysts civil service employees is way office prosecutors police could cause get promotions werent producing kind lab reports police prosecution might like this analyst fired i recall was fired placed administrative leave something on leave without pay and know leave without pay does defense know leave without pay could defense found crossexamination reason leave without pay  shown incompetent process firing i dont know whether thats true wouldnt important defense and didnt  didnt prosecution intentionally set way person would testify could crossexamined isnt sent substitute testify i dont know facts boy smells bad it really and even case mere possibility could case shows bring person want introduce testimony i agree whether testimonial depend upon whether theres skullduggery possibility skullduggery even machine  machine situations good reason saying testimonial that principal thrust brief isnt testimonial you said unsworn recognize certification youre trying equate business record public record you hurdle record created specific purpose it created provide evidence use criminal prosecution well well does analyst know whether hes asked one prosecution defendant oh would know difference right well information one would say police submitted one would say defendant submitted right so police submitted  person  test would know police submitted i assume why key question whether interrogation does confrontation clause apply confrontations to interrogations i mean  witness police ask questions blurts know jones statement get response interrogation it would different interrogation doesnt make difference that condition application  confrontation clause if interrogation factors mentioned michigan v bryant would relevant presumably since wasnt interrogation i dont see  relevance whatever well hed look report say gee i dont remember know i lot reports but prosecution direct would say well do and would say i always i always i always thing did case well i dont specifically remember case i always and thats testimony would go jury it would pretty persuasive not good remember so give data analyst trial if wasnt persuasive power lab certification didnt new expert look printout graph say says thats well dont introduce lab report  gives credence reliability result because hes certifying followed certain procedures certain things sample wasnt tampered is  youre looking testimony correct youre looking trial testimony bolster test you might want order show machine says x y z thats good stuff put so youre going to show blood put and many many people might handled might routine check box sealed get is understanding lose cases  case take court people the chain custody wasnt  wasnt contested is often contested my impression often contested yes reason i asked question i dont think normally contested its normally business record kind however i looking distinction future i dont see wouldnt contested unless theres distinction general i know state takes different view wouldnt arent number states  provide testimony technician require technician come  testify and knowledge serious problems defendants contesting chain custody simply thing required again im  im aware thats problem i think boogeyman are states  states require   prosecutor produce everyone handled something chain custody  laboratory criminal  know normal business are states require if could tell couple i what medical reports aimed particular known victim crime thus end trial for example graph graph nurse keeps statement nurse patients temperature day 986 whatever normally graph would introduced states wouldnt require  would say oh produce nurse you produce doctor medical records which course known keeper used criminal trial are states require are states require ordinary business records perhaps ordinary kind always statements somebody something particular day when business records happen kept knowledge theyll probably introduced trial states require man woman made business record come court well i  i dont think thats accurate response least include qualification justice breyer put question records kept knowledge would introduced  criminal trials i mean say records labs  lets assume theres  theres police lab  police testing blood those would business records lab certainly would introducible theyre business records if record made use prosecution surely  doesnt come business records exception else wouldnt today its independent lab police always send independent lab fact independent business makes profit stuff it knows going used trial that wouldnt admissible would even though perfectly normal business record counsel general general seem describing  case seemed rather particular objection new mexico analyst show razatos  travel however long said its question one employees time rather but  described simple thing put machine would get piece paper why didnt new mexico  additional sample could  would simple retest having witness come court dont arm additional test would controversy well lets say court holds confrontation clause requires presence actual analyst testify sample is anything law says that testimony suddenly excused need analyst theres another sample available defendant test thats rule but im saying analytically bear question whether sample thats introduced state requires  analyst present theyre unrelated that may  may show confrontation rule silly rule but doesnt   theres  assuming confrontation required excused presence another sample i  i dont follow substitute caylor picture know defendants blood everything else theres vial certain amount blood theres certain amount left cumulative caylors picture it defendants blood lab tested another analyst general i  i dont want eat  little remaining time i think answer yes does new mexico assert rule applicable ballistics testing why certainly but   think result would  could develop machine put bullet    thats fired gun murder bullet machine goes blah blah blah spits know 99 percent 999 percent match would okay sure thank counsel mr fisher 2 minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-12,9,-38.0,27.0

regardless no one word evidence indeed respect cope rlpl stipulation none  none contributions came either unions i dont recall whats number two  to influence votes no i would i would challenge tried influence votes i challenge made contributions campaigns well public  thats im talking yes that  periodicals sometimes announce candidates support urge members  of course thats  dues money used well i  mr justice white many people i distinguish political legislative well i call legislative activity it called political unions  no legislative youre legislative body yes oh yes oh political i havent questioned evidence used money political purposes i challenge contribute money campaigns there word evidence support but even mr justice black  we asked judge submit question oh yes no moved  on ground supported evidence all argument took place submitted before submitted court  argued judge  theres evidence i  yes cant find word evidence records support contribution campaign except long lists contributions cope rlpl  what im sorry yes 22 item 4 yes not  court isnt necessary two reasons none dues  dues fees came plaintiffs there evidence plaintiffs object candidates union supported supported whether contributions otherwise they paid one cent thats right havent  pardon yes thats right i say dont standing certain things happened one paid money but street court specifically  if court decided anything case certainly decided oh im asking overrule course action your honor even opinion even even partially dissenting opinion repeatedly stated objection must specific cause must notify union said  well spoke specific candidates  no well certainly repeatedly said particular candidate particular cause addition repeatedly said  but i   to  oh but specifically said object cause object  and  particular cause said  and also  you also said notify union cause object well havent notified particular cause particular candidate yes didnt say your honor and legislative activity thats right all if  couldnt engage political legislative activity your honors know im sure but havent given money thats right that would particular cause also must notify union even opinion mr justice black repeatedly said “of notified union” they notify  well  theory law i find difficult understand and argued speak  well  pardon no  thats right your  thats  thats right thats right mr justice black mr blakeney going make argument similar youre suggesting notified suing well isnt peculiar  no i thought  but  i find  i find difficult understand somebody  lets say needs  notify cause action so somebody doesnt cause action somebody else acquires cause action somebody else suing now thats theory  document jurisprudence i cant grasp i one minute left mr justice white i think  oh started five minutes late i six minutes left the merits course fully argued street case court divided five ways basically  well several propositions first government action all congress done repeal prohibition unionshop secondly say state law shall apply unionshop agreements railroad industry and thats   thats federal action now say superseding state law makes federal action therefore unions  getting unionshop agreement bound constitutional limitation i think thats wrong i think repealing law repealing prohibition clearly constitutional superseding state law essential interstate activities railroad industry unconstitutional and therefore shouldnt reach constitutional question reach constitutional questions i think act  conduct lawful there right plaintiffs constitutional right infringed i know mr justice black disagrees and mr  oh i certainly i think fully sound opinion five i think opinion justice frankfurter mr justice harlan concurred sound view expresses view i would expound rights infringed people prevented saying anything writing anything supporting opposing anything they ordered made say anything except indirect sense mr justice black referred opinion using money publicize certain ideas effect making say no i think i think your honor  well i think  one examples i gave street case federal government certainly takes tax money exacted uses money employ inaudible various states preached faiths well suggestion made no yes case make democrat i would object i dont think i would constitutional right the suggestion seriously made federal government financed presidential campaigns that‘s right but  of course federal government didnt say join  join union well union successful negotiating   unionshop agreement doesnt even  doesnt yet so  and case but federal government except sense federal government repealed prohibition and i would submit mr justice white didnt preempt i would suggest state laws couldnt  it‘s held preempted many words held well federal contract except  no fede   federal law effect contract put certain limitations the limitations controlled thats right i would suggest state law couldnt prevent anyway would interfere interstate commerce unionshop agreement say southern railroad subways 13 states legal states illegal others but supremacy clause constitution article constitution when congress exercises power specifically conferred constitution cannot acting unconstitutionally thats right com  common federal legislation subject common it show yet  three it  silly situation the injunction still effect six put bond three always members one retired one accepted position subject unionshop but injunction six three  members along i could stop mr justice goldberg far remedy concerned i would want court stop i want court say street case people proven cause action  reasons first haven‘t proven cause action secondly even remedy wrong remedy that proviso youre talking provided however today unions completely

district court middle district north carolina in 1963 united states filed civil complaint section 1 sherman act alleging least since 1955 defendant companies engaged business selling corrugated containers southeastern united states unlawfully combined exchange among information prices charge quoted “specific customers” purpose effect restricting price competition the case submitted district court decision basis proposed findings many agreed well basis extensive depositions taken plaintiff various offices defendant exhibits introduced parties the united states asserted evidence defendants course conduct eight year period compelled conclusion combination existed whereby defendants finished one another upon request information recent prize current quotes member group offering specific customer the united states also asserted facts case combination unlawful purpose necessary effect restricting prize competition the district court handed decision august 31 1967 it dismissed governments complaint prejudice accordingly appealed court in brief district court concluded combination furnishing specific prize information proven it found even combination unlawful since agreement among defendants use exchange price information maintain prices minimize price reductions we believe district court wrong matter law finding combination existed also applied erroneous legal standard question legality combination they agreed upon facts described market corrugated container industry southeastern part united states 100 million worth business year there 10000 purchasers corrugated containers region the group 18 defendants case account 90 shipments as defendants brief points four largest defendants account 45 business it also fact six largest defendants account almost 60 business the number sellers interested given purchase also limited considerations geographic proximity buyer sellers plant suitability sellers equipment attractiveness order particular product mixed manufactured the business essentially accustomed order one purchaser indicating particular specifications box requirements the buyers carry inventories must buy immediate needs price consideration determines buyer gives business since quality differences among products offered sellers box made particular specification identical sellers box the industry throughout period characterized chronic overcapacity the court found defendant considered necessary ascertain defendant competitor recent price specific customer ascertain accuracy customers report another competitors price information usually requested competitor supplying customer the court also found defendant request information recent price specific customer received information usually furnished accurate after receipt information company free wished although findings show say finding 28th “in majority instances recipient quoted charged substantially price price given competitor response request” this interchange engaged throughout eight year period except brief periods defendants went one witness put air in cases defendants would neither give request price information does evidence show mr zimmerman uniformity prices throughout industry no mr justice harlan i think would enable clarify case about for one thing case express agreement combination revealed persistent course conduct secondly claim specific price fixing example government charged electrical price conspiracy cases submitting bids custommade equipment manufactures accused conspiring would bid price we claiming combination meliorates bigger price competition inhibits breaks to express distinction conduct though electrical equipment manufacturers submitting competing bids public utilities custommade machine agreed among order alleviate perils inadvertent price cuts anytime perspective seller piece business uncertain competitor bidding information would usually accurately supplied competitor upon request favor would returned future point this case seeks outlaw availability price information the trade association case supplied members monthly price configures would weekly analyze price trend information computed defendant challenged government published pricing manuals existed challenged government the defendants available cost information wrong record prior pricing findings indicated prior pricing customer tended carried forward unless significant cost changes unless market conditions altered purchasers could reveal competing bidders thought improved competition bids received hence a case challenges illegal acquisition information needed intelligent marketing initiative decisions its case claims defendants combination become precise detailed knowledgeable specific plans precision inhibits price competition conclusion verified case uncontroverted deposition evidence parties information exchange regarded assurance unnecessary price cuts finally mr justice harlan claim agreement froze prices this industry according findings throughout period question characterized overcapacity a condition ordinarily makes vigorous price competition works adjust capacity demand the fact circumstances prices varied business shifted significant uncontroverted fact despite chronic overcapacity new entrance attracted market indication market competition job balancing capacity demand my task persuade course conduct eightyear period evidence combination combination illegal because i read defendants brief showing much heart proposition combination exist yes yes yes fact extensive new entry despite fact chronic overcapacity indicates something wrong pricing if competitive pricing typically overcapacity would lead depression profit less attractiveness new entrance business judgment fact entry despite chronic overcapacity suggest something isnt working the sort conspiracy promotes competition i beg pardon the sort conspiracy promotes competition oh competition mr justice harlan intended allocate resources properly its intended people make informed decisions leave industry build new capacity thats committed fact get distortion i suggest competition working mr justice fortas i point argument district court stated combination existed unlawful it appear thank critical question whether defendants understanding use exchange price information inhibit competition the court found party made individual decision pricing receiving information decided agreement could inferred that therefore refuse consider significance uncontroverted evidence court described showing defendants felt price information needed maintain prices minimize price competition might otherwise exist and point mr justice fortas clam addition information exchange needed agreement use information the proposition advanced court group sellers account far dominant share market combined meet call one another substantial doubt member group may bidding particular piece business motivated combination concern failure complete precise information could lead price cutting even though party walks away meeting nominal freedom charge pleases necessary effect allaying doubts resolving uncertainties context mitigate price competition of course agreement specific prices arrangement would blatantly criminally unlawful but circumstances agreement necessary unless regarded noble doctrine i refer courts decision american column 257 us 399 court information exchange agreement noted absence agreement pricing there occasional meetings exchanges telephone oral content yes there occasional meetings  doesnt make difference whether meet whether meet telephone yes yes right communication were talking course conduct terms exchange information simply course conduct terms telephone calls occasional meetings i suppose happened trade association meetings ended this course conduct typify industry eight year period covered compliant apparently preceded complaint in telephone yeah no its complicated a competitor would ask competitor price x supplying no it includes  two types price information generally supplied the last quoted price andor current quote varied competitor competitor point information requested readily understood indicating current price certainly current quote indicates current price the last sale quote industry good indication current price finding persistency prior prices if company supplying customer given price typically barring certain changes industry would requote price so information exchanged meaningful parties asking well yes the 1940 consent decree permissive decree 1940 consent decree spoke past prices respect i think went beyond section 3 1940 consent decree eight  i believe eight defendants gave recent price rather current quote but i indicate recent price readily translatable course decree didnt permit simply indicated limitations yes as court points consent decree repeal antitrust laws section 3 simply indicates limitations decree well limited  designed limit trade association activities permitted maple flooring indeed thats they exchanged information maple flooring permitted association  yes exchange information pass close transactions yes its right information in case defendants explicit evidence gave current quotes purchaser and case past close quotes practice industry could readily assumed give good indication next quote would now i think court failed look uncontroverted deposition evidence misconceives teachings prior cases but prior cases dont say need additional agreement prior cases say additional agreement missing link “american column” missing link absence agreement use price supplied disposition man follow intelligent competitors they hear disposition make money possible system reports makes discovery price reductions inevitable immediate illustrate uncontroverted deposition evidenced indicated id like refer page 32 brief following colloquy question were ever requested information competitors answer yes sir question what would occasions answer we would give information mr bernstein if im selling box dollar i dont give information got guess price i dont want guessing 68 cents dollar price if going cut i would rather cut penny 99 dont make look like idiot thats dixie container gives prices other officials testify exchange information presented  prevented destructive price competition avoided necessity pricing low willing go the district court erroneously insisted agreement ignored evidence but even didnt evidence think necessary effect information requested times uncertainty members irrelatively small group sellers six almost 60 business under circumstances self interest would dictate minimization rigors price competition buyers demand fixed we think situation long pricing clearly visible one another long uncertainty avoided would pay anyone substantially cut prices since others could know match cut share business would remain lower profit the individual self interest participant could relied upon mitigate competition once combination exchange information effect unpredictably important evidence showed court found majority instances recipient information fact quoted substantially price received the district court discusses fact information exchange purpose enabling informed marketing decisions but court treats informed decision making undiscriminating reverence linseed oil american column revealed dangers specificity current prices the point information exchange occasions would reason defendants would slightly dark low would bid these occasions buyers determine self interest educate bidders precise state competition on occasions combination competitors would consulted cost extensive general price information available submitted price warranted profit defendants argue without information may bid high but good idea level prices bid high buyer would probably tell fact court found many buyers gave high bidders second chance meet lower price its buyers interest silent induce high price hes interested inducing low prices indeed want specific information serious risk existed uninformed seller would bid high one wonders competitor assisted colleague avoid mistake very simply mr justice fortas could exchange trade association information past pricing behavior  at  every ten days would compute prices previously average prices breakdown according region breakdown according type box yes i distinguish prices individual customer secondly could receive buyers information competitors selling buyer wanted give we objection thirdly could publish world price lists we objection price list general people discount price list specific cases its crawl one another agree upon exchange information specific price specific customer well yes were charging combination exchange information agreement exchange information yes well one deduce agreement combination  we charging combination language compliant combination  agreement exchange prices thats language  understanding and current right current either current quotes current last sale transactions context particular industry good indication seller gave information would next charge now argue buyer would ordinarily act self interest remaining silent cosellers bid high think court recognized extensive specific information current prices available relatively small group sellers buying market resolve mitigation competition the agreement combination understanding evidence course conduct eight years understood sellers desire avoid possibility opponent kept dark may comment lower price i note explicit testimony reveal i referred earlier courts finding cases fact upon receiving information recipient quoted price price furnished id like turn moment question whether combination the court seem think could regarded unilateral conduct theater enterprises dealing unilateral conduct refusal deal there two parties request answer furthermore district court referred implied understanding giving information one gets right request information indeed i read appellees brief page 13 concede hence conduct bilateral joint interdependent one simply doesnt without reliance others this evidence fact company went air went air ways it didnt continue furnishing information furnished requested information the district court also mislead fact request varied frequency information supplied different forms defendants retain freedom stop furnishing information the variations frequency merely met agreement worked namely occasions uncertainty where buyer wasnt talking wasnt accurate the different forms information i try explain mr justice fortas make much difference manuals existed practices trade information readily translatable cant assume parties engaged useless exchange stale information finally fact company maintain freedom furnish information another way stating pertain right depart go air the fact usually furnish information rather always furnish information mean course conduct usual conduct eight year period evidenced enough combination even explicitly conceived conspiracy operate perfection thank yes were relying mr justice stewart  no i saying confirms  arguing necessary effect inhibit  right defendants  to expected overcapacity to expected overcapacity point adjustment isnt made properly you establish restraint trade type case assume necessary effect  look purpose accept governments view avoid unnecessary price cutting inadvertent price cutting due ignorance buyer getting they therefore enter combination accept view the combination provides precise information avoids uncertainty we argue circumstances necessary effect ameliorate end price competition there many cases buyer would reveal price would competition there ample price information parties economic forces worked would working point working evidenced think though im relying fact chronic overcapacity entry because youre deprived sellers agree another get price buyer doesnt  deprive buyer situation probably needs bargaining namely silence thats difference im  i give answer mr seymour gave mr chief justice i know the information i president dixie company testified exchanged information people could trust some suggestion exchange may included everyone industry beyond i cannot say i dont think record disclosed well picked substantial companies number new entrance i dont know many companies would relatively new entrants i assume chose evidence the grand jury began inspired complaint costumer i suppose tract grand jury see involved no i think rule advancing mr justice fortas industry dominated relatively relatively small number sellers precise exchange current price information respect particular costumers necessarily inhibiting effect pricing  of ability small group visualize necessary consequence as effect as effect now case explicit proof purpose court ignored it seem think prove subsequent agreement dont american column makes clear dont well yes specific findings indicate information supplied recipient quoted price we even attempt go question happening prices seem us necessary soconyvacuum case the 18 mr justice black control 90 six 18 controls 60 seven 18 controls 70 18 whole control 90 well i would assume one infer didnt  perhaps werent interested helping competition indeed dont think maple flooring mr justice black interesting case actually 365 sellers representing 33 industry im sorry im speaking american column american column case court found illegally exchange information 365 sellers representing 33 industry maple flooring case information exchange past transactions without identity particular costumers neither  i think 22 i believe i think business exchange current specific price information maple flooring exchange indeed went didnt challenge thats trade association yes oh claim evidence price went we   i stated purpose exchange explicit information avoid unnecessary terms price cutting that order eliminate doubt price wouldnt price cutting they exchanged specific information prices seller quoting specific costumer arrangement combination,366.0,410,24,number 27 united states versus petitioner appellate versus container corporation america mr zimmerman mr zimmerman perhaps i missed point something said awhile ago  fact new entries  into business production rubber board boxes helps case say yes well maybe time mr zimmerman would good idea tell us precisely youre complaining i got saying youre complaining it makes feel pretty comfortable now dont  i thought i understanding case  wrong meetings people i thought  well maybe doesnt maybe  say mostly matter telephone  occasionally meetings and meetings hospices trade association pursuant agreement   and complaint meetings telephone conversations one competitor one member industry would tell another charged  a particular customer what mean what price did go beyond 1940 consent decree if decree didnt permit seven defendant  nine defendants well extent youre charging communication recent price then youre charging something expressly permitted consent decree particular defendant right i understand i say well consent decree something doesnt well point get  youre saying something beyond  maple flooring something beyond exchange information youre saying something beyond but  accord fine as going charge  im sorry interrupt would tell us information price do believe companies could lawfully exchange information could exchange complaining i dont understand mean is past prices in average prices can distinguish prices individual customers inside port i thought said  werent charging agreement i thought said deduce course conduct rather  i understand charging agreement course conduct and   object prices prices individual customers individualized transaction and current instead say ten days old mr zirmann as i understood earlier argument took position history production industry history new entries somehow help establish case restraint trade why dont is restraints rate new entry production now history constantly lowered prices i dont quite understand  maybe bad  establish restraint trade well whats difference economically buyer reveals price another seller reveals price mr seymour i understood mr seymour exactly rely exploring dont practically thousand small inaudible im talking lawsuit well mr zimmerman may i take advantage ask whether agree government seeking per se rule that say per se violation antitrust laws proved combination among defendants exchange current price information individual costumers well without proof  the effect alright proof  dont claim got proof record specific effect price market this inaudible  do submit inaudible  except rule inaudible inaudible inaudile inaudible yeah alright do inaudible mean day day inaudible you said something  inaudible,1596.0,1942,8,may please court let minutes try summarize situation i see result mr zimmermans argument this case filing  respondents filed common brief case question common common denominator defendants time time couldnt get information records didnt trust information got buyer would call another manufacturer ask last price done telephone universal practice challenged case government says fact alone speculation people would cut prices anymore establish combination violation law now  meetings counsel talked your honors find smaller trait gossip meetings involving three four defendants challenged illegal part practice they thrown color practice telephoning practice i referred now mr zimmerman said telephoned fellow got information nominally free go business its stipulated found every one prices fixed priced  fixed individual judgment seller business judgment alone he nominally free free exercised freedom theres word proof case restraint coercion now come recess precise manner competition and fact wholesale price cutting industry the prices went prices vary people taking away customers time people nominally free free thats heart now government really challenging the government really challenging maple flooring decision guys challenging saying theres exchange price information theres price information furnished word exchange accurate one wasnt exchange companies sometimes go another company gather information sense exchange what theyre really saying practice one disapproved specifically disapproved consent decree books 28 years everybody relied upon practice per se unlawful court declare case tried stipulation findings largely agreed findings werent agreed based upon documents stipulation and government coming asking court somehow review ordinary findings district court renegotiate stipulation though i submit your honors look stipulation findings youll find conclusion district court reach inescapable record now case case supplying price information kind agreement prices kind stabilizing prices kind uniform prices none present let bring case give court trial court economic pieces court insisted white motors others essential expand group per se violations this proper case expansion so thats summary position i  say addition lunch recess this practice followed 18 defendants case those existence said time consent decree successors large small regarded vital operation know price alternatives buyers thats stipulated thats agreed agreed findings this vital information stipulated company company needed information order compete this highly competitive business your honors see charge of course otherwise youre asked fire cannon without knowing target and i submit idea great economy built balancing demand supply position cant grow shouldnt grow kind fantastic approach problem may please court perhaps little nature industry i think ive said case challenges trade practice goes back least 1940 consent decree enjoined dissemination information best transactions entered there 18 51 companies southeastern part united states involved case the number companies number plants grown business customers grown enormous increase furniture business southeast thats one main purposes use containers the containers used ship furniture fruit cigarettes things theyre made specifications anyone companies make theres published market there  published price list therefore order get information enable company compete get somewhere court found  stipulated vital information buyers alternatives elsewhere usual method getting information  seller sell purchaser look records ask potential customer buying usually customer supplied information obviously advantage and occasionally usually according findings doubt information supplied customers practice telephoning getting information competitors but information obtained competitors findings indicate majority cases new potential supplier would bid amount understood bid competitors couldnt get business way cut price cut price old supplier would cut price happened time and findings indicate price competition rife highly competitive business practice price cutting went time im going show affirmative evidence ill tell affirmative evidence i get as i said  yes sir yes yes yes i cant answer i cant answer i reason doubt i dont know whether case brought charging 18 nobody ever inquired others i assume industry practice character probably followed everybody the consent decree relied everybody probably practice followed anybody i cant answer your honors specifically i said recess case submitted largely stipulated facts i think important realized upon stipulations agreed findings court largely based judgment mr louis bronstein handled case government lower court handled various statesmens like fashion he able tough adversary the court urged parties try get together stipulations instead taking courts time lot miscellaneous testimony exhibits mr bronstein deposed 34 representatives defendants proceeded stipulation table months stipulations record arrived i submit occasion looking little fragments deposition mr zimmerman one reference morning saying “well look government stipulated facts basic facts broad sweep facts i submit theres occasion court to revert depositions find depositions testimony 34 witnesses say one thing say another total this stipulation arrived at” and find little fragment little fragment support almost anything cant find show agreement price anybody constrained price charge didnt full freedom action i submit key well i doubt would pointed evidence barely need  mr zimmerman i understood said assume effects establish restraint thats governments case they assume without proof effect upon competition upon assumption say combination restraint trade the trouble theres proof matter assumption now fact  factor stipulation one thing i think significant the stipulations arrived government grand jury investigation result indictment called many witnesses gotten thousands documents supply defendants supplied list 10000 costumers apparently found costumer complained practice costumer ever called theres testimony stipulation showing costumer would testify subject i submit case proper one court go behind stipulations parties made different stipulations yes your honor look volume one  well agreed findings begin page 55 run 150 pages  those findings  where indication margin whether agreed agreed agreed findings basis trial courts findings agreed findings turn based upon underlying stipulation also record several stipulations yes where  your honor look agreed set findings see matters underlined where parties agree cases court basing conclusion stipulation documents record made independent findings critical findings dispositive findings stem stipulation agreement i think now  your honors look sweep agreed findings sweep practice price competition need information used youll see one thing i ought mention stage if supplier supplied costumer could find price course looking records price charged now one always adhere price couldnt rely fact another supplier would adhere price also stipulated changes cost changes supply changes specifications prices would adhered so cannot take price charged still charge  charge after costumer records supplier source supplier would ask costumer costumer would supply information sometimes information supplier doubted usually supplied information now important part didnt make slightest difference information obtained seller got information behaved he behaved exactly way seeking business whether got information records costumer competitor therefore say alleged defects stem exchange price information seems to without foundation now im going push say weve said brief  i think governments statement questions really rather elides fact much record stipulated basis rather fragments i said recess really common denominator practice challenged practice getting information telephone supplying due course asked wholly different transaction mr zimmerman said morning cases people gave past transaction information current code information now clear findings part defendants ever supplied code information case tried assumption common denominator information thing bound defendants together therefore i submit theres occasion explore separately cases quotation information supplied if made difference court would dispose case dismissing others government trying trying hold defendants together exchange information past transactions the fact defendants might interpreted phrase differently i think affect basic legal position now question combination i wont take real time i must say cases dont clarify entirely combination conspiracy agreement here happened supplier would call another supplier ask information knowing due course supplier might expect courtesy reciprocated connection transaction connection wholly different transaction thats way consensual basis whatever  whatever want call each supplier sometime asked matter reciprocal courtesy time supplied information sometimes request sometimes request sort situation reciprocal commercial courtesy work now government says thats enough make combination it seems to fit existing authorities subject isnt vital combination combination restrain trade result restraining degree price supplier would get product it neither coerce restrained however break if say combination combination restraint trade my view district court quite right record concluding sort like mutual courtesies cannot regarded combination expect give yes i think small suppliers group no nothing kind its absolutely neutral subject well may i time ask your honors want look charter two look volume three contains significant information the government put proof course price history defendants confronted kind record best charts volume three show now first chart volume three shows prices everything else going prices containers coming practice result one would expect kind price conspiracy price fixing arrangement however tenuous the next group charts shows prices varied defendants plants shows absolutely uniformity price defendants within plants the next group charts significant group begins middle begins page 21 shows business gained lost defendants shows page 22 example columns companies every year gain business lost business competitors and example chart page 22 container corporation plant year 1960 business third  third costumers people done business year third people didnt business year following now found stipulated generally speaking costumers change suppliers got cut price therefore reasonable infer changes results price competition industry fact widespread price cutting now beyond next group charts shows price went almost  almost like seismograph convulsion prices went like companies plants difficulty getting five lines single chart rather grouped geographically plants various competitors your honors see look price place places plants defendants and going theres another series charts stored back volume shows great variation socalled manuals now company manual views compute price although rarely ever published manual departed shown usually manual so nobody knew anybody elses manual could surely compute price and finally theres another group charts part volume show departure board prices another possible way computing price i think thats  i think thats perfectly evident what theyre saying entitled bar access knowledge among competitors must compete ignorance say effect might somehow chill price competition when theres proof proof active kind price competition destructive kind takes costumers away large numbers year year view exactly  yes sir that concession  well  i think governments position lower court charge exchange “a price information” would case they went beyond charge effective price information didnt prove effect they relied effect said natural effect exchange i think court saying really combination restraints trade combination didnt show restraint trade and say one agreement two agreements doesnt make much difference the fact prove restraint record shows contrary let push rapidly touch couple points the government relies cases decided maple flooring american column linseed oil sugar institute case decided maple flooring says arrangement combination invalid cases now i wont take your honors time try describe cases your honors recall tight explicit arrangements every case information prices supplied per leasing price structure in column case prices went 300 result arrangement in case stabilized there fines forfeitures linseed oil case departure theres nothing kind maple flooring i submit lays principle knowledge invokes self interest sellers lets sellers use knowledge compete way suits situation situation clearly permits the kind information supplied recognized consent decree made largely reliance maple flooring case friend says “well maple flooring didnt information particular costumers” but cement institute case cement institute case information supplied particular costumers fact case practice order cement lot different suppliers order get lower price even werent going use kind commercial fraud information could exchanged i dont say  mr seymour yes sir what essence charge case led consent decree well broad  broad price fixing charge included references earlier trade association one involved one involved charged injunction provisions consent decree bar kind trade association activity involved earlier case but exempt exchange dissemination information past transactions stipulated found every defendant relied upon provisions consent decree business way and i submit course consent decree binding your honors precedent fact government recognized long long time practice pernicious effects alleged practice elsewhere pernicious effects your honors asked extend area first day violation ought approved ought assumed basis speculation,205.0,247,13,that would apply everything apply economy wouldnt mr seymour need price information competitors  mr seymour youre making  those lawsuit  understand inaudible now arrangement open inaudible but participate  mr seymour i suppose price uniformity price stability industry effect exchange price information would evidence combination conventional antitrust  and could  could relied evidence now government admits theres i understand theres indication price stability what say i get would vigorous competition exchange information understanding theory mr seymour i understand mr zimmerman say addition stipulation words agreement upon many findings fact well i notice page 183 326 findings fact agreed finding i see but district court district court makes independent findings mr seymour  is anything pro con record small suppliers group no i mean  denied information anything one way mr seymour anything record price history industry is tendency prices uniform cluster im beginning think perhaps government seeking perceived rule respect price fixing respect “combination” exchange current prices information mr seymour page 567 opinion district court says plaintiff conceives i think thats united states conceives part complaint defendants agreed obtain price information would case i take youre saying government taking entirely different position well court says goes says district court says plaintiff therefore additional burden showing inferred agreement namely exchange price information court infer agreement use exchange price information mr zimmerman go next case i would like ask question i asked mr seymour do take people charged ones engaged practices practice open alternate building

consolidated cases writ certiorari united states court appeals district columbia circuit the basic question presented whether federal power commission barred section 441 tax reform act 1969 permitting company subject jurisdiction seize flowing company’s customers form lower rates the benefits derived use accelerated depreciation certain property if tax reform act action question arises whether commission’s action case improper before i discuss facts case introduction appropriate it wrong established federal income taxes includable expense cost service method used federal power commission ratemaking accelerated tax depreciation first authorized 1954 adoption section 167 internal revenue code under accelerated tax depreciation deductions particular asset relatively high early years relatively low later years compared would straightline tax depreciation used when matter first came commission ratemaking context commission determined use accelerated tax depreciation simply resulted tax deferral accordingly commission decided ratemaking purposes company’s taxes normalized  that’s right historically back 1956 the commission decided  ratemaking purposes tax normalized normalized means calculated company used straightline tax depreciation the difference taxes actually paid higher normalized taxes claimed cost service required placed special tax reserve account payment future taxes several years later commission alabamatennessee case reconsidered matter it concluded use accelerated tax depreciation resulted permanent tax savings this conclusion squarely based commission’s finding natural gas industry would continue expand rapidly foreseeable future assumption certainly true today the commission noted expanding company uses accelerated tax depreciation sufficient tax depreciation deductions new property available set declining tax depreciation deductions property the commission ordered natural gas companies using accelerated depreciation tax purposes to also use accelerated tax depreciation ratemaking purposes in way benefits accelerated tax depreciation would flowed company’s customers it’s important note commission’s normalization order flowthrough order upheld various courts appeals within commission’s discretion other regulatory agencies sharply divided issue in short matter technical one turns large part analysis particular facts pertaining give industry precisely type question falls within broad discretion regulatory agencies ratemaking this brings us section 441 tax reform act 1969 as legislative history act makes clear congress concerned lost revenues government resulting use accelerated tax depreciation public utilities rather prohibit use accelerated tax depreciation together congress chose simply bar future shifts faster methods depreciation with respect existing pre1970 property statute permits use one straightline tax depreciation two accelerated depreciation normalization utility using accelerated depreciation act passed three accelerated depreciation “flowthrough” company using “flowthrough” act passed no doesn’t  i’m aware they focused practice there’s double revenue loss  accelerated tax depreciation flowthrough there’s first loss resulting increase deduction  and secondly there’s lower rates due flowthrough means there’s less revenues taxed utilities  less revenues coming taxed benefits passed lower rates lower rates consumer now similar rules apply new post 1969 property respect new property expands company’s capacity additional rule adopted under section 167 l 4 code regulated companies “flowthrough” given right elect “flowthrough” apply expansion property as legislative history statute indicates effect provision permit companies making election use straightline tax depreciation without obtain approval regulatory authority in order upheld court issue federal power commission announced general policy would permit companies making election use normalization expansion property i come case tax reform act enacted texas gas transmission corporation petitioner indicated commission pending rate proceeding would make election use “flowthrough” expansion property the company sought commission’s permission use  well said would use  sought permission use normalization expansion property well existing property it said commission give permission use normalization would straightline depreciation expansion property the commission granted commission respect expansion property existing property the commission found texas gas switch normalization expansion property tax depreciation property would longer available offset declining tax depreciation existing replacement property the reason would longer available normalization benefits use accelerated depreciation expansion property placed deferred tax reserve account may use pay future taxes expansion property the deferred tax reserve essence normalization part statutory definition normalization tax reform act section 167 l 3 g definition section act with expansion property picture commission concluded use accelerated tax depreciation existing replacement property would longer resolve permanent tax savings under circumstances commission held use normalization property texas gas would lead stable tax cost ratemaking purpose would public interest the court appeals reach ultimate merits commission’s order held section 441 tax reform act foreclose commission permitting switches flowthrough normalization it issue i turn there nothing face section 441 suggests regulatory agencies may permit shifts flowthrough normalization as i noted statute merely lists permissible methods tax depreciation way bar shifts slower faster methods depreciation under literal terms stature companies “flowthrough” qualify three methods depreciation straightline depreciation accelerated depreciation normalization accelerated depreciation flowthrough the election provision simply gives company right elect use “flowthrough” expansion property the legislative history statute confirms statute bar ships “flowthrough” normalization appropriate regulatory agency approval the house report initial version include election provision the house report describes effect bill three general rules the house report describes three general rules the third rule house report “flowthrough” use tax payer must continue use “flowthrough” unless appropriate regulatory agency permits change property respondents argue vigorously third general rule refer house report displaced election provision the election provision first added senate apply property later restricted conference apply expansion property it submission election provision affect regulatory agency’s authority permit companies abandon “flowthrough” all election provision give utilities absolute right without go agency first get “flowthrough” this provided house bill way agency could get “flowthrough” house bill get regulatory agency’s approval now quoted relevant excerpts senate report conference report brief pages 23 25 and submit reading reports clearly supports position in fact respondents studiously avoid direct confrontation pertinent provisions two reports submit pertinent indeed respondents also vigorously argue certain language house senate reports effect legislation would freeze existing depreciation practices supports construction statute the house report example noted requirement later companies revert immediately straightline depreciation would place regulated companies competitive disadvantage would result wide spread rate increases accordingly house committee determined “in general freeze current situation regarding methods depreciation” the short answer respondent’s contention freeze language freeze language appeared first house report largely copied senate but house bill everyone acknowledges three general rules “freeze” obviously subject three general rules i noted third rule explicitly acknowledges legislation permits abandonment “flowthrough” approval appropriate regulatory authority may please  mr chief justice may please court i agree  counsel government mr huntington issues case arise primarily tax reform act 1969 the question court  commission found that act required one result the court appeals found act required another result really question case two results conformity purpose intent congress enacting tax reform act 1969 specifically intent purpose congress enacting act bring drastic immediate change depreciation practices utilities country a change would result prompt substantial widespread rate increases the court appeals result reached court appeals intent congress the result court appeals allows utilities take normalize depreciation respect expansion property leaves rest property exactly way tax practices effect this precisely congress intended see phase act even clearly appears legislative history act first act specifically provides counsel pointed election respect post 1969 expansion property but let pause right point act narrowly defines post 1969 expansion property it property acquired 1969 replace existing property increases operating productive capacity utility now case pipeline industry means expansion property starting flat zero 1970 grow gas shortage mentioned counsel expansion property probably grow slowly so election respect expansion property little practical tax effect rate effect long time future if that’s what’s lax commission it’s stubby tail wag large dog the tax act also expressly provides retention “flowthrough” depreciation respect property companies using past it twice respect pre1969 respect  i mean pre1970 post 1969 properties specially provides companies “flowing through” may continue “flowthrough” the court appeals reached exactly result now legislative history makes clear congress intended nothing else i think im agreeing brothers side concerning reason passage act the utility commissions country trending toward “flowthrough” requiring utilities go “flowthrough” way minimize utility rates you made companies pay  charge rates basis paid taxes you didn’t give fictitious tax like normalization the thing wrong treasury’s point view mr huntington said also reduces taxes paid companies and committee found would soon result loss billion dollarsandahalf maybe 2 billion federal treasury what loss the solution proposed house freeze current tax situation  current depreciation practices right the trend us toward “flowthrough” freeze stop right proposed they propose reverse river freeze right permits change property or says right appropriate regulatory agency your honor might circumstances regulatory agency take utility “flowthrough” put kind depreciation “flowthrough” depreciation works  principle works utility expanding stable condition long plant expanding stable “flowthrough” proposition works if plant winding would appropriate regulatory commission take “flowthrough” so circumstances regulatory commission well im saying applies federal power commission applies regulatory voice overlap oh yes sir yes sir includes but federal power commission court appeals recognized might circumstances change “flowthrough” would justified i think that’s  reference as matter fact face act provision regulatory agency permitting change you don’t find act that’s comment part people working act but yes your honor but your honor congress two concerns equal value time one concerns stopped trend flowthrough the concern without creating widespread prompt substantial rate  utility rate increase now  voice overlap the commission power  permit change we believe discretion case your honor that’s right yes rule three seems say discretion  not circumstances state  must say must say piece legislative history must disregarded terms plain language act no your honor i don’t say i say that piece legislative history place proper fact situation fact situation then e reviewing discretion commission i thought voice overlap power question under circumstances case commission discretion yes your honor and said two bases first reading act secondly proposition federal power commission absolute legal duty allow cost service nothing actual taxes  real tax expense and say principle violated federal power commission case that’s commission wrong your honor im saying rule 3 course it’s wrong it’s law no sir thank mr justice stewart it doesn’t circumstances might proper utility commission move company “flowthrough”  your honor  i believe circumstances case  alright here’s  well alright what commission wants case may i say something i get definite want get but see course legislation passage legislation congress first chairman white commission came congress said we’d like everything put straightline depreciation the congress turned request reason addition one mentioned mr boland reason put everybody straightline would result prompt substantial widespread utility rate increases and congress want prompt rate increases come effect turned now mr justice white commission win case commission’s decision case reached almost exactly situation would reach chairman white’s suggestion the utilities would charge rates basis straightline depreciation pay taxes basis accelerated depreciation and right purposes would fact straightline depreciation it’s quite it’s almost chairman white suggested turned now they thought accomplished purpose without putting rate  law effect would cause rate increases utilities they said bill would forestall revenue loss continuation existing trends would make almost inevitable and would “in way exceptions require increase utility rates tax laws your honor i believe intent congress accomplish “freeze” accomplish way avoid rate increases i believe action commission “unfreezes” drastically revolutionizes utility practices way causes rate increases in words result reached commission precisely opposite result congress saw now let point bill got senate someone senate suggested let’s give pipelines utility power election change away  abolish “flowthrough” depreciation respect properties abolish “flowthrough” respect properties now happened would almost exactly situation act passed  i mean act construed commission the commission says little  election respect expansion property puts us position practical purposes got allow pipeline go normalizes properties we alternative that’s commission’s position case we force practicalities situation so commission saying election respect expansion properties tantamount practical purposes election respect properties this precisely senate proposed put act congress turned so twice matter considered twice congress turned the commission reached result congress turned let address reason i think commission discretion first  well  no alright let’s talk terms commission’s power the commission duty court said allow tax cost cost service greater actual taxes the court says there’s nothing tax reform act 1969 modifies commission’s duty natural gas act require regulated utilities companies texas gas set rates reflect actually expenditures respect property  set rates reflect actual expenditure now commission discretion grant utility tax allowance cost service it doesn’t power grant utility allowance cost service taxes paid in words power treat cost something fact cost that’s right your honor that law natural gas act court appeals held court held united us pipeline versus fpc tax case mr justice white familiar in case court said commission power duty limit cost service real expenses now case texas gas normalization little tag expansion property going increase depreciation decrease it’s depreciation one dime now ever it’s going increase income taxes respect depreciation one dime ever the effect put money texas gas’ pockets texas gas gets charge higher rate normalization respect little piece expansion property gets pocket difference and commission position saying texas gas gets increase revenues due  respect expansion property therefore order keep even order keep whole it’s got get increase revenues large scale respect 600 million worth depreciable rate base there increase texas gas’ taxes result it’s going normalize depreciation expansion property therefore say commission power give additional return additional amount cost service we say that accomplished precisely congress attempting avoid congress said let’s freeze situation avoid tax rate increases the effect commission’s decision unfreeze situation drastically change tax practices cost hundreds millions dollars utility rate increases throughout united states your honor illustration the whole concept im sure your honor knows panhandle case city chicago case the whole concept normalized depreciation works company expanding condition depreciable base least stable principle flowthrough depreciation new properties coming set old properties declining value principle works it would work pipeline gas shortage whatever winding activities and therefore corporate  tax utility particular pipeline caught winding condition depreciable property actually decreasing would applicable but let point one shred evidence case not shred evidence texas gas’ property going  going wind decrease as matter fact question normalization never even considered trial case texas gas didn’t ask it filed return nobody put evidence there’s shred evidence case effects normalization texas gas so say commission done  your honor i thought i given light i overstepped colleagues you given red light i going given white light i didn’t see i hope i haven’t overstepped colleagues’ time i supposed leave thank your honor i summarize saying that congress specific problem mind the problem avoid tax losses stemming flow toward “flowthrough” it two purposes mind one without causing utility rate increases the result reached commission case causes enormous utility rate increases country the result reached court appeals causes increases exactly coincides intent purpose congress thank i’d like talk first power issue i remarks say commission’s exercise discretion case when mr morrow conceded maybe certain circumstances commission could permit abandonment “flowthrough” respect existing property i think conceded point that precisely position it’s matter commission discretion third rule house provided it left type thing commission the thing election provision give companies absolute right without getting regulatory agency approval get “flowthrough” now language senate report pertinent senate added election provision and language report shows adding it mean displace third rule have presented argument court appeals rehearing voice overlap yes power yes i’m sure we argued court  have court appeals there’s specifically thought conference run around voice overlap the court appeals stressed certain language conference report i don’t think i go but come grips issue rather squarely brief think there’s total misreading conference report must rely senate report merely narrowing election existing property expansion property conference certainly mean negate general rule referred to house senate report i’d like to turn  assuming commission power properly exercised case now respondents briefs talk actual taxes doctrine actual taxes doctrine never thought never held preclude commission exercising discrimination treat liberalized tax depreciation ratemaking purposes it largely question whether taxes result  whether use liberalize depreciation results tax deferral tax savings now could consider texas gas property together would different case then would continue assuming texas gas continued expand would  would  would able use benefits expansion property respect old property but congress made segregation congress said “with respect expansion property get “flowthrough” go straightline get agencies approval go normalization” so congress segregated types properties so cannot consider tax benefits expansion property determining method accounting apply existing property ratemaking purposes the whole concept normalization take benefits put reserve account they available anything else they account pay future taxes respect property no it’s  it’s accounting thing cannot those funds available  well far  words company required maintain account sufficient size pay future taxes respect property the  far paying  when collected think it’s actual money sense collected  you collected  you collected somebody that’s right well ratemaking purpose amount deducted rate base essentially voice overlap  well i know it’s treated tax expense voice overlap for ratemaking purposes  treated expenses  taxes actually paid  as actually paid haven’t paid   haven’t paid that’s right but congress specifically said alright use method expansion property it congress made segregation therefore look existing property determining method use and say commission correct determining use “flowthrough” longer appropriate full discretion matter completely within commission’s discretion analyze facts make  so far within discussion commission doesn’t like say it it said i well it respect existing property longer sufficient deductions offset declining balances existing property year year tax depreciation deductions would decline therefore instead tax savings respect property merely tax deferral pass form lower rates would simply mean present customers paying tax expense getting tax benefit expense future customers would pay increase taxes thank you,245.0,313,20,we’ll hear arguments next 72486 488 federal power memphis light texas gas transmission memphis light consolidated mr huntington may proceed whenever you’re ready when say matter first came you’re talking historically particular proceeding may i ask couple questions record  legislative history show congress concern limited impact accelerated depreciation respect public utilities i lost point well that’s i want get of tax remedy – higher deduction there’s lower tax remedy i see there’s first  i see everything lower rates consumers what company use thank mr huntington mr boland what language page 83 friend discussing bit ago if taxpayers taking accelerated depreciation “flowing through” mission tax payer would continue unless fpc  well isn’t exactly tells us did seem suggest doubt regulatory agency would no doubt similarly means federal power voice overlap but change “flowthrough” would course beneficial point view congress’ concern time 1969 act would serve increase taxes because would change either normalization start straightline right but court appeals’ opinion isn’t  wasn’t freeze terms review discretion i read it simply said categorically commission couldn’t simply taking little different that reason rule 3 wrong what put another way doesn’t rule 3 apply face said well reviewing decision commission whether circumstances proper case is issue perhaps better tell us commission wanted case surely isn’t one thing say tax reform act wasn’t going cause rate increases another thing say terms prohibited commission action might permitted rate increase well gets us back discussion discretion power or  misspeak that depends section 441 either party you’re arguing in response mr justice white mind said circumstances would discretion commission without discretion yes no 10 minutes remaining something important we’ll flexible enlarge friends’ time accordingly needs mr solomon well say put particular account know actual deposit funds it’s accounting they’re funds if use accounting entries and ratemaking purposes would treated way depreciation service kind would treated thank you,1232.0,1566,5,mr chief justice may please court the fundamental error court case whether election provided senate addition third rule house representatives whether substitution a careful reading opinion rehearing showed court fell claim error the position respondents case it’s substitution supporting court our position it’s clear additional method provided taxpayer we think shown clear senate report connection we’ve set forth entire legislative history respect section 441 tax voice overlap what  congress concerned stimulated whole change it isn’t express terms it’s feeling congress concern whether regulatory agencies would permit change within discretion agency would permit shift well clearly established reports houses your honor concerned gradual shift trend “flowthrough” companies “flowthrough” the biggest telephone company straightline depreciation federal communications commission threatening impute “flowthrough” regulatory purposes tax consequences act would staggering they really loss tax revenues report shows intended really passing provisions liberalized depreciation 1954 code benefits passed consumer it intended give utilities working capital order invest new plant well suggestion made your honor chairman federal power commission chairman white report shows congress turning objection several agencies competitive situations would put utility competitive disadvantage they also concerned fact would mandatory would create widespread rate increases utilities yes your honor i think report clearly established they make pretty clear concerned specifically  but dilemma speak on one hand  well leaving discretion regulatory agencies individually well your honor some federal power commission position fairly clear that’s case legislative history shows state commissions equally divided “flowthrough” normalization and circumstances might change example we’re confronted natural gas industry court knows fully well got gas shortage louisiana power light case and one fundamental premises commission originally directed “flowthrough” alabamatennessee case they anticipated continued expansion gas industry recognition gas reserves less beyond year 2000 well short 1973 premise federal power commission anticipated falling waste time yet decision court would forever barred changing “flowthrough” notwithstanding change fundamental principle concept  basic premises federal power commission but clearly shown suggestion made make mandatory utility could use liberalized appreciation point forward turned might competitively and widespread rate increase it would automatic all utilities involved would increase rates now might unique situations like texas gas texas gas rate increase file requested within discretion federal power commission go straightline depreciation the tax consequences rate level consumers exactly normalization as matter fact commission’s decision little lower deduct reserve rate basely get lower rate no except one respect make comment intend preclude agency’s discretion deducting reserve normalization rate base no strict sentence rate basis plant invested utility whereas talking item costs service expense part cost service the tax expenses included cost service the item cost service directly relates rate base return i suppose depreciation depreciation also relates rate basis but got operating maintenance expenses got federal income taxes state taxes ad valorem taxes goes totality costofservice rate based but turn page 82 83 main brief set legislative history entire act look lower portion page 82 key whole decision court both house bill committee  senate report  what brief reading im reading page 82 main brief  white brief part appendix bottom last paragraph bottom senate report senate report making clear house bill committee amendments senate committee amendment they’re sponsoring provide case existing property following rules apply  following rules apply the third rule shown page 83 tax payer taking accelerated depreciation “flowthrough” customers benefits deferred taxes taxpayer would continue wherein except provide committee amendments discussed close unless appropriate regulatory agency permits change property is address inaudible yes what respondents would your honor right report they ignore they attempt make explanation happened language here firm clear language senate say identical except parenthetical third rule house court said house bill passed commission texas gas wouldn’t clearly justified done but senate report precisely provision present disregard it isn’t somehow election provided senate suppose expunge report but don’t see expunge it’s right black white now parenthetical might ask parenthetical refer the parenthetical refers fact see follow page 84 they’re referring one principal difference the committee amendments respects house provision differ one principal area the amendments permit election made within 180 days so seems perfectly obvious came house third rule agree third rule the court said law would’ve voice overlap did need consent commission third rule oh yes third rule need consent commission i know language oh yes sir yes sir well language would read are page 83 im page 82 82 well go 83 third rule top page 83 it’s right 173 now look last part says “unless appropriate regulatory agency permits change property” in words somebody “flowthrough” like texas gas would continue “flowthrough” third rule unless appropriate regulatory agency permits changes property and that’s exactly what’s happened federal power commission permitted change precisely language house again i reemphasize court said house language rule would  where language requires commission give consent at tailend third rule page 83 it says unless appropriate regulatory agency permits change property but wasn’t require give  oh no required discretion the whole argument court election submerge obliterate discretion federal power commission thereto clearly court decisions decide method tax depreciation use cost services rates and say language senate report house version survive election it’s separate thing it’s absolute right election it needs permission commission granted case submit properly my time thank mr chief justice members court there may confusion issues case there two issues case would put case united states first issue whether court appeals correct construing tax act precluding commission considering request texas gas and second issue whether assuming commission authority  continuing authority consider question whether considered problem there’re two issues they’ve put case united states accepted us it true one decided court parties proceeding suggesting decide second issue reach now i haven’t got enough time spend much time basic decision court but i want say one thing response justice white the court appeals believe situation left time senate report mr boland read commission would’ve precluded the court appeals decision based entire history happened specifically based upon limitation election conference the report speaks senate bill conference limit court appeals thought significant i think it’s significant look brief point i would really i limited time i like go exercise power assuming power now united states hasn’t said much they would like believe discretion end argument agency obviously great deal discretion general decide parameters ratemaking principles but decide “flowthrough” that’s worry but one thing complex tax law clear agency chooses

evidence substantial evidence certainly one weight saying industry changed company companies going growing companies and therefore factual situation change if posture came obviously unless commission’s determination clearly based record would difficult problem want reverse but problem way case comes on contrary commission assumed assumed found order 578 texas gas going continue grow and i citing page 110 record two lines three lines numeral 27 47 and here’s say said commission isn’t “while texas gas pre1970 properties may represent declining net investment the company undoubtedly adding entire rate base post1969 construction” they didn’t find gas supply shortage thing else changed situation met tax savings rather tax deferral what found commission right  pardon texas gas right keep portion tax savings ie increasing amount new expansion property that somehow converted situation tax saving tax deferral but submit nothing act nothing commission’s rule nothing common sense says company temporary use interest free loan means it’s use liberalize depreciation going become tax deferral rather tax saving it means unforeseen unexpected certainly found record future date there need

Mont,United States of America,5.0,4.0,0,1261.0,1371,14,mr chief justice may please court when congress uses plain ordinary words statute words read accordingly the language section 3624es tolling provision plain unambiguous the use phrase imprisoned connection conviction crime meaning derived language statute enabling legislation statutory provisions cases make clear meaning the manner section 3624e interpreted sixth circuit alters plain meaning statute by interchanging imprisonment official detention purpose meaning provision reaches beyond intent congress yes your honor the period conviction presently serving ohio  get benefit pretrial official detention yes in ohio happens defendant sentenced state judge required apportion pretrial official detention towards credit sentence it imprisonment it credit goes towards days person spend imprisonment in case mr mont received 300 days one cases 305 days case notwithstanding fact held detention second case thats correct yes your honor exactly point person official detention held seen either flight risk risk danger community when person imprisoned hand purpose imprisonment embodied section 33  3553 says four reasons imprisonment punishment retribution rehabilitation incapacitation those reasons  im sorry those reasons imprisonment markedly different official detention no your honor the person officially detained first year they given credit towards fiveyear sentence serve four five years four years imprisonment term actually serve no the person credited towards imprisonment the   sentence announced district court judge would sentence mandatory sentence scenario it would fiveyear sentence once person reaches custody jailer either bop local state jail entity grant credits 3585 directs bureau prisons grant custody credits those credits  the granting  he given credit period  credit term imprisonment official detention that correct and reason credited  reason credited official detention given credit sentence exactly that sentence imposed pretrial official detention punish pretrial official detention never intended and court stated us versus salerno pretrial detention regulatory penal so even person granted official detention time granted custody credits custody credits ism theyre term imprisonment theyre handled separately this  i trying say justice ginsburg when person sentenced  well take mr chief justices argument  fiveyear sentence person spent one year official detention prior custody prior sentencing year spent may given credit towards sentence it thing sentence  remaining  remainder sentence defendant serve so  that correct thats correct your honor if tie reading statute  assuming theres tie reading statute cannot separate imprisonment conviction connecting phrase connection   broad phrase limiting terms imprisoned says imprisoned important connotes present tense that connotes something thats happening right moment youre looking see  take snapshot time youre determining whether supervised release tolled snapshot  imprisonment contemplated statute yes your honor i understand youre saying and  perhaps would easier look official detention   established reasons granting credits and reason granting credit official detention  scenario used sixth circuit i look back see specific time district court state court judge apportioned official detention credit sentence so sixth circuit require looking back they use present tense    statute they looked back said whether  wait person sentenced so theres lot  theres lot uncertainty involved given moment  important take snapshot approach  given moment person may indeed detained theres guarantee person remains  official detention state courts regularly release defendants  rearrest reimprison and theres way district court looking violate someone supervised release know whether official detention snapshot point time going attributed thats correct your honor and indeed safeguard congress built statute supervised release statute 3583 that correct well point your honor that correct because conviction  no  yes actually  reading word conviction 3624e help conviction include  final judgment it  it connection  connection conviction term used 3624e 3624e deals convictions final sentences justice kavanaugh reason would use word conviction conviction meaning final judgment use word still  still period person held official detention prior  prior entry judgment and statute interpreted 3624 requiring conviction also includes judgment it say i  i get word conviction means final judgment  no doesnt say however using section 3624e indeed sections chapter 229  title  title 18 title   placed govern imprisonment it governs sentences it governs action takes place person adjudicated guilty imposed sentence there occasion section 3624 could conviction include judgment point imprisonment thats  portion statute uses in addition  this part argument raised addressed  sixth circuit the statutory  getting back conviction  lott versus united states 1961 lott defined conviction requiring judgment and  lott stated plea constitute conviction and theres never contradiction  contradiction lott indeed section 4  old parole statutes section 4241 define conviction specifically mean   defined conviction final judgment verdict  finding guilt plea include final judgment thats expunged your honor 3143 bail reform act particular section deals official detention plea  judgment conviction respect jury verdict and still  still eligible bond you still eligible released and concerns pretrial detention official detention its flight risk granted   standard proof increases 30  3143 you would prove clear convincing evidence flight risk that true your honor much difficult hurdle defendant  overcome basically prove case would overturned thats standard although  im articulating correctly  thats practical standard you prove youre going  know youre going found innocent  claim official detention   practical problems applying official detention imprisonment  state court judge imprisons somebody  alleged offense another defendant whos also supervised release charged another offense one held official detention person held official detention the question becomes person held official detention still ability supervised probation officer the answer yes but answer also yes person detention also supervised probation officer therefore purposes supervised release go even person held official pretrial detention granted panoply  benefits supervised releasee probation provides cannot met prison  defendant official detention also supervised release person report arrest report commitment report type  contact theyve law enforcement and many times happen official detention and indeed many local courts local jails ability programming counseling services available people official detention now government would believe theres  fact  sixth circuit would believe supervision occurring person official detention and thats simply case and majority times probation officer contact local authorities local jails contact  supervised releasee determine indeed theyre required report back court  let court know person theyre supervised release thats correct the  alter   degree  as   respect held custody correct it similar imprisoned  prison facility sentencing however ability person receive bond alters dynamic probation officer and indeed person charged offense state court theyre also supervised release usually represented counsel so  yes i  i answer what difference though person  prison serving sentence eligible whole host   training  review official detention period significantly different person bond also facing supervised release violation theyre represented counsel allowed talk events  reason theyre  indictment charged crime so  id like reserve remainder time thank the governments reading statute created ambiguity workable the conditions supervised  supervised release persons held continue official detention that true mr monts case in northern district ohio chief probation officer indicated supervision continues continuation probation officers duties stop moment person arrested those duties continue and also probation officers instructed allow courts information happens person held pretrial detention state courts oftentimes probation officers relationship local courts they  theyre understand concurrent case theres  here in case your honor probation officer initially contact state court first indicted marijuana case also contact mahoning county jail arrested june after time i dont believe additional contact that may different disturb affect  anticipation  judge handling supervised release case knowing whats going  releasee the judge would still like know probation officers would still inform whether  point probation officer would inform judge i cant contact and often i said previously contact limited person represented cant really participate lot backandforth communications somebody theyre adjudicated and addition justice alito question whether grounds  could revoke somebody based upon grounds violated supervised release detained and indeed reasons if person drugs local jail would new offense state law would also violation supervised release would public probation officers still responsibility now friend decided  stated  case  time person sentenced know whether official detention apportioned prison sentence but cant know unless backwardlooking analysis statute doesnt work thank you,581.0,788,27,well hear argument next morning case 178995 mont versus united states ms malone well course got ben  got benefit period actual sentence conviction i mean credited sentence right it treated part sentence if   i thought purposes pretrial detention security issues protecting community danger defendant may pose correct and im assuming argument that period safety period conviction credit credit purpose detention well suppose  im sorry no finish if look  suppose somebody sentenced five years prison  detention one year judge says im sentencing five years prison im giving credit year detained prior trial isnt person imprisoned  first year well suppose statute said upon conviction offense defendant shall sentenced five years imprisonment no discretion judge but person detention year does mean judge cannot credit person one year spent  official detention person wasnt imprisoned time what  cred  would say granting period connection i mean thats language statute i understand imprisoned argument connection conviction so hes given credit period connection conviction right but term imprisonment connection conviction its got connection conviction wouldnt  nothing credit the person prison hes liberty and given credit time sentence conviction i really dont follow seem saying imprisonment even though  court sentence treats it imprisonment conviction he imprisoned detention purposes safety conviction so youre back imprisoned and  colleagues saying two textual clues one present tense statute favors imprisoned purpose its purpose conviction he held safety safety concerns flight concerns whatever conviction yet and side imprisonment connection  connection conviction and chief justice ginsburg saying language favors sides reading youre given credit credit shows connection conviction thats argument now question breaks tie why theres tie two textual clues i elect reading reading i didnt say im assuming but   now thats true thats  raises interesting question why point look congress enacts statute right the statute going apply future it wants describe something anticipates occur future isnt natural use present tense so lets say  employer adopts rule says going forward employees work weekend get  employee works present tense weekend gets overtime what read   describe something going occur recurring basis future so natural use present tense why  infer that youre going examine persons status jail real time ask okay today  is  tomorrow do see im saying but government  im sorry interrupt they  but government   remedy though district court judge they issue warrant correct that something favors fact governments reading someone later released charges dismissed tolling so charges dismissed end detention credit given theres tolling and judge sat rights issuing warrant loses correct that doesnt make much sense if statute intended read way justice alito suggested lookback statute wouldnt make much sense well would still  thats theres conviction connection right no  doesnt help why i mean doesnt say judgment conviction and quite often prisoner offender issues guilty plea says im guilty jury may find guilty sentencing may take place months finally judgment enter now isnt jail hes pleaded guilty jury convicted connection conviction the government  government says look difference phrase connection word congress could used draw textual significance that fits larger purpose congress likely mind allowing double counting time youve spent physically prison justice ginsburg says counting supervised release so shouldnt draw significance use  whats used word where  it doesnt say language so    get i know thats think but im  im simply asking support doesnt say was argument raised part argument what do situation happens commonly district court fact statutes i believe  i could wrong  require mandatory detention guilty plea jury finding so someone jury  judges routinely the minute youre convicted basically new bail hearing put people would theory case still imprisonment relating conviction thats also true judgment conviction enters you might released bond pending appeal well little different i mean supervision lot easier persons jail right so i mean i understand point  seem  imprisonment changes obligations significantly supervised release  alters degree supervision i guess  i guess   interrupt i guess i would say i would think period youre detained lot like period youd imprisoned period youre free supervised but think    purpose supervised release a person  prison serving sentence receive vocational training sort training i thought purpose  supervised release parole see person would outside world i dont want take rebuttal time  thank counsel ms ellickson what yeah did contact defendant did reach state court do know whether continued functions supervised release what somebody held  i mean somebody held jail sheriff says this jail i supervise people i dont want federal probation officers messing around jail does  different thank counsel the case submitted,1045.0,1692,31,mr chief justice may please court petitioner serving federal term supervised release 10 months sitting state jail arrest sentencing new crimes that conclusion follows plain text section 3624e broadly tolls supervised release periods imprisonment connection conviction the  standard legislative drafting phrase statutes present tense and congress reasonably  yes yes thats correct know congress least one statute passed time sentencing reform act used present tense describe period  tolling  tolling would subject later determination and congress thought present tense appropriate way  frame statute it took approach statute well and  phrase connection indicates congress intending imprisonment necessarily follow conviction result conviction its changing tense statute the question really moment time inquiry occur when decide whether imprisonment connection conviction and friend side takes position know immediately but statute doesnt require the statute  i disagree your honor  phrase run used describe period considered tolled period but fact phrased  present tense mean inquiry happen time what sentence means  your honor i would read statute say moment inquiry tolling status period imprisonment becomes necessary moment determine whether  there  there may language congress  there  thats  yes i think  different ways statute could phrased well possible   although  formulation your honor proposed actually suggests tolling would apply imprisonment preceded conviction and congress evidently wanted make sure capacious understanding type imprisonment would qualify and makes sense context supervised release scheme supervised release time imprisonment imprisoned theyre ultimately incompatible states and made sense congress would want limit number situations person would deemed serving term supervised release custody my understanding thats  thats correct probation office generally treats pretrial detention triggering tolling capable supervising defendants  including jail pretrial detention way outside and number things probation officers defendants community simply possible jail ordering drug testing example asking defendant participate certain types community treatment  they  may  jailing facility may well but defendant jail supervision jailing facility he subject  its   awkward situation your honor in case defendant state jail also potentially petitioners theory serving term federal supervised release time so question is proba  federal probation officer really able supervise defendant way believes necessary execute term supervised release fact defendant jurisdiction state yes thats correct well  difference going much larger swath defendants and two exceptions congress decided put tolling provision make sense the first short periods detention reflect recognition defendant imprisoned short period time may disrupt experience supervised release he may able continue transitioning community it may interfere probation officers ability supervise and defendant imprisoned connection conviction congress determined perhaps exercise legislative grace give defendant credit time served jail defendant would otherwise receive sentencing credit it true defendant acquitted charges dismissed may also failed supervised release congress determined wasnt necessary automatic tolling circumstance perhaps congress concerned possibility defendant jailed mistake perhaps congress wanted  if  well difference defendant know defendant get credit another sentence time jail whereas defendant ultimately convicted almost invariably get credit presentencing detention thats matter  sentencing judge determine point becomes  defendants noncompliance supervised release rises level might warrant revocation proceedings in case judge determined defer decision state prosecutions concluded least defendant sentenced prosecutions uncommon often judges federal judges faced defendant accused new crime wants see  unfolds jurisdiction rushing judgment perhaps  whether defendant is guilty offense it would certainly appropriate  judge federal judge make determination chose many judges want wait see happens there guidelines and i think   case like one defendant violated criminal laws supervised release thats serious violation general matter warrant revocation but question timing revocation whether revocation come immediately whether district court potentially defer adjudication allow parallel  new criminal proceedings unfold in case  yes certainly congress could made policy call  number defendants jailed charges ultimately convicted actually  fairly small sliver compared   yes your honor yes the supervised release would serve purpose but   line congress decided draw clear statute thought conviction necessary wanted leave types imprisonments so  reasonable policy call make it  potentially mean defendants get little bit benefit terms supervised release outcome spending less time community supervision probation officer sentence dictated but congress determined matter policy wanted draw line it may  i think   inference i would draw congress may believed defendant jailed ultimately convicted necessarily failed supervised release in circumstance supervised release scheme gives federal judge tools determine whether nevertheless appropriate revoke defendant conduct it   certainly possible   district court sentenced may determine require additional supervised release whatever put jail fact indication failing supervised release needed supervised release revoked in context  federal judge would option revoking supervised release imposing new sentence imprisonment imposing supervised release the question default and congress determined defendants convicted default supervised release terms tolled theyre jail for defendants convicted congress set different default the default  tolling supervised release scheme federal judge additional tools deploy potentially add additional supervised release necessary if status defendants imprisonment time clear yet clear whether defendant going imprisoned 30 days connection conviction defendant would practical matter supervised release  pretrial detention possible supervised release term running if becomes clear  thats correct  point   yet determined whether term supervised release running defendant  cant subject terms supervised release later might turn term supervised release running convicted in case defendant would get credit time supervised release term would actually supervision period yes yes no thats correct and period defendants  tolling status period imprisonment unclear district courts jurisdiction would unclear district court long supervised release term yet ended would able adjudicate violation occurred well   yes so  defendant would gotten supervised release credit period pretrial detention acquittal clear point whether supervised release running defendant cant deemed required  there  your honor i think  rule court appeals pretrial   rule advocating pretrial detention forward  yes yes no  the ninth  yes the ninth circuit one opinions issue least determined  case short period imprisonment followed  entry defendants guilty plea they determined that connection conviction case so  yes they   made quick  quick discussion  if court addressing question courts addressed status  whether  imprisonment connection conviction either understanding conviction could  could mean statute defendants imprisonment would qualify certainly conviction means entry  guilty plea  oh sorry your honor  part question presented the question presented asked court determine tolling status entire period  petitioners state detention the petitioner needs period supervised release running entire period order get relief thats one  certainly court could we  know believe  line court draw question presented earlier line would encompass pretrial detention but  court determines thats appropriate line presumably answering question  line falls answer question court would determine whether period guilty plea verdict  the court certainly whatever court wants laughter no im  im  i  i would say court  i would  i would urge court decide question  well maybe  maybe  but  i would also like address fact petitioners reading  conflict text statute statutory scheme congress set with respect text statute phrase connection conviction inherently broad indicates congress intended broad range imprisonment toll supervised release imprisonment conviction imprisonment result conviction congress used alternative language statutes it chose use and  decision given meaning in addition defendant jail getting full experience supervised release makes sense congress would want minimize number defendants condition deemed supervised release custody we also know congress sentencing reform act determined defendants getting double credit time serve presentencing confinement another term imprisonment giving  interpretation tolling statute petitioner urging would give defendants double credit it would mean defendants pretrial detention also deemed supervised release  much larger interference supervised release scheme narrow exceptions suggest mean would interfere well double crediting system we also anomalous results would occur  term supervised release tolled part defendants sentence another crime in context imagine timing defendants guilty plea would effect supervised release outcome so example two identically situated defendants entered jail day ultimately received criminal sentence would different supervised release outcomes one pleaded guilty two months detention pleaded guilty six months you could also imagine situation two identical defendants go jail identical offenses different jurisdictions one jurisdiction happens process cases quickly the defendant  fastmoving jurisdiction different supervised release outcome defendant jurisdiction case adjudicated slowly yes your honor    period imprisonment sentence and say period connection conviction  strange indeed and seems anomalous defendants get potentially supervised release benefit penalty  well your honor terms  crediting supervised   pretrial detention i would  id like note actually large majority jurisdictions required automatic time pretrial detention credited sentence thats rule federal system 45 states district columbia there five states potential  credit well its automatic way well  in theory judge could issue warrant little bit odd answer problem presented defendant goes jail supervised release and fact  3583i warrant procedure added statute 1994 10 years congress designed  the statutory language indicates conviction means adjudication guilt plea trial you look first sentence 3624e tolling provision  earlier part   statutory provision refers sentence and fact 3624e elsewhere uses word sentence decided shift word conviction context tolling provision indicates congress intended refer different moment different event criminal adjudicative proceedings we also know sentencing reform act congress regularly used word conviction convicted refer state adjudicated guilty entry sentence and used often term judgment conviction entry judgment refer later moment judgment conviction entered so plain language 3624e larger statute part indicate conviction means earlier moment time but even conviction referred judgment conviction happens connection sentencing defendant still imprisoned connection conviction pleads guilty found guilty jury later detained detention least part assure appearance sentencing ensure receive entry judgment conviction largely certain point and also  point  imprisonment becomes punitive longer subject presumption innocence so reasons even know  whatever meaning court gives conviction certainly period guilty plea would tolled  believe entire period imprisonment would  tolled time served state sentence still serving state sentence connection  state convictions landed jail first place so thank i would ask court affirm,711.0,1042,34,ms ellickson whatever i dont think really clear i mean connection justice sotomayor says connection broad phrase but i guess hand grammatically possible say person is meaning suggesting currently imprisoned connection conviction conviction hasnt occurred yet the dictionary act says presumption present tense congress so go ahead finish i mean connection i say i totally accept point broad question whether effectively change tense statute broad and   seems strange way read language but doesnt because  lets know go back little bit statute it says term doesnt run person imprisoned connection conviction right so doesnt term run the term doesnt run person imprisoned connection conviction meaning conviction occurred person imprisoned connection no the inquiry doesnt dont read sentence think really means just read sentence think means no dont tell means read language embodies think well i mean matter i read okay person imprisoned connection conviction he wasnt he imprisoned connection suspicion probable cause whatever standard committed crime thats conviction so i want read past present future way embodies think wouldnt draft statute clearly clearly different way thats congress intended as justice ginsburg  justice  ive done  justice kagan said  laughter  ambiguity doesnt ambiguity suggest clearer way write thats congress intended they could instead imprisonment could said period detention but could  i mean could said  i think closer justice breyer looking  period person considered imprisoned connection conviction and i  i  i mean difficulty theyre engaging  something legal fiction theres conviction judge says well youre getting five years going start counting 10 months ago i mean   process imposing sentence sort changes nature period counted now i dont know way counts  seems way read thats pretty close way reads my problem i think unambiguous and  way i think write would connection crime respect later convicted thatll i mean thats  thats  wouldnt say  see  see thats im looking the chief come pretty close but i  well friend side suggests thats true suggests youre detention lot features supervised release still continue why drug testing i  i assume drug testing prison pretty regular basis which may different  supervised release it could  one jurisdiction person held detention someplace else so  probation officer access jurisdictions jail even  i right  even view statute run problem certain situations youll run confinement fewer 30 days youll run defendant ends acquitted isnt right so different but the probation office determination judges determination preponderance evidence an acquittal really doesnt tell whether defendant successfully integrated community judge could always hold hearing preponderance evidence find hadnt still keep longer maybe earlier case decided but point seems that acquittal  i dont understand legislative grace get language statute but wasnt    would detained shouldnt time reading extended but doesnt  can back explain get mess need tolling how supervised release work that   case defendant failed two drug tests supervised release nothing done he submitted another substance nothing done he first charged marijuana offense state court nothing done at point judge blow whistle supervised release and thats totally individual judge there guidelines released person done something warrants putting back prison under legislative grace argument i think choice reading connection capaciously reading kind i think would characterize hypertextually on  legislative grace argument though really undercuts purpose say capacious reading would serve in words congress really time spend prison wouldnt created  would made count do understand but purpose would still served circumstance correct and  think reasonable policy call can explain would way even though definition person would jail longer  potentially long period time i see seems unfair big picture level i guess im seeing policy call suppose  defendant  pretrial detention something would constitute violation conditions supervised release can grounds revocation im sorry just  case way interpret happened mr mont done term pretrial detention would ground revocation  supervised  so  and would district court time jurisdiction consider  adjudicate alleged violation occurred incarceration where would deprived jurisdiction period so lets assume following hypothetical defendant arrested drug charges hes later acquitted jail commits drug offense your claim would district court cant find violation situation period suspended he cant issue warrant that  thats renders imprisoned language little bit suspect statute youre sort looking backwards time instead looking present moment suspension period starts 30 days detention youre looking forward youre looking forward start counting whenever conviction sentence happens by way issue wasnt reached courts you raise all right didnt reach and wasnt argued has court argued point  im sorry argued addressed issue decided theres least two ninth circuit   one circuit  petitioners side have either two courts addressed issue in case but didnt address legal question full all right so first ones address assuming disagree main point agree adversary reach question hasnt addressed fully courts no im saying agree question  question granted reach alternative argument that   entered  conviction detention changed security  imprisonment conviction i guess i  im  im still struggling question is good reason though would court first view rather court review question effect guilty plea why wouldnt let percolate you yet win case its yet decided  court appeals case wouldnt normal practice counsel waiting i got or could remand right and i  i giving opportunity tell wouldnt but dont want thats okay even lose one maybe laughter is reason  well  im  im sorry i going say thats i mean theyre going different periods preconviction detention well well sentencings judges may say get credit time pretrial detention others would say dont i mean people different situations different consequences i guess including supervised release that doesnt seem particularly compelling the things seemed serious  could tell theres cost filing warrant judge i mean administrative cost ordering warrant lodged something else judge would system would to effect warrant keep active   would reason judge wouldnt issue warrant someones arrested what   would want say anything imagine lose everything the last desperate point decide it says conviction now  cocounsel argues conviction means entry judgment conviction plead guilty

facie evidence would ever possible decrees operate prospectively would contain adjudication past now fact evidence government action covers many years going back 1920s i remember rightly the findings case based evidence courts per curiam enforced affirmance find pertinent language finding case government action findings justified evidence support decree decree hanover relying now neither decree findings district court massachusetts courts affirmance suggestion cut particular point nowhere decision district court suggestion cut there government decree decree government action findings conclusions court action additional evidence introduced hanover covered whole period statute limitations told the court appeals holds however fine however everything united june 10 1946 precisely united prior june 10 1946 everything united date unlawful damages may recovered everything prior date lawful may damages now i think demonstrated briefs prior case prior rule law overruled american tobacco alcoa and decisions pointed relied decisions predating uniteds adoption leasing system condemned government action adopted 1922 both justice  judge hand court relied decisions predating 1922 the said american tobacco alcoa new developments made new interpretations of statute goes back 1890 principles established many years happens constantly antitrust field theres nothing new nothing noble it mean never meant nuances grow bring decrees prospective effect bar trebledamage action do think argument detected retroactivity damages adopted court criminal proceedings no i dont think relation two mr justice harlan why those doctrines generally  i believe enforcement criminal statutes protection constitutional rights either providing something done wasnt done prohibiting something done done here statute nothing new upheld time time question constitutionality its interpreted time time it developed time time courts if real overruling provision i could see relevance criminal cases constitutional provision involved i could see relevance otherwise i afraid relevance escapes that point united urges brief no we suing basis refusal sell way get back 1912 our suit damages due monopolization that monopolization continuous courts found set forth brief every single time united exacts hanover rent royalty payment enables exact violation law new cause action hanover seeking costs exposed monopolization statutory period it seeks nothing  costs imposed upon prior statutory period so i think whole argument 1912 based refusal sell basis action damages antitrust laws due monopolization merit so little merit i think court even consider personal opinion but i dont think connection two answer question mr justice stewart specifically there conditional cross petition mr justice white we petitioned basis two grounds court appeals sent back new trial mr carson filed crosspetition that right 335 hanovers petition 463 crosspetition filed mr carson yes last point brief end yes every single point urged crosspetition liability rejected courts tax points court appeals went neither briefed argued court appeals court now supposed change law  how decided the court went invented designed devised rule damages what mr carson argued court appeals position primarily takes government decree decree government action prospective effect retroactive effect that argument rejected court appeals came i submit new unsound rule damages respect taxes  pardon taxes respect retroactivity cutting june 10 1946 if i said taxes i misspoke i meant retroactivity june 10 1940  june 10 1946 the supposed change law ought take place june 10 1946 cane phrased simply the law mere sized exerted power actions predatory practices constitute antitrust violation now one looks statute one finds word predatory practices the statute speaks monopolizing commerce restraints competition statute aimed developing maintaining free market statute doesnt distinction polite restraints impolite restraints gentlemanly exclusions market ungentlemanly exclusions market let us assume principle let us assume still law midsize unexerted power constitute violation the trouble principle doesnt fit united there question united size power tremendous monopolistic position shoe machinery trade particularly machines hanover lease but leasing system condemned government action used power monopolistic position preserve power position means practically married shoe manufacturers monopoly maintaining shoe manufacturers courts said captive market exclusion competition one hardly say power unexerted one certainly cannot deny size the success met years exclusionary practices proves maintenance monopoly position ultimate evidence effectiveness exclusionary practices condemned government action that need market united avoid competition i may use word i found one opinions court crafts method price cutting its method exclusionary its method courts held district court government action held excluded actual potential competition we submit basis court appeals taking split damage period practically half way we submit court appeals error second ground petition 335 now something must mentioned connection claims retroactivity whether one considers uniteds claims 463 court appeals approach three prior cases united in district court case united claimed resting unique record res judicata thank honor recess thank mr chief justice may please court at recess i began mention district court united asserted resting unique record res judicata respect three prior cases i think short answer oral argument appeal government action court uniteds counsel counsel mr carson expressly asked considered three prior cases res judicata answered flat united also claims lease policy condemned government action appeal government action briefs uniteds counsel described lease policy district court found basic vice system but aside united really claims three prior actions approved leasing policy we set forth briefs im going take courts time detailing analysis cases specifically one held i make flat statement condemned government action never presented court accordingly passed in 1922 decision clayton act case throughout tying provisions uniteds leases united adopted forms leases leasing policy i call leasing system court government case years added additional policies also part leasing system it combination attacked government action combination never passed upon sanctioned court and combination policies practices held constitute monopolization district court i afraid i repeating basis combination held united excluded actual potential competition restricted free market i beg pardon in course opinion district court government action detailed effects uniteds policies practices produced shoe manufacturers shoe machinery manufacturers also set forth shoe manufacturers now brief treat law target area argument presented united 463 i think short answer whole target area argument found findings district court united action government action precisely effects shoe manufacturers uniteds exclusionary policy as matter fact seems extremely difficult imagine anybody could directly affected monopoly customer must deal monopoly monopolized market now neither court found decree government action ambiguous they found hold i said course argument your honors hold but united 463 seeks create ambiguity court held government action claims court government action hold lease policy means monopolization and building claim contrives ambiguity and basis contrived ambiguity claims district court certified question government decree meant district court massachusetts united claims error failure district court now begin rule practice federal system whereby trebledamage courts refer decree entering courts interpretation decrees entered decree entering court the trebledamage courts job decide case there decree black white decree merely decree district court massachusetts it effect decree court affirmed court obviously every trebledamage court passing upon decree entered another court task asking decree mean arrives interpretation if wrong reversed appeal there need running back forth courts i conceive greater waste judicial time judicial manpower rule united contends another contrived argument advanced united lease charge dismissed court government action again spelled detail complaint finding court decision opinion court government action submit crystal clear charges dismissed related vices industry united involved relate shoe machinery industry court specifically held monopolized united further united would escape liability called passing now passing issue subject separate trial back 1959 1960 four days trial it decided district court uniteds favor the court appeals affirmed this court denied certiorari im sorry oh thank ralph i mean hanovers favor i  hanovers counsel i believe case untied says however measure damages judge goodrich passing trial different measure damages hanover presented trial the separate trial held basis stipulation judge goodrich decide stipulation provide assumed purposes trial violation law excessive cost shoe machinery alleged complaint existed now let us look hanovers complaint hanovers complaint alleged two types injury i mentioned excessiveness rentals excessive cost machinery denied right purchase and i interesting read  interested read uniteds main brief 463 page 14 united set forth kinds injury alleged hanovers complaint united suggests primary claim comparison leasing ownership cost first advanced trial it must stoop memory part uniteds counsel united knew beginning alleged complaint copies tabulations course discovery delivered united long trial began but really passing argument united based primarily oil java cases similarity found cases hanover situation unlike oil jobers ph cases guaranteed margin basically cases could unlike oil jobbers hanover buy sell machinery hanover used machinery it consumer speak use machinery leased further absolutely relation rather infrequent changes uniteds rents royalties frequent changes sales prices hanover shoes actually one analyzes uniteds argument passing comes hanover operated profit whole period therefore must passed if didnt pass might operated loss so new rule antitrust law trebledamage plaintiff despised restraints makes profit may recover trebledamage plaintiff unfortunate enough lose money may recover i find justification statute case doctrine the short answer whole passing one judge goodrich gave first mr justice stewart courts go beyond first step assessing damages and secondly excess cost imposed united hanover would money use whatever wanted use business and contrary uniteds contention wind fall hanover rather balancing scales i suspect windfall united would like keeping fruits monopoly i havent thought may i moment mr justice white an inconsistency passing  yes i respect passing adopt general rule courts go beyond first step taxes going beyond first step wit point exaction excess royalties i see inconsistency intellectual concept speak right order oil jobber cases yes now fact passed fact situation like example oil jobber cases example incidentally machine cost prepare shoes run similar item sense pair let us assume every time united changed rates increased 01 share  increased sales price 01 share and let us assume case oil jobber case united guaranteed would still make much money sales shoes increase sales prices with set facts i would say hanover position recover thus far fact situation now i know whether ive answered question mr justice white united would deny recovery says formal demand sell now courts considered claim lack formal demand concluded circumstances case demand would vital futile the court appeals i thought i phrased fairly well i paraphrasing said i cannot remember offhand they said demand would really demand monopoly one powerful persistent monopolist would demand monopolist seized monopolizing i think described notion ironic contention circumstances demand required united brings interesting notion called cost capital claiming cost capital first first claimers i know first second two claims one cost capital hanover faced  would face would never buy machines secondly determining damages cost capital determined deducted award the cost capital solely economic concept maybe concept cutting us it occasionally course short trial bit humor would get case i remember expert cited authority cost capital approach certain document certain book i foolish enough read book incidentally expert hadnt quite precise percentages applied hanovers called cost capital when i read book i found author said pen economists measured cost capital ibm would 10 answers and i asked relied book said yes i asked relied said “no authors wrong there” they right sense economic theory of course it theory used economists guide deciding whether certain investment might might worthwhile in sense cost in accounting sense cost it disbursement item expense incurred course operation it reflected profit loss statement but even theory capital two kinds equity borrow cost capital talked cost equity capital in case borrowings cost capital interest rate agreed experts hanover held fact surplus equity surplus even current assets hanover purpose calculations assumed would borrow money business otherwise go gone fact and period called supposed acquisitions hanover fact paid prime rate sounds like old times the prime rate 15 2 hanover deducted calculations pursuant judge harrys direction direction 25 now hanover cost capital fully accounted calculations hanover cost capital certainly cost equity capital both courts considered cost capital theory both rejected conclusion i submit would ridiculous as i said beginning suggests i coming end reason basic position hanover treated differently trebledamage plaintiffs relies decree prior government action hanover damaged uniteds monopolization cannot possibly disputed the district courts decision held cost hanover 1413000 lease machines would cost hanover rented free market and district court said quite accurately one short answers uniteds contention”by monopolization hanover aimed hit” we submit your honors please court appeals reversed points set forth number 335 we submit points raised united 463 worthy courts consideration i thank your honors yes  yes oh yes completely in full full trebled amount united gets deduction tax return whatever recovery pays this set forth examples brief mr justice white i thank your honors mr carson i suppose courts affirmance judge wyzanski decree courts affirmance  position say thought affirmed even it affirmed decree it affirmed decree may say thought heard just moment i hope consume mr chief justice i going make effort whatever reply bits pieces testimony truncated version colloquy judge wyzanski the record speaks answer readily found clearly stated elaborate careful findings judge sheridan court i want refer one thing mr carsons separation far government action concerned lease leasing provisions as separate distinct things they things went together operated together combination caused monopolization as matter fact plain ordinary common sense united leasing practice whereby could lease machines exclusionary provisions time said shoe manufacturer “you may buy machines want” exclusionary practices would nothing a manufacturer get shoe manufacturer get buying machines as say brief lease made exclusionary practices really effective i say circumstances lease condemned to violence simple logic just little sideline mr carson said werent damaged practices well happened run head take free service supposedly service without separate charge we show trial portion united rentals taken care i finished   taken cared service charges amounted 239000 hanover bought machines five years later incurred actual cost service despite great raise rates paid service cost amounted 118000 so even substantially damaged i thank your honors generosity time,147.0,176,12,number 699  number 335 hanover shoe company incorporated petitioner versus united shoe machinery corporation number 463 united shoe machinery corporation petitioner versus hanover shoe incorporated mr hayes i know i quite understand rule assessing damages courts go beyond first step what mean what mean now wouldnt follow cause action accrued back around 1912 youre inspired statute limitations wouldnt follow argument voice overlap but law always always clear newly discovered always has crosspetition case so sets brief right yes and crosspetitioner contend suit wholly barred statute limitation and court appeals rejected how decided you said argued  we recess mr hayes mr hayes may continue argument mr hayes see essential inconsistency court appeals respect taxes yet rejecting pass penalty it seems could well argue going get actual pocket cost taxing could well get thing passing if actually passed let us assume actually passed  say actually passed remedies customer  and perhaps losing money yet court permitted  permits recover spite passed well can i ask are hanovers recovery possible all  mr carson finish statement,3151.0,3678,7,hanovers favor you mean hanovers favor mr chief justice may please court on behalf united shoe machinery corporation appellant number 463 appellee number 335 i like present case differently order points detailed analysis your honors see brief form narration happened relations parties order may see points developed go along first however i like statements fresh your honors mind emphasize two points indeed concessions mr hayes made course argument the first statement remarkable i wrote suing basis refusal sell he goes say “we suing damage due monopolization” but i ask your honors monopolization accept inability buy damages computed except comparing called ownership costs called lease costs why hanover say suing refusal sell courts held finding contested demand now second interesting point mr hayes made basic argument point tax decision court appeals wrong charges hanover taxes effect income taxes judgment damages proved i think i right saying mr hayes argued that wrong court appeals wrongly pursued theory hanover choice choices fiction since choice inability buy hanover could charged income tax savings course assumed purchased operation put words hanovers last brief number 335 blue brief court appeals espousing fiction choice espousing self destructive argument one automatically abolished possibility damage yes well theyre cited brief your honor i recur i  mr potter looking i refer basis award hanover would purchased instead forced lease cost purchase less cost leasing now conceded calculation i come later tax saving annual monthly rental royalty payments omitted conceded would amounted several hundred thousand dollars together charging cost capital i come later viewed contemporaneously time purchase would wiped called benefit purchase made purchase 949000 costly now your honor asked precedence on page 9  in trebledamage cases i know i referring reasoning public utility commission 1954  you seen it appears none theory damage adapted consideration taxes perhaps i go later part argument call your honors attention – my experience include your honor i know case denial right purchase resulted comparison purchase price aggregate lease charges i think  i see would your honor it difficult look forward supposititious cases i think concerned 683 machines leased i know court concerned i submit unique situation i know situation i conceive none lessee leased without protest 16 years fact 55 years benefited use machines very handsomely never buy yet recovered award basis would bought done i think court i assume your honors would comes comfortable form court would say court appeals said taxes “calculations must include elements business corporation would necessarily consider choosing two alternatives” now hanover monopoly mr hayes calls free market hanover testified would like bought united machines theory recovery would lost benefit annual tax savings they would gotten certain benefits way temporary deduction money paid purchase they would made recovery depreciation now matters laid district court calculation dr corson defendant exhibit 52 inclusion cost capital along tax saving found district court would  purchase would expensive 949000 yet district court left entirely calculation basis looking backward 1962 yes would calculation it might situation tax benefit wouldnt existed the accountant took account happened it sets forth exhibit hanovers actual tax rates now surprising thing your honors i perhaps develop later i point dr corson testifying expert called united dr syrt ph economist academic economist called hanover agreed look operations year year assumption choice buy lease 1939 1940 1941 take account tax considerations cost capital considerations parties experts parted solely basis dr syrt said “here i got computations assumption purchase looking backward damages i wouldnt allow taxes cost capital” yes mr chief justice he later corrected he misspoke he said first tax matter argued court appeals corrected said retroactivity argued us way court appeals i brief court appeals page 69 i think mr hayes agree slip tongue corrected income tax point argued taken accepted court appeals reasoning i reiterate seems us unexceptional now seems us your honor case beg leave characterize result except corrected court appeals gross miscarriage justice case presents number points rather remarkable court in case points i narrate facts judgment based practice leasing injury hanover benefit it testified completely satisfactory you absence demand purchase you underlying decree i think i shall demonstrate condemn lease you judge wyzanski characterized change law made retroactive district court you basic errors damage calculation i briefly mentioned ignoring statute limitations adding together make think unjust result now background statement let tell court briefly record happened hanover began small family company making shoes pennsylvania it organized time united shoe corporation organized 1900 according complaint lease relationships date back 1912 in fact undoubtedly date back much earlier hanover remained small family company 1956 judge wyzanskis decree first time 1956 issued stock public by 1960 begun small family company one 35 biggest prosperous shoe manufacturers united states its profit rate regularly increased 1939 its profit figures shown page 245 joint appendix show 35 55 20 years went 300000 taxes 4 million taxes now relationship united partly source prosperity hanover relationship i say continuous since least 1912 it 1930 first case came court criminal indictment united states based original constitution united combination machinery companies and dismissal indictment supported  affirmed court opinion justice holmes it interest view contention judge wyzanskis conclusion uniteds leasing practice approval court beginning it interest your honor note solicitor general said 1913 presenting first claim sherman act he said “this case presents question whether legal gather together one corporation 80 interstate trade particular line activity done gradually legitimate methods without unfair competition characterized tobacco standard oil cases if legal sooner business world understands better” on particular case involve propriety leases court held conduct united legal to resume record united 1953 judge wyzanski careful review 40 years behavior defendant held exhibited predatory practices monopoly profits developed language court appeals approval leasing policy various forms three successive decisions supreme court this 1913 i first referred courts judgment in 1918 lessees attacked bill equity came court 247 united states division court the charge violation sherman act sections 1 2 and your honors find sharp division mr hayes mr hayes said downright terms decision nothing approval uniteds leasing practice i ask your honors read opinions justice mckenna dissent justice day see i read words question whether leases coerced shoe manufacturers taken disposed court held leases coercive mr hayes language carefully selected i owe say really asserted court prior decisions supreme court deal exact practices judge wyzanski dealt that true thats true in 1922 said leases altered third decision court clayton act tying causes taken a 17year term changed 10year term all complete silence acquiescence hanover the leases deformed leasing practice went i call courts attention gravamen hanover case called lease say inability buy certain groups machines the gravamen hanovers case i shall demonstrate four restrictive causes judge wyzanski condemned 1953 i mention moment gravamen continuance leasing distribution important productive lucrative shoe machines hanover used now point your honors throughout clayton act case 1923 sherman act case 1918 sherman criminal case 1930 that practice lease constant in none cases  none situations shoe manufacturers situation described courts able buy machines distributed lease it fair say court discuss question none three judgments court discussed whether inability buy violation i think judge wyzanski held inability buy constitutional violation i note mr hayes says base case refusal sell but obvious second cases 247 us divided members court discussed whether existing leases honorous coercive shoe makers the majority said mind  must mind alternative way purchase and put brief interesting language threejudge court massachusetts discussed considerable detail approval leasing policy far concerned shoe manufacturers now dealing hanover i felt necessary lay background prior judicial approval united leasing practice lease business judge wyzanski said opinion read united leasing practices never condemned part endorsed supreme court thank sir you why merits judgment we your honor number points yes our first point government decree first point brief judgment founded primarily constitute adjudication lease violation i elaborate saying dictate well apparently case crosspetition well i perhaps said yes i thought justice fortas mind crosspetition 463   stated seven questions that one now i go elaborate alright now second point judgment judge wyzanski mr hayes relies condemnation lease past violation condemn future required us sell alternatively optionally retroactive effect yes no say future the requirement sell imposed judge affirmed court yes yes yes theory lease now injury hanover four restrictive practices leases judge wyzanski particularly discussed condemned course would recovery yes yes constantly constantly we cases brief determine whether eagle lion case came court your honors divided four four held judgment support recovery decree deal practice injured plaintiff i number cases brief i know trebledamage case retroactivity point arose and your honor i taken time recite unique record judicial approval lease policy court courts 1953 judge wyzanski changed that i taken time perhaps i view your honors question addressed maybe courts mind effect reversal trebledamage cases mr hayes gone far say contentions correct person injured antitrust violation recover respect past antitrust violation corrected prospectively now course make contention let direct clause 4 decree the decree your honors bound volume joint appendix judge wyzanski said leases unduly restrictive find page decree 10year term long they repair service without extra charge they full capacity clause impose return charges return machines now analyzed relation keeping competition shoe machinery manufacturers he claims private parties claim united states paragraph 61 complaint among offenses charged said paragraph 61 united declined sell important machines now dismissed clause decree dismisses merits matters four clauses and would seem drift your honors question effect trebledamages cases would four clauses judge condemned injure hanover it perhaps oversight briefs didnt even discussed question never claimed the injury ever claimed inability buy resulted assertedly excessive leasing charge but let go back four the 10year term 1939 limitations begins older machines fiveyear renewal basis new ones free right return cutting 10year period lessee wished united volition created called right deduction fund the right deduction fund made royalties paid particular lessee credited used pay return charges now shoe machinery makers judge wyzanski said restrictive it keeps competitors shoe manufacturers like hanover benefit 10year term never affected hanover testified page 301 record never pay return charge reason second free repair service charged restrictive practice kept shoe machinery makers hanover benefit lessees required hanover repair machines expense united expense and court found hanover paid service paying lease charges court also found lease charges reasonable i cite pages 51 61 100 189 joint appendix third full capacity clause held restrictive devices competitors mr sheppard hanover testified never enforced and fourth return charges return machines never paid hanover continuing credit voluntarily created right deduction fund so regards impact contention trebledamage cases may come court say giving full effect adjudication judge wyzanski made hanover didnt try bring within cases violation found past course people injured would entitled claim injury but i think your honors would interested fact hanover never complained unable buy suit filed september 1955 hanover expressed positive satisfaction leasing system as chanced defendant brought judge wyzanski trial number shoe manufacturers testified satisfactory character lease system without particular regard four objectionable clauses whether would prefer buy rather lease and somewhat disbelief judge wyzanski 13 whose testimony cited page 14 main brief number 463 13 produced testified like leasing would rather lease buy of course great advantage leasing your honors puts competitors footing the charges uniform judge wyzanski said “small companies like hanover beginning capital get full equipment machinery paying monthly charge” now mr sheppard president hanover going asked testify among people as happened called the testimony getting accumulated record clear said interview senior partner mr kendall sheppard 1950 concerning leasing system i cite record page 335 mr sheppard pro united shoe thing leases like fact allowed competition hurt he said objection i leasing fact lease everybody he said directly record uniteds control shoe manufacturers lot nonsense he said quoted person interview “his big objection leasing system caused many competitors company” so carrying story i endeavored treat chronologically 1953 situation hanover prospered use leases never claimed right purchase fact affected direct object monopoly monopoly directed uniteds competitors certainly normal monopolization giving united control shoe machinery market would exclude shoe machinery manufacturers now fact competitors like campbell shoe machinery producers leased machines exclusively leasing traditional business going since civil war all course save united restrictive effects four clauses kept competitors four clauses affect hanover now i must hurry i think perhaps i better get moment passing since mr hayes mentioned i thought i might leave briefs largely matter interpreting cases i think i sum saying word injury clayton act treated differently different courts respect whether plaintiff middle man consumer product it middle man court still say cases cited passing alleged excess cost gives cause action consumer uses shoe machinery says court said different even though passed excess cost still injured mr hayes reminds theory justice holmes railroad antitrust case first impact counts that seem logical seem consonant with your honors decision amec case cited brief tax case plaintiff transferred obligation undertook longer cause action but cases shaped passing defense different case because courts hold despite mr hayes said brief gives references lease terms rental rates parties reasonable the district court refused find unreasonable comments district court said granted reasonable leases lawful defendant still liable the leases alright they objectionable its inability objectionable now come inability buy plaintiff done total fabricate total called purchase price that purchase price certainly could asserted 1955 complaint filed in fact calculated 1961 that perhaps makes difference i point court year year 16 years alleged violation hanover making profit year year paying 08 per lease charges but according stipulation record cited brief making profit calculated cost put cost shoe machinery time suit filed hanover completely paid this first time passing come court since justice brandeis intimated kiel case back 1922 might valid defense antitrust case cited briefs i think high time issue comes determinated court recognize equity allowing satisfied lessee indemnified resale prices victimize defendant trebledamage charge injury time lease payments transactions lawful according courts another point dealt great deal briefs i believe i shorter  of course your honor welcome no it true could day let us say certain machine clicker may even 5 month suppose 4 hanover would paid 4 instead 5 bit remember competitors would and justice brandeis pointed kiel case treated alike get benefit change competing with united decide would make difference of course judge goodrich says maybe could bought leather i dont see thats connected proposition what i coming i dont know i answered your honors question i coming say simplify calculating  damage calculation point i think mr hayes given opening i require i cannot course involve court details elaborate calculation district court went hanover attached appendix brief written description judge sheridan certainly patient matter saw damage calculations now written description i criticize two particulars i already adverted i recall your honors determinating tax benefit lease payments actually made cost capital consideration now cost capital defined district court rate return investors expect money put company and conception hanover spends million dollars buying shoe machinery lost money unless makes shoe machinery return put investors million dollars put the concept described abundantly record the thing judge sheridan mr hayes criticized i freely admit cost capital could computed different ways but item cost capital taken account fair comparison your honors leasing versus ownership agreed sides in fact i would like emphasize briefs bring hanover purchased used shoe machinery united pursuant decree prices machinery worked negotiations shoe manufacturers group united each side economist dr joel dean dr robert anthony economist said “in reaching price got compute cost capital entire group” dean said 10 anthony said 18 i cite illustrate item exists and youre going look purchase versus lease contemporaneously hanover make decision i would say fair way look would look time decisions supposititiously made 39 40 41 hanover actually leased says would liked buy now happens arithmetical consequences two methods laid clearly exhibits court there three four great exhibits called lightest calculations made statisticians assumptions counsel they omit taxes cost capital and side calculations include exhibits 48 51 52 only first two i sorry say reprinted joint appendix and allowance two items basis contemporaneous choice shows uncontestably purchase would cost 949000 leasing and course i would assume hanover content lease now approach rest exclusively i say advocate i cite statement hanovers expert page 562 record said “is point lightest calculations plaintiffs calculations omitting cost capital etcetera lightest calculations documents would presented management order decide whether buy lease” “oh definitely not” says on hand says computed allowance factors page 561 basically kind thing one would present management decide whether buy lease says elsewhere page 547 relation mr justice fortas taxes context this plaintiffs expert richard m syrt i would heartily endorse notion introducing taxes making decision preparing data management make decision whether purchase so perfectly clear issue court decide balancing enormous amounts money recounted calculations simple common sense question deciding equities parties relative costs two methods do look time plaintiff deprived right purchase wanted purchase could say look way mr hayes persuaded district court err miracle advocacy taking great volumes saying assumed cost purchase tell whether cost capital taxes go and expert says “oh course cant backwards you cant backwards made decision leaving out” well says dr syrt “i going put in” now i would perhaps emphasize i perhaps summed briefly case stands damages i think gross injustice done leaving prime economic factors built question purchase perhaps even worst thing really mentioned brief much talk your honors constantly familiar installment sales plaintiff added together without discount present value lease payments 16 years you got total compared single purchase price of course everybody knows one purchase cheaper 16 time payments point adding gross dollars but discount present value brings back fair comparative status none none on i said your honor part factors lack demand inability purchase cost hanover nothing bought would 900000 costly so damages and i would course seems i stand affronted possibility antitrust violator given case created damage i seem find commentators occasionally  judicial opinions suggestion monopoly found got find someone punish plaintiff whoever comes court statutory counsel fee private attorney general administers punishment i think vindication majesty law rests solely private plaintiffs rests important particular if government failed criminal indictment 1913 judgment your honors predecessors government failed bill equity 1923 decision court time and clayton act violations repaired third case i think united comes judgment new development law due american tobacco case correction must made violation i think inheres angel justice find private person got make money judge wyzanski cured errors violations he laid strict decree case number 597 come your honors end month find decree scrupulously complied now form redress majesty law sir yes a congressional direction sir yes sir i fully accede realize voice overlap in case voice overlap with difference i feel i course speaking record relation rights client facts case i would assume  i would think lease inability buy condemned judge wyzanski case and therefore hanover ground among others standing i would think reason plaintiffs court i handicap im obliged answer respect state fact your honors mind no i say vacuum i say context law strict adherence decision relied clayton act basis recovery now comes germane whatever i next going say excuse sir i attempted answer your honors point i sure i dealt you warned i must claim much i responded best way i let look particular point under rule amec case clayton act section 4 decree underlying government case effect estoppel estoppel far decree goes one differences mr hayes far decree goes brief makes perfectly clear say judge wyzanski condemned lease court approved lease 1953 1954 affirmed judge wyzanski and judge wyzanski thought approved judge wyzanski dismissed clause governments complaint paragraph 61 attacked refusal sell i go in view fact judge sheridans interpretation decree different another district judge judge berk western district new york coon case complaint copy hanover complaint in view asked judge wyzanski exercise reserved jurisdiction government case amend interpret decree hanover appeared opposed government counsel government case appeared judge wyzanski difference judge sheridan refused interfere account comity coordinate courts but said considered practice supreme court approves erie tompkins case certifying question treble damage court antitrust court in course colloquy judge wyzanski i said government counsel interesting colloquy government counsel appears pages 19 21 brief record read long judge wyzanski made arresting remark addressed government counsel rule amec case party entitled enforce estoppel hanover would enforce the judge said page 20 “now are aware previous occasions government never contended i never ruled judge sheridan supposes matter decided” that clear information court appeals thought clear information judge wyzanski thought judge sheridan wrong interpreting decree decision judge wyzanski yes yes sir yes yes yes yes particularly since tried implement we think come court say binding construction judge sheridan made construction we said tried implement asking reference certification questions your honors approved national gypsum case avoid multiple conflicting decisions and judge sheridan reason still clear refused depart decision made direction what court appeals say score the court appeals said theres much merit uniteds construction language much merit uniteds statement decree wyzanski hit lease but court appeals said unfortunately application timely the application made us soon could judge sheridan rendered decision judgment and authority books proper reference question fit proper first take opinion trial court because may well would superfluous go reference grounds case goes another ground the court appeals i think felt said position much merit let us say reasons clear could take accept argument even though directed maintenance result basic feature case meaning underlying government decree yes your honor we made motion rehearing tax  yes sir yes sir i think no none we made new motion new trial rule i attached subject discussion judge sheridan now basic point meaning decree vital 5 million turns case lasted district court years years yes not unless invited court jurisdiction now i time emphasize lack demand inadequacy finding hanover would bought machines that basic whole case district judge said likely would bought machine yes your affirmance per curiam and affirmed found  sir it indeed of course may i think take account i refer brief counsel government said lease attacked appeal thank you,427.0,503,28,is precedence supporting position could tell i want trebledamage cases i read brief as i understand since clayton act trebledamage cases litigated theory appears none why i think practically every  well great many trebledamage cases sister brother particular one got cousins tax theory might applied worked would stop tax would confine theory precise cases would every trebledamage case involves exclusion access particular product particular technique would say tax consequence choice actually made choice might made taken account unhappily know mr carson always look  suppose every one years question hanover leasing machinery hanover paid tax in words loss bracket mr carson i understood  mr hayes say issue neither raised argued district court briefs argument court appeals i wonder no need going it would recounted mr carson i confess i difficulty because i understand theory argument addressed i take us merits judgment client trebledamage suit well explain yes as distinguished various points made measure damages retroactivity yes no i think i understand but bringing us say condemnation lease called lease   respect future you presenting us claiming that error that i thought what saying  judge wyzanski affirmed court made order prospective   case trebledamages cannot properly awarded retroactive basis now may i ask addressing trebledamage cases is theory sort approved courts trebledamage case you tell there question whether government decree properly basis judgment particular judgment i talking retroactivity called retroactivity point trebledamage case supports position can i interrupt moment does record answer question whether hanover would better shape lease charges lower they may passed  may passed according argument would damages case well damages  damages  damages throughout law particularly antitrust law something artificial concept isnt that say thing congressional direction unring bell  to unring bell unring bell congressional direction try unravel unravelable events thus speculate would happened world different allegedly monopolistic restrictive practices engaged and say i understand certain conventions lawyers judges summed word damages and i admire candor suggesting consequence approach case would  candor arithmetic suggesting consequence approach case liability would found would damages but whats bothering mr carson seems trying think analogous situations roughly analogous situations that would probably consequence adoption theory great many trebledamage cases right across boards confine case left shoe right shoe shoe machinery particular situation how market exclusion cases say access particular product particular market denied i trying reason hypothetical case sort accepting theory respect damages well i afraid mind mind courts we cannot decide case vacuum it might nice could cant that mind whether attempted answer i asked questions stated response and suggesting give way in context record appears page 123 following

review 1447d applicable district courts discretionary decision decline exercise supplemental jurisdiction in case district court dismissed respondents federal rico claim district court remanded remaining state law claims 1367c that remand based upon lack subject matter jurisdiction jurisdiction specifically conferred upon court 1367a its rule 30 years bar 1447d limited specific grounds set forth 1447c and reference statutes page 2 3 petitioners blue brief those two grounds remand thats based upon lack subject matter jurisdiction remand based upon defect lack subject matter jurisdiction raised timely motion remand filed within 30 days notice removal the prong 1447c thats applicable case whether remand one thats based upon lack subject matter jurisdiction now congress clearly conferred jurisdiction district courts 1367a case contains federal claim related state law claims remand based upon courts discretion decline exercise supplemental jurisdiction remand thats based upon courts lack subject matter jurisdiction jurisdiction either exists a district courts power hear case power decline exercise jurisdiction part parcel thing absent power hear case district court cannot decline exercise  cannot exercise discretion decline exercise jurisdiction now  courts osborn v haley case made reference back carnegiemellon also united mine workers v gibbs even state law claims remaining case federal claim resolved district court discretion consistent article iii retain jurisdiction cause action now inconsistent federal circuits analysis case remand based upon 1367c remand based upon lack subject matter jurisdiction view independent basis jurisdiction lacking justice ginsburg i agree court say i remanding either rightly wrongly i lack subject matter jurisdiction would fall squarely within 1447c i agree justice ginsburg that seems rather confusing i would address answer way the review ban 1447d arose situations apparently congress wanted  inhibit abuse seeking delay case filing motion remand for example case filed state court clearly expresses federal question diversity issue yet defendant order delay case remove federal court in situations congress wants prevent kinds frivolous removals federal court but particular case  maybe  let back minute maybe look different way even though may legitimate basis removing case federal court district court disagrees perhaps better policy types remands reviewable even though sometimes district court going get wrong but particular case federal rico claim asserted us state court defendant removing case frivolous basis we removing entitled federal court it district judge dismissed federal rico count  motion remand case filed respondents  district court sua sponte decided going exercise power hear case thought legitimate state law claims remanded basis now thats discretionary remand normally would arguing discretion exercised district court reviewable abuse discretion im sure number  percentage cases  going decision appellate court say shouldnt interfere justice ginsburg i think justice ginsburg i give answer recent case thats brief brookshire case fifth circuit district court exercised jurisdiction federal supplemental claims quite ruled number dispositive motions basically eve trial resolving federal claim remanded back state court the fifth circuit ability review statutory construction able review basis abuse discretion said district court definitely abused discretion after retaining jurisdiction length time returning state court waste judicial resources that true this case different  district court labeled legitimate state law claims example inventorship argued within exclusive jurisdiction federal court appealed federal circuit order issue resolved here went back state court would position argue state court state court lacked jurisdiction hear claim something within exclusive jurisdiction federal court it seems particular situation would better federal circuit pass upon exclusivity inventorship issue patent laws rather go back state court work back state court system resolved it became federal question view arose patent laws filed complaint even though couched terms purely state law claims allege falsely claimed inventors basis claim falsely claimed inventors oath declaration filed connection patent applications us patent trademark office so raising issue respect ability claim inventors claimed us patent applications therefore since falls squarely entitlement  inventorship claim inventors article i section 8 seemed us that clearly fell within exclusive jurisdiction federal court yes if read 1447d face thats seems says that would going rule set thermtron 1447d limited specified grounds 1447c lack im sure would simple solution case justice stevens reason  court decides return areas total chaos could really break reason would situation district courts  dress language lack subject matter jurisdiction remand cases knowing going review if read 1447d plainly face without that exact holding thermtron going construe woodenly allow district court abdicate mandatory jurisdiction mr chief justice could again im sure would divide big things picayune things but i think answer question 30 years particular rule thermtron uniformly applied circuit courts appeal found workable statutory interpretation give framework handle kinds cases and situation circuit courts appeal run away situations like remands based upon declining exercise discretionary power send back state court they seemed want work within statutory framework review kinds cases and i think would large departure go back try modify circuit courts appeal except maybe federal circuit adopted workable framework order solve kinds problems thats correct justice ginsburg and yet yes quackenbush we would overthrow well reason quackenbush remand based upon abstention  abstentionbased remand burford case court found abstentionbased remands fall within either prong 1447c so  fact court gave little attention quackenbush moved 1291 issue yes say im sure  expressly said overrule thermtron strong suggestion brief perhaps given fact congress twice amended 1447c thermtron seems actually ratified courts statutory construction thermtron agreed no mr chief justice wanted get rid thermtron could done direct way i cant suggest court might finally decide say  circuit courts appeal uniformly applied they seem actually mr chief justice going next point federal circuit  provide workable framework dealing issues seems large departure go back wipe last 30 years case law developed handle issues it would large departure if theres questions ill reserve remainder time rebuttal well mr chief justice  sorry  justice stevens would exception thermtron doesnt seem called way interpreted  way even amendments 88 96  barred lack subject matter jurisdiction plainly discretionary remand basis well i think  problem whole doctrine  supplemental jurisdiction first laid carnegiemellon united mine workers difference remands 1367c seem overlap remands 1447d 1441 so made exception pulled 1447d  im sure consequences would i quick points id like bring first i would like reiterate congress enacted 1367 gave article iii jurisdiction matters 1331 1332 i would also like reiterate  stare decisis maintained statutory interpretation proved workable rather workable again circuit courts  even though mr chief justice iterated follow found workable framework and court expressed powerex agree quackenbush thermtron altered and congress  seemingly ratified courts interpretation thermtron applied quackenbush my response mr chief justice court decides abuse discretion district court jurisdiction 1367c either exercise power exercise power and unless theres questions i ask  remanded federal circuit decide merits appeal,637.0,823,27,well hear argument next case 071437 carlsbad technology v hif bio inc mr rhodes isnt something odd saying really fundamental like presence absence subject matter jurisdiction reviewable its disputed right that district court says i lack subject matter jurisdiction lets say rico claim wrong might would reviewable right though could grave error yet matter discretion that would reviewable and i appreciate statutory argument seems odd think congress would want firm  remand lack subject matter jurisdiction wrong right review discretionary exercise  i could keep i choose  that reviewable that doesnt make whole lot sense say judge could keep remand that action reviewable action saying i dont jurisdiction indeed court jurisdiction totally immune review but wouldnt  i mean district judge said i got rid rico claim thats left state law claims theres federal interest case anymore theyre state law claims belong state court goodbye i could keep i choose isnt sound use resources federal court now even youre right discretionary decision cant say jurisdiction discretion implies power isnt 99 cases 100 court appeals assuming reviewability say defer district judges questions nature district judges decision isnt worth time federal court but wouldnt  practical judgment federal claim gone pendent jurisdiction  supplemental jurisdiction  state claim district court told congress its call matter discretion and judge gives one reasons thats enumerated reason state claims overwhelming case rico claim dismissed thinking worthless state case why would court appeals overturn judgment but  youd would retread ground state court already covered federal court thats kind case presented i know case lingered long time processing state law claims the judge concentrated rico threw said rest claims im interested so case like fifth circuit large investment federal court energy time sending back would mean going already transpired federal court could explain federal question its dispute ownership invention right so question validity patent infringement patent its invention like res two parties disputing ownership why  become federal case may i ask one sort preliminary question if applied plain language 1447d case properly remanded  remand order subject review is correct what really prevents us reaching decision case because actually open question arguing certainly disagree why couldnt simply say particular category remand orders well apply plain language 1447d i understand it would modification dicta thermtron wouldnt simple solution case no that wouldnt  wouldnt avoid plain language statute pretextual district court orders wouldnt avoid plain language statute but thered need dress anything i mean thats justice stevenss point you wouldnt dress anything send back reviewable how could light thermtron thermtron went clear text statute says remands reviewable period thermtron court said yes sometimes think outrageous district judge say yes ive got jurisdiction case docket crowded  smallchange case belongs state court the court i think outraged district court thinking could dump case simply busy important things that  setting thermtron reach result court reached court go language statute  read absolute terms but anyway court gave rationale new test going it longer going remands longer  remands reviewable going  applies cases  subsections c 1447 that   court read statute say less fact thats thermtron well woodenly bit much i mean theyre going read say says and thermtron involved court saying im going take im busy things i mean could limited unusual situation couldnt i think would solve problem justice ginsburg pointed earlier way dont get appeal big things like subject matter jurisdiction get appeal picayune things well  one clear way would overrule thermtron neither party asked you havent asked side hasnt asked you distinguish thermtron you dont overrule it still applies facts thats different problem when judge says im busy hear im going send back state court thats thermtron resolved and  thats involved but concern courts reasoning could apply courts reasoning interpretation 1447 you get rid quackenbush dont throw overboard you thought respondents asked us overrule thermtron on page 22 say respondents implicit request court overrule thermtron rejected  well isnt  isnt also case congress amended relevant provisions 1447 since thermtron seen fit overrule change provisions so gets lot attention across street the reviewability remand orders gets  laughter i mean one provisions said technical amendments theyre technical amendments doesnt mean look approve whole thing well thats right want get rid laughter well dont choice right they cant say i dont like supreme court rule im going apply federal circuit laughter let make one comment large departure would large departure said narrow category cases remand basis  district judge doesnt want exercise supplementary jurisdiction state law claims thats appealable period just say thats slight exception thermtron theyre amendments subsection subsection language really reads right case thank counsel mr allison i suppose though would abuse discretion district court retain jurisdiction maybe  never jurisdiction right you said discretion exercise well turns dont discretion exercise  know huge state claim tiny federal claim  wouldnt properly regarded absence jurisdiction thank counsel the case submitted,1176.0,1557,11,mr chief justice may please court let begin petitioners counsels last remark dont know consequences would except know applying review bar supplemental jurisdiction remands would bring us closer achieving purpose expressed statutes congress since 1887 i know court familiar late chief justice rehnquists dissenting opinion associate justice thermtron case justice rehnquist time wrote cases since review bar put place 1887  cases exceptions review recognized he believed plenary bar review justice ginsburg  dissenting opinion 1976 certainly would cite authoritative except confidence justice rehnquists review law existed time that  correct justice ginsburg and fact harken earlier question your honors earlier question asking thermtron overruled i think effect updated the court thermtron give rationale rationale gave viewed  opinion court justice white  viewed 1447c sole source federal remand power and court noticed ensuing 30 40  excuse  yes 40odd years number sources remand power recognized and see reason holding thermtron overruled updated recognize  spirit court held case would served would harmonized review bar existed lo 120 oddyears would served expanding  excuse contracting reach thermtron simply 1447c remands remand authorized statute its  essential question justice souter and i think way harmonize say thermtron indeed pared back courts subsequent decisions and course second argument court something rule thermtron our primary argument gets question statutory language whether cohill remand falls within but secondary argument say certainly well recognized cohill disapproved pared portion thermtron held remand power remand power expressed 1447c in  later case quackenbush question whether mandamus appeal appropriate vehicle challenging remand orders and case court said  disavowing thermtrons sweeping statement mandamus vehicle challenging remand order indeed court and suggest  suggestion brief court might wish look ensuing history since thermtron make similar limiting statement recognizes lot remand authority established since thermtron number statutes course  courts holding cohill well indeed things remembered court considering whether 1447  whether 1447s review bar applied remand 1452 1452 another statute deals remands context cases associated bankruptcy issues and case remand failing follow removal procedure court held citing  citing rice united states versus rice based congresss awareness universality review ban another statute comes place provides remand review bar applies whether  course its little bit  justice ginsburg little bit different courts decision osborn much specific westfall act provision held prevail 1447 in things remembered simply fact review bar held apply remand even according  another statute course recognizing statutory bases remand the interesting thing 1452  justice ginsburg i believe wrote concurrence  1452 provides remand equitable ground remands subject review appeal otherwise so 1452 expresses i think trend thinking congress thing thinking congress  review bar expanded even include discretionary decisions district court equitable ground yes that that true federal circuit said  meant said powerex made question precedential because certainly things remembered decided issue thats court today i think issue wouldnt court today and course but thermtron  thermtron issue really second argument  gentle argument court  court certainly wishes continue discussing that  profitable today but first argument harkening back original questions justice ginsburg shouldnt remand state law claims remain case cohill 1367c 3  come within language 1447c ill call jurisdictional clause clearly matter concern state courts and i think court united mine workers v gibbs made clear state  federal claims left case state law claims remain almost presumptive sent back thats true justice stevens that argument i think whats important argument inconsistency sets it essentially casts net draws supplemental jurisdiction cases and net allows courts appeals review artful pleading issues essentially we state law claims opponents suggesting fact disguised federal claims must heard federal court yes the rico claim  gave district court jurisdiction case first place and interesting  district courts decision made think  made think little bit waco case district courts decision district court clearly said first i jurisdiction state law claims im going remand i turn rico claim creates conundrum im sure yes justice ginsburg thats didnt  didnt press point i think  i think even see court exercised jurisdiction decide dismiss rico claim although reminiscent   decision kircher right well justice ginsburg i made every effort conflate two  two concepts fact say  court acquires supplemental jurisdiction case that species subject matter jurisdiction at point  court held city chicago v international college surgeons at point court mandatory discretion  mandatory jurisdiction exercise power entire article iii case but argue federal claims leave case jurisdiction changes that jurisdiction changes mandatory one court thermtron would certainly concerned district court abjured jurisdiction thats mandatory but changes operation 1367 mandatory discretionary and congress passed 1367 1990 congress intended codify existing law right cohill subject supplemental jurisdiction combining ancillary pendent yes mr chief justice there  indeed jurisdiction and argue nature change goes mandatory concern thermtron discretionary gives  virtually pushes federal court state courts anytime trial  nature jurisdiction changes believe that congress intended words 1447c so come back words statute words statute construed broadly order serve purposes  remand the court made clear concerns comity federalism say construe 1447 favor remand i believe that extend concept whole delay shuttling it  difficult  difficult conundrum i think maybe conundra difficult one particularly and justice ginsburg opinion wrote court arbaugh case clearly pointed word jurisdiction used variety ways legal scholars that  correct thats  nature  thats nature problems court confronted kircher powerex again analogy we concerned  labels like district court believed remanding case lacked jurisdiction but im coming back subject matter jurisdiction i found case court given definition  city chicago mandatory language closest i able find the koffski case seventh circuit one case i able find higher court said supplemental jurisdiction technically form subject matter jurisdiction and argue in  certainly i think   textbook sense subject matter  world divided subject matter personal third territorial i think relation  relation personal  world divided along lines subject matter takes broadest possible meaning conflicting broad policies on one hand broad definition subject matter definition hand statute construed favor remand almost lawful costs and  subject matter step back  dichotomy personal subject matter subject matter also means  your honor said beginning argument something  subject federal courts concerned expend resources and circuit courts hearing appeals decisions  discretionary decisions technically within realm subject matter jurisdiction but clearly state law claims subject matter federal courts routinely concerned thats united mine workers  cohill echoed  said claims sent back cohill even  cases even said propriety remanding claims reviewed every stage litigation that  i think presents us pretty strong policy court remand indulged almost lawful cost yes the  argument  i attempting make technical argument brief i think today im speaking slightly global terms  technical argument district court makes decision words gibbs would inappropriate exercise jurisdiction claims claims remanded well justice alito question whether changes mind i think intricately bound question reviewability cases found  talked reconsideration talked reconsideration potential review orders i think norm remanded case order remand entered order remand certified mailed state court district court longer jurisdiction point now certainly could reconsider engaged decision process it could go back forth reconsider signs order but thats different  many cases court make discretionary decision jurisdiction the and i think  i think  purpose review bar expressed hundred years trust district judges make decisions get case needs be resolved merits so say court chooses hear case  suggests something little bit less gray decision i believe court would make decides inappropriate hear case words gibbs i  i meant suggest  choice its  illconsidered choice certainly theres choice involved decision would inappropriate but i dont see  i  i wanted resist rhetorical question i dont see anyone could say court faced  statelaw claims could either decide decides would inappropriate retain jurisdiction claims somehow retain jurisdiction claims i believe  well   mechanical argument i believe court makes decision  executes remand that divesting jurisdiction and perhaps  perhaps poor  poor word choice it simply question i think  choice word divest means i would  i would analogize order perhaps make seem  accurate  i would analogize district court section 1447e makes decision applying law using discretion allow joinder nondiverse party would destroy diversity require case remanded and i would say case court makes decision divests jurisdiction technical say  yes lacks jurisdiction soon enters order admitting party case but may well order remands case state court but i  i  i see power and case going turn power court  language powerex suggested might i dont know  i dont know make much headway but i  i  i see 1447c lacks subject matter jurisdiction broad enough comfortably take situation statelaw claims really within subject matter district courts power determined inappropriate court hear sent back and would bring us much closer realizing purpose review bar existed since 1887 taking category cases jurisdiction circuit courts i  i wanted offer court statistics maybe law professors might number cases heard type appeal i say cases found footnotes 18 20 represent something close universe cases discretion found abused and abuse discretion nowhere near egregious legal errors district court might commit making erroneous judgments jurisdiction nonetheless subjected review bar kircher powerex if questions i stop thank you,559.0,640,11,but dissenting opinion many years ago how many years but majority rationale says although 1447d reads absolute terms fact remands  covers based defect removal lack subject matter jurisdiction so cant  cant say well thermtron result limit thermtrons unusual facts court gave rationale i mean courts give reasons and court drastically limited 1447d said 1447d read consonant 1447c 1447c deals two kinds remands one defective removal lack subject matter jurisdiction okay but matter  matter adjective verb use thats overruling clear rule thermtron and normally operate theory conventional statute construed court stays construed congress changes and i dont  i dont see follow line reasoning youre proposing even though talk updating harmonizing without violating basic stare decisis rule we  disavow relationship c what addition civil rights provision then thats specific statute would prevail general provision but things remembered i think raised carefully say question thats court decided precise question discretionary remand so i think  i looked things remembered turned i remembered  laughter neutral colorless it said havent confronted issue and i think powerex said thing although said definite terms  far clear yes opponents argument  claims remain include federal claim what ruling rico claim that clearly federal issue where  maybe district judge didnt say maybe point place but say flatly wrong  thats supplemental jurisdiction its says jurisdiction its huge difference jurisdiction powerless power to exercise it  wasnt discretionary decision rico rico  federal claim stated thats what district court jurisdiction supplemental claims choose exercise say i dont jurisdiction congress given supplemental jurisdiction left court remand stated conditions but  seem conflate absence subject matter jurisdiction discretionary decision exercise subject matter jurisdiction court undoubtedly so idea jurisdiction federal claims fall theres jurisdiction okay seems to echo fundamental misperception federal jurisdiction based particular event  lets say youre dumping chemicals water gives federal cause action federal jurisdiction theres trial it turns werent dumping chemicals  dont say jurisdiction jurisdiction finding made facts didnt support jurisdiction you say jurisdiction time lose but  using label subject matter jurisdiction way seems many categories could ambiguous edges subject matter jurisdiction subject matter jurisdiction means court power period theres diversity theres federal question theres basis federal court exercise jurisdiction and say well extend label subject matter jurisdiction include case district court chooses hear certain claims even though jurisdiction i think   misapplication notion subject matter jurisdiction yes subject matter jurisdiction jurisdiction personal jurisdiction subject matter jurisdiction what i arbaugh explain kinds things like time limits sue labeled jurisdictional mandatory fact they simply statutes limitation why technical it says court exercise power subject matter jurisdiction power court hear given controversy supplemental jurisdiction undoubted power district court hear claims you  put terms brief  i understood position correctly  yes subject matter jurisdiction supplemental claims district court chooses exercise jurisdiction  words used  divests jurisdiction what court changes mind what grants motion reconsideration then reacquires jurisdiction the discretionary but the discretionary decision chooses hear case its  theres discretion theres nothing discretionary saying jurisdiction we jurisdiction means power so  two odds no power yes power choose exercise you  think choosing hear distinguishable decision inappropriate hear well would argue highly deferential standard review respecting district judges determination  hasnt invested time questions shouldnt purely statelaw questions thats  thats something quite different    terminology used troublesome court doesnt power divest jurisdiction if congress gives jurisdiction it court cant divest it congress permits decline exercise jurisdiction court capable divesting jurisdiction but even  even analysis seems  cart horse  remanding jurisdiction what saying remands loses jurisdiction two distinct categories the  premise declaration jurisdiction premise even argument arise following remand so theres way fit it seems category  remanding point deciding remand jurisdiction that fact false thank counsel thank mr rhodes four minutes

case involves whether board airport commissioners legally restricted uses terminal facilities intended airport related purposes whether must allow jews jesus others use facilities particular nonairportrelated activities the determinative issues case whether interiors terminal facilities los angeles international airport public forums nonpublic forums that issue determinative defines standard applied reviewing boards policy limiting uses terminal facilities yes board airport commissioners it binding without city council approval it criminal penalty associated without city council approval so rule no presented city council the board airport commissioners power ability adopt rules regulations regarding use airport they cannot adopt criminal penalties no i dont believe under california constitutional law i believe tracks closely federal law case there distinctions in case indication owner property ever attempted restrict uses terminal facilities in addition yes argued neither court addressed issues yes yes it enforced standpoint police officers informed people requested people leave people left the police officers escorted people buildings onto sidewalks they prosecuted the challenge case district court hearing board continued enforcing policy however constitutionality decided city attorneys office taken injunctive action people violated policy yes i believe determinative issue public forum issue excuse im sorry i dont believe issue i believe matters airportrelated matters matters board could determine airport related the christian science reading room sounds bad however issue regard resolution name tenant purpose activity theyre conducting within terminal buildings if christian science reading room merely religious activity provide airport related activity would permitted if united airlines wished conduct nonairportrelated activity would permitted if find viewpoint discrimination board picked improperly decided activity airport related fact isnt i believe resolution enforced remedied situation yes i believe no the lower district court found airport terminal facilities public forums they specifically indicate traditional otherwise the ninth circuit thats correct they found traditional public forum yes could there room case however i believe necessary reach i believe nonpublicforum issue determinative there question speech occurs within terminal and question information boards things like again activities whether speech nonspeech airport related necessary operation airport to allow information long board limits information needed travelling public travels i believe airport related permissible nonpublic forum thats true the test airport related board determined aids travelling public travels the board not absolutely necessary clearly would possible operate airline terminal without food it necessary board airplane the reading room provides waiting area waiting area terminal facilities its little different location someone airport paying people read magazines reading room waiting rooms absolutely i believe reading literature would however activity passing i think different board airport commissioners determined certain amount space within terminal devoted loading gates certain amount newstands certain amount well board airport commissioners decide literature made available within terminals that concessionaire lessee terminal leased space purpose clearly could come us and clearly could lease space like christian science reading room willing provide waiting area hand pamphlets if providing airport related service waiting area could leased space like anyone else could easily thats correct they may well wish read theyre welcome bring terminals read terminals anywhere airport absolutely the news gift concession fixed locations board decided appropriate no nonairportrelated activities absolutely conversation prohibited the activities conducted within terminal facilities board trying prohibit the board limitation persons speech saying speech i dont believe would problem i believe conversations problem if someone hold rally 200 people i believe would activity would airport related would violation no i believe could give congressman piece paper of course the ordinance adopted board airport commissioners choice operate facility assuming traditional public forum they could limit official business airport could open facility types activities adopt time place manner restriction they chose former option limit official business airport granted activities occur within facility individuals directly airport related but activities occur every building and mere fact activities every building would public forum every government building it record standpoint city stipulated jews jesus individual brought lawsuit interfering travelling public grabbing onto anybody however offensiveness activity i dont believe issue the real issue board exercise option reserve facility activities directly aid travelling public travel excuse nothing wrong because trying control uses interiors terminal facilities the mere fact wrong mean airport related best use terminal facilities i believe board right limit use facilities intended dedicated purposes absolutely because i believe would discriminatory the people no i dont believe singled one group people what tried define absolutely the jews jesus welcome use facilities travel purposes theyre welcome passenger theyre welcome come lease space long activity wish 0 xxx im sorry yes we they conducting literature distribution they generally coming airport they conducting activity i dont know would prohibited the board they conducting literature distribution activity within terminal it occasional occurrence its somebody passing terminal travels handing somebody another piece paper they airport purpose theyre generally sightsee they conducting nonairportrelated activity theyre trying achieve particular objective and board tried limit airport that correct i believe earlier resolution whereas clauses refers accommodating air commerce air navigational by resolution however resolution something new the resolution came order address interaction protected activities boards longstanding policies limiting airport intended purposes the airport number requests wide variety people the people ignored boards policy claiming right ignore policy first amendment therefore resolution directly address and reaffirmed policy no i believe would violate the board denied yes i believe thats closer question but yes i believe board would find campaigning would violate i dont believe would violate you first amendment right the resolution doesnt focus first amendment prohibiting the resolution allows first amendment activities sidewalk area nonairportrelated commercial activities would permitted sidewalk areas exteriors the board addressed interaction first amendment protected activities policy allowing activities occur sidewalks other nonairportrelated activities permitted occur sidewalk outside terminal facilities yes if problems overbreadth problems would come terms determining first amendment activities would allowed sidewalk areas would would permitted sidewalk areas i dont believe overbreadth problems regard airportrelated activities there attempt define first amendment activities within resolution there attempt define airportrelated activities the board airport commissioners prohibited speech within terminals i think impractical think could i believe resolution says interiors airport limited airport purposes yes i identified activities protected thats correct speech protected activity speech happens occurs every public building i dont believe fact speech occurs people read newspapers within building requires government open building types expressive activities that correct i think public forum nonpublic forum issue definitely issue the ninth circuit court appeals respondents claimed interiors traditional public forums therefore types speech restricted time place manner restriction theyve cited among things theres unrestricted public access terminals fact people read converse terminals they also claim sort preferential treatment commercial activities commercial speech limited context permitted terminals these arguments i believe fail recognize nature purpose lax airportrelated purposes also fails recognize government right reserve facilities control official business the commercial activities commercial speech occurs within terminals airport related although thats issue i think i think board would right i think precedent i believe certain cases like greef v spock forth would support the board done i believe theyve attempted show sensitivity first amendment activities permitting within airport excuse sidewalk areas outside interiors i would like save minutes i believe theres argument could made airport integrated open streets parks municipality sidewalk areas inside terminal areas even though exterior sidewalks identical involved us v grace so therefore i believe board would power i dont believe i believe boards policy yes with regard airport property right adopt rules regulations absolutely everything surrounding terminals yes yes i believe stipulated facts approximately number 8 9 i would like reserve minutes i may thank much made presence solicitors within terminals ten years the thing shows board appropriate tools keep people enforce policy they yes part problem many laws criminal laws drafted cover many pieces property within los angeles here board people charged operating airport making determinations rules apply regard this court repeatedly stated government entity power preserve property control uses theyre lawfully dedicated this board attempted said constitutionally permissible and request find airport traditional public forum opened public forum thank you,725.0,1062,81,we hear arguments first morning no 86104 board airport commissioners city los angeles versus jews jesus others mr kapel may proceed whenever youre ready mr kapel may i ask preliminary question two there resolution passed airport board whatever called was resolution binding without city council approval has city council ever approved fact and another preliminary inquiry would airport public forum california constitutional law how hoffman case making railroad terminal public forum was state law point argued courts thank may i ask question proceed mr kapel has ordinance ever enforced anyone specifically when people left prosecuted so facial challenge that means i take disagree public disagree public forum result accrue suppose worried allegations unequal enforcement suppose worried allegations unequal enforcement christian science reading room example advertisement environmental matters alleged airport that issue us what im asking reach suppose find want us find this public forum suppose also concerned rules first amendment activity applied evenhandedly what disposition and make determination did lower court base decision part so wouldnt ninth circuit so worried matters could remand let decide whether theres unequal enforcement couldnt counsel position one nothing either traditional public forum do room court recognized cases limited public forum status of course presented nothing way evidence counterbalance thing it seems youre taking nothing position and lose maybe cant take intermediate way done cases may i ask said airport related said things needed traveller you dont define airport related terms necessity everything absolutely necessary traveller you dont need christian science reading room maybe helps test but necessary traveller and without christian science reading room however something like reading room provides place sit youre waiting planes maybe obtain peace mind get storm something like wouldnt literature passed people perhaps serve airport related function well read newspapers something pass time occupy traveller perhaps give peace mind why wouldnt reading literature people pass airport related sense reading newspaper well different passing offering sale news vendor well could they consistently general policy decide good health literature help passenger comfortable theres thunderstorm something ought set aside area 10 square feet let booth pass like christian science people pass mary baker eddys writings no i understand but wouldnt consistent policy couldnt come im suggesting must could consistently policy said think good literature would helpful passengers read instead time magazine science health whatever else might yes keep going waiting area but isnt reading activity newspaper offered isnt also airport related sense something traveller wants why isnt equally conceivable travellers might want read literature jews jesus are news people allowed hawk newspapers walking around terminal selling but isnt ordinance reads i mean isnt limitation the limitation isnt conduct first amendment activities walking around terminal what specifically prohibited so im congressman flying washington hawaii i transfer planes los angeles i make appointment aide talk national issues i say lets meet inside airport want talk pros cons national issues thats violation ordinance speech activity what activity suppose representatives jews jesus stand nothing speak dont even pass anything speak way i would speaking congressman oh really its passing literature thats problem i couldnt give congressman piece paper i could talk came well isnt ordinance designed part prevent obstruction passage people along concourses way planes coming planes is anything record show exactly like grab hold arm dont let walk stand front move is record  what wrong people well prohibit something doesnt anything wrong well right stop could stop redheaded people using why well isnt discriminatory youre singling one group people you singled people dont want use facilities are welcome come visit stand well if theyre standing holding book saying nothing else prohibited well mr kapel may i go back second the resolution uses term prohibits first amendment activities and doesnt use term airport related activities or i wrong i see but prohibited resolution quote first amendment activities unquote i think isnt right the resolution correct but conduct prohibited resolution quote first amendment activities unquote i read of individual engages first amendment activities forth hes directed city attorney institute appropriate litigation but ordinance define term resolution define term first amendment activities does mean example one people wore carried sign say sandwich know one wooden signs said jews jesus whatever message might would that would violate i suppose and i take political candidate came said vote joe smith carried banner something like that would violate so would spoke loud went around shaking hands people that would resolution candidate so basically whatever first amendment protects resolution prohibits its reads what i turn person next say good morning i dont first amendment right turn person next say good morning now let sure i understand the sidewalk refer external sidewalk if want united american outside take bus thats okay but walk internal walk half mile alleys thats prohibited isnt thats part sidewalk you know i guess talking overbreadth problems thats basis court went but dont see problems overbreadth banning first amendment activity well clearly i mean language resolution simple it says central terminal area open first amendment activities individual entity and covers good morning person next literal terms there absolutely attempt define resolution 0 xxx i mean resolution says i dont well answers questions youve identified first amendment activities forbidden forbidden interpret ordinance some first amendment activities first amendment activities arent but havent banned havent banned types i mean thats problem if read youve banned types but maybe point thats whats us that thats overbreadth problem us decision says public forum allow types and even werent overbroad would good is thats i thought may i ask one question some airports front airport covered area youre sheltered rain may even kind like tunnel drive supposing airport decided make sidewalks outside part airport appropriate constructive devices decided extend ban outside sidewalks outside sidewalks well i suppose theory would could couldnt and could probably include parking lot its big area its devoted airport function driveways everything inside sign says entering los angeles airport whatever you mean outside airport by permitting outside airport well i still dont understand keep saying airport permitted outside they havent blame thing outside theyre great favor letting someplace else am i right wrong do ordinance protect youre taking right well boards policy

terminals public fora the petitioners throughout argument your honor couched argument major airport terminal the designation major really regarding amount people would seek access our position twofold that tradition public forum created yes sidewalk street park well tradition your honor major airports know major recent phenomenon their history limited i think tradition your honor i think twofold the first part tradition analysis could limited history history though first amendment activities central terminal area lax taken place jews jesus distributing religious literature 12 years and history considering length history airport period time substantial we would argue history case one looking transportation centers generally city gates weve argued brief city gates period scripture places people come hear ideas it later moved railroads waterfront airport terminals our position well your honor i think spectrum history starting want start constitution position would course jews jesus would right fact private enterprise were saying places public forums everybody go everywhere first amendment activities the places inn bus terminal rail station places people gathered they become town squares the innkeeper could throw someone innkeeper wasnt government sponsored organization like los angeles international airport i think analogy good but difference no i think historic standpoint access issue i dont think case particular particular case i think looking use facilities places people congregated a different situation far actual private ownership what seeking show visavis analogy scripture ancient city gates going forward airport places people congregated yes i mean thats correct your honor in private terminal would correct im expert area i dont know fact privately owned however excuse your honor absolutely i your honor where people stood around your honor fact lot people particular forum evidence importance particular places available public access dissemination case religious literature it concentration people i think evidence need your honor phrase issue phrased airports traditional public forum phrased issue position would access youre

public clear anyone record shows enter lax purposes travelrelatedness so could go airport reason not city made much limitations contained charter however careful reading charter shows facility limited airport related activities whatever means theres definition leases entered reasons airport related activities in fact revocable permits issued purposes interfere efficient operation facility your honor something obviously i pondered i walked that brings interesting point our position would certainly position would line public forum analogy stops however im convinced plaza level appropriate place clearly sidewalks court held public forum i say arguments enter facility negate towards public forum concept however plaza i think arguments could made area public access certainly one could constitute public forum whether fact im applying absolutely your honor goes tradition course open lets spend moment tradition the tradition tradition access communication purposes communicating activities taken place lax since least 1974 well based knowledge plaza courthouse i think communication communicating activities taken place presumption area open which brings how bring history your honor government authority says no your honor precisely contrary that history existed people people distributed literature streets sidewalks your honor laws 1789 seditions act said basically dont distribute literature those challenged i would take position your honor again specifying date handing well ill best activities quote even recent activities government policy activities took place activities published criminal activities i dont recall exact place your honor i know yes absolutely the point im making that history exists case fact los angeles international airport opened facility the charter doesnt prohibit facts case show fact happened first amendment activities taken place lax the petitioners even today conceded place limited public forum thats completely contrary position theyve taken thus far yes your honor yes your honor in district court arguments regarding california law liberty free speech argued extensively thats correct your honor they dealt federal our position would hoffman your honor cited earlier would stand proposition first amendment activities would appropriate however would also assert federal constitution course activities yes your honor would take position weve limited weve pointed brief inexplicably nothing state district courts opinion us district courts opinion regarding california constitution it argued it briefs the opinion contain response it merely found airport terminal line cases district yes your honor our argument public forum issue we argued overbreadth vagueness we also got contentbased viewpointbased discrimination analysis well prior restraint the prior restraint analysis utilize petitioners stated today theyve said throughout brief airport related exception the resolution face bans first amendment activities thats face however airport related exception determine theyve stated determine whether somethings airport related theres standards theres guidelines its merely something board discretion decides i think argument certainly could made could go far say absolutely capricious determination made board they guidelines theyve also pointed its before court your honor court facts stipulated parties showing exactly whats taken place lax activities taken place in briefs trial court briefs argued points i would take position court could reach issues viewpoint discrimination regardless your honor im also asking court affirm course traditional public forum absolutely your honor overbroad vagueness contentbased discrimination yes sir under resolution wouldnt newsstand stand because resolution face would ban newspapers sold well it bans first amendment activities whether someone justice scalia earlier said said hello someone wrote piece paper resolution would resolution would allow it wouldnt airport related yes your honor the question would would activity substantially interfere flow traffic thats legitimate concern our position would fact situation traffic impeded reasonable regulation time place manner could handle our position would newspaper stand officer operator said yes could could distribute literature protected activity first amendment and resolution unconstitutional face when get weighing whether something affects usage overall thats different different situation the important another important aspect case existence first amendment activities central terminal area lax there christian science reading room we accept position christian science reading room waiting room the record doesnt say many seats many seats could put amount space the record say however material available christian science reading room regards christian science faith no honor your honor would take position your honor position first amendment activity something would pay one purposes public forum doctrine giving groups may less popular messages not cost your honor context the material disseminated christian science reading room regarding christian science faith effectively took looking establishment clause analysis activity allowed exist im saying thats know theres technical establishment problem were saying existence reading room causes establishment problem our position existence reading room denying jews jesus right distribute literature would violation first amendment rights well courts dealt when youre dealing assemblage people reasonable time place manner restrictions would come your honor however jews jesus outside methodist church distributing literatures passersby certainly would constitutionally protected even though methodist church owns facility if sidewalk public property distributing literature im talking church service well i hope were saying distribution literature christian science christian science reading room allowing activity take place denying jews jesus right disseminate religious literature inside central terminal area messages first amendment purposes the fact one leases space one would position that would basically irrelevant publicly owned facility what opinion viewpoint discrimination the issue exists thing one walks airport terminal made aware resolution doesnt even know resolution says it says first amendment activity banned theres exception somewhere recitals mr kapel pointed that exception creates whole list problems who decides somethings airport related the board how decide they decide theres standards guidelines set forth wherein make determination another position weve taken situation existence limited open public forum the activities jews jesus religious political social organizations taken place central terminal area lax theyve taken place least 12 years the petitioners made much fact groups denied access first would say groups may denied access groups done first activities furthermore nothing record showing groups denied access for know reason denied could one legitimate concerns the activities going take place would inappropriate airport facility so dispositive opinion dispositive issue that point i making your honor theres nothing record shows denied saying people denied effectively people exercised first amendment activities inside central terminal area opinion shows compatible your honor one important element analysis compatibility issue theres general access open public and lets take office building good example office building narrow quarters there an argument made activities taking place inside office building may compatible may compatible efficient operation particular facility but general public access coupled compatibility thats correct a nonpublic forum arguments made regarding nonpublic forum concerning internal mail school systems its public access lacking your honor particular situation many others there also cases like greer v spock there special functions facilities military bases special constitutional function court determined special constitutional function justifies concern national security justifies national defense regulation elimination cases first amendment activities taking place were saying facilities public forums open everyone what saying compatibility general public access saying part key that compatibility access thats balancing the public forum issue spectrum our position lax spectrum public forum closer street sidewalk park military base prison if fact general public allowed access past security point i think your honor argument made first amendment activities line demarcation stopping point well your honor i would say line and would appropriate place you add factor your honor activities taking place past security point are restaurants shops many times airports theres if cutoff ticketed passengers i would say security concerns outweigh okay your honor particular case i would say reasonable time place manner regulation eliminating area first amendment activities could appropriate event secured area yes based proposition thank your honor the position respondents made concerning openness forum i think legitimate reasons restrict access ticketing areas baggage pickup areas high concentration utilizing rather broad sweeping first amendment activities reasonable time place manner regulation were taking proposition buildings public forums we weighing and weighing compatibility and part compatibility would security issue part compatibility certainly could ticketing baggage things if general public access compatibility position would public forum exist subject special concerns military base prison area general access the courts decisions regarding greer v spock although military base open special constitutional functions and would would your honor position something place activity something think exactly think airports would traditional public forum i dont take position grace government determining factor constitutes public forum nor i take position mere chance history would create public forum increased mobility society matter new architectural designs an excellent point raised airport extended central terminal area sidewalks covered well banned and thats position taking the compatibility important factor the public access important factor the accommodation would take position analysis draw balancing there balancing the balancing would take consideration positions yes your honor,619.0,970,66,you mean generally airport airport thats open public public forum and would say nothing city could could could close to put category public forum so like sidewalk cant how created tradition airport authorities close i mean tradition respect major airports so tradition respect major airports true false what so tradition whats happened past 12 years i thought city gates thing is really think analog city gate or wouldnt analog go back time constitution wouldnt inn coach would stop pick passengers and theyd assemble sit dining room eat piece mutton something were jews jesus allowed inside inns do think they private operations werent no come back place travellers gather use transportation why historically place like city gates theres classic first amendment proselytizing argumentative activity i dont know the innkeeper couldnt throw somebody saying i dont want know politics religion inn we want happy people but traditionally private operation thats point and railroad station traditionally private operation wasnt but whats answer private versus public ownership railroad terminal tradition in railroad terminals and yet theres question people could thrown owners terminals and werent almost railroad terminals privately owned have ever seen station people stand around groups discuss things have ever seen station airport people stand around discuss problems you well get grand central station around 500 oclock youll get run xxx home dinner religion because lot people i mean thats reason because lot people counsel excuse interrupting you agree course airport authority could adopt reasonable time place manner regulations yes right now facts facts case i recall minister jews jesus physically handing literature thats correct assume moment airport adopted resolution permitted type literature type literature example disseminated equivalent newsstand would satisfactory that resolution manner restriction analogous distributing newspapers can think place wouldnt compatible lets say capitol right across lawn couldnt set little booths various groups want pass literature tourists coming would interrupt oh i think wouldnt congress says dont want this building we dont want we could live dont want why cant airport say thats test if number one public area number two wouldnt interfere public purpose substantially activity must allowed well thats vast extension public forum doctrine date seems i thought rule public forum must allow activities extent theyre compatible things occurring public forum but youre converting rule compatible activity public forum you establish public forum first i agree proposition stated does activity interfere primary purpose public forum but establish first public forum thats i thought discussing you mentioned sidewalk front building what plaza front xxx test youre applying you look sky say i thought depends tradition essentially what plaza front courthouse but doesnt trouble thats get history under theory government day one banned discussion streets would tradition public discussion streets therefore streets would fail test well dont know hypothesis whether would done government banned well tell little bit laws challenged 1789 well pin within 40 50 years where somewhere united states mr sekulow suppose disagree court think traditional public forum did argue event california constitution would public forum must open but courts never reached state law question and decided federal constitutional issue would position state law might nevertheless require open well suppose decide federal constitution im trying inquire whether think still open client raise state constitutional issue why shouldnt court decided state issue first let ask one question did argue overbreadth statute thats us though right so decide case though question could lax like capitol promulgate nicely narrowly crafted rule says religious proselytizing grounds right thats issue could lax if public forum couldnt if public forum presumably could putting precisely youre asking us affirm judgment grounds ones relied ninth circuit time yes i mean abandoned overbreadth arguments and think overbroad affirm dont mr sekulow suppose group stood permission newsstand handed inside newsstand would prohibited assuming dont close newsstand could stand middle permission newsstand hand pamphlets well mr sekulow lease space has jews jesus leased space well theyre situation theyre paying lease and presumably could lease space well i understand but avail argue christian science reading room leased space so doesnt support argument least view i dont see well thats like saying methodist church owns property church located preach religious doctrine somebody else doesnt church able street outside hold church service no case ever held yes youre saying anything christian science people leasing want able without leasing and case ever held your honor taking far well dont know either we could certainly leave lower court figure problem mr sekulow would explain i really dont understand argument makes public forum special opposed public building because i understand argument i think boils saying public building must allowed used free speech activities extent activities incompatible uses building now adopt principle need public forum doctrine you dont need doesnt totally gobble concept buildings cannot dont even reasonable time place manner restrictions but even public forum allowed place restrictions necessary make speech compatible whatever else going in park forth so difference public forum nonpublic forum view world could could lax pass rule people cannot go beyond metal detector riding go beyond metal would good rule i said nobody riders could made would made you say could made you know argue buildings cat but i mean would made i want know far go restrict answer question and add thank may i follow justice marshall suppose particular congested area like ticket lines sort thing could also perhaps restrict you taking position theyre public forums general public access the inquiry would make youve determined general public access building whether free speech activities compatible and question whether appropriate isnt necessarily question whether compatible i mean take hypothetical capitol its compatible sense run business booths passing religious literature political literature they could run business anyway but never done this place they said place you would allow said would could i stand stipulations fact record thank mr sekulow mr kapel two minutes

fact crime charged case involved situation two men arrested cincinnati ohio alleged stolen goods shipped interstate commerce taken across ohio river kentucky the next day manchester kentucky city police judge manchester issued search warrant state local officers go store belonged mr knuckles search stolen property the search warrant signed blank judge affidavit signed blank judge district court held search warrant worth paper written quashed search warrant however officers i think unaware whether aware went ahead searched two days man’s store  it quite number inaudible wasnt it’s two big trucks wide it went day saturday afternoon day sunday the court suppressed motion evidence owner store the court held two men arrested cincinnati standing suppress evidence the case tried course evidence seized store admitted evidence two men petitioners case they indicted  yes your honor i think next day yes your honor after goods brought cincinnati word gotten manchester kentucky employees store merchandising company goods taken he came back manchester next day i understand got warrant city judge now men indicted together clinton knuckles also and first count charged conspiracy move goods interstate commerce charge second count simply transporting goods interstate commerce the third count involved defendant now case appealed sixth circuit sixth circuit held among things harmless error committed rulings court bruton violated upheld district court’s ruling men standing suppress evidence now factually that’s case concerned today now i may i would like address question mens standing suppress evidence first now court course aware fact indicted conspiracy charge now goods seized kentucky prove conspiracy could used conspiracy petitioners smith brown could used prove conspiracy coconspirator defendant clinton knuckles you one conspiracy charged three men law conspiracy certainly statement racked coconspirator time conspiracy life conspiracy chargeable conspirators any deed act words spoken coconspirator it’s charged men it’s act it’s statement i don’t think your honor permit i explain i don’t think they pretty strong case stealing warehouse cincinnati if stuff taken store used i think could proven federal case could proven conspiracy now i say reason at trial case court instructed jury must found defendants guilty committed third overt act charged indictment order get case kentucky one overt act according trial committed kentucky otherwise eastern district kentucky would venue case it would improper venue now overt act charged men delivered stolen merchandise stolen cincinnati taken manchester kentucky now court instructed jury effect must  find guilty committing one overt act wouldnt business united states district court now without merchandise gotten  stolen manchester kentucky couldn’t proven wouldn’t venue wouldn’t proven interstate transportation they may gotten stealing state ohio wouldnt interstate violation so point view i don’t think harmless error i think if  i look harmless error manner take evidence suppress evidence take it wouldn’t chance beat case we wouldn’t chance win case now living would chance win wouldnt youre living certainly wouldnt take dont much case i dont know your honor i wouldnt think would make difference really if it’s suppressed evidence excluded excluded say probably purposes if couldnt admit evidence within trial except government would wouldn’t proven venue so i don’t think would really  suppress suppress purposes now i sure court aware  court rendered decisions cases touch well point certainly case jones versus united states simmons versus united states alderman versus united states rule established that man didnt come plain possession something rather standing suppress these either lots premises possessory interest standing now i think case almost precisely important facts case decision rendered july 1971 it came second circuit its united states versus price the facts case  facts case similar ones case situation fellow stole bunch tv sets took hid warehouses place the warehouse possession defendant present search made warehouse second circuit came conclusion man standing suppress evidence ordered opinion remanded case hearing point knowing may establish now sixth circuit course case even price case involved conspiracy also now sixth circuit course taken contrary position they say men standing suppress evidence carlos worked wasnt possessory crime standing suppress now certainly law complied within case the judge police court manchester kentucky signed name piece paper he told county attorney assume maybe city judge small town didnt know better lame told county attorney said go fill i got take wife hospital i think man signed another piece paper affidavit told county attorney go fill county attorney filled affidavit search warrant talked effect purposed effect – enough detail tore another one give officers officer went searched the assistant united states attorney made paper written that true i would like make think distinction frequently reminded  constable bungles felon goes free isnt case this case law officers went engaged illegal search seizure zealous disregarded rights people may acted ignorance this case error committed judicial officer prosecuting attorney known better yes tried twice far he codefendant case standing thats one claim talk court granted evidence knuckles evidence said seized could admitted but could admitted two fellows of course i sure court reasoned couldnt take inaudible introduced evidence admonished jury consider smith brown forget far knuckles concerned i mean mislead court knuckles tried petitioners he tried subsequently succeeding indictment government trying make improvements  first case hung jury second case mistrial second case indictment number two third case indictment number three succeeding indictments two coconspirators named cases but difficult see going prove one conspiracy use different quantities qualities evidence prove different people if three gentleman sitting conspired commit crime bothers think use use evidence two fellows you able take evidence convict three us ought let quality evidence used far us concerned now crime fellows charged i would say possessory crime per se like case man narcotics bird case bird jones case united states could prove case unless showed sometime men two truck loads stuffs possession so i prove possession point prove crime now personally i like conspiracies i mean crime devil defend doesnt take much prove one the government got kinds evidentiary advantages they to prove conspiracy three fellows sat talked violating law plotted little bit prove made one overt act i commit one overt act got us anything says two days fifty miles away used the law plain cases now court spoken several cases effect partnership conspiracy i partnership crime acts statements coconspirator made course conspiracy admissible conspirators conspirators time in trial case court instructed jury effect  well i arguing idea agency conspiracy try reason way i cant courts reason way  thats true i talking man what i talking  no sir i talking fourth amendent well that’s precisely  no sir i talking documents now court instructed jury i referring page 226 appendix court plainly quotes “a conspiracy kind partnership criminal purposes member becomes agent every member” now government use i entitled thing entitled using man now clinton knuckles possession merchandise store seized count search warrant men partners agents joint possession it joint constructive possession certainly logically follows law conspiracies no sir they cincinnati using manchester kentucky well allowable use fiction convict man i use fiction let go well i think law trying trying take concept partnership law apply criminal situation well that’s done several cases your honor i think case  well used sense your honor certainly  well i think your honor  i think governments allowed prosecute case except  with man something ten miles away i charged act he says something ten miles away i charged statement thats conspiracy case partner running filling station selling cattle whatever whatever i bound i think bad fiction i mean i dislike say i think  i think harsh i think – i think law conspiracy i may refer kolowich case concurring opinion justice jackson case conspiracy bad history derived star chamber kinds connotations intrigue besides making inaudible government inaudible things nature well i dont  i dont think anything nature your honor the thing involves far i could see two folks stealing got caught try make conspiracy i dont think merits conspiracy the government used thought making inaudible no one buys another another man columbia make conspiracy thats petty crime it used many trivial things if i may refer simmons case court decided years ago case says court never considered squarely question whether defendants charged nonpossessory crimes like garrett entitled relieved dilemma entirely i think like justice stewart says i think whats sauce goose sauce gander thank no your honor,208.0,243,26,we hear arguments next 716193 brown the united states mr lundy how soon arrest  arrested trucks lot merchandise possession then soon  next day was warrant obtained subsequent time arrested possession goods well sixth circuit sought errors harmless men caught truck possession large amount stolen goods nothing could altered result right you would concede that’s pretty strong case does exclusionary rule apply government attempted prove venue opposed proving elements offense i think everybody would agree one thing case that wholly invalid warrant there issue and i understand government court proceeds premise that invalid warrant was knuckles ever prosecuted he codefendant what result another knuckles trial hung juries cases inaudible but statements issue made conspiracy wasn’t issue what issue as i understood point least brief sort whats sauce goose sauce gander government take advantage conspiracy theory ought advantage holding knuckles part member partnership agent isnt there prearrest statements issue okay thats i asked do – possession store think there fiction involved concept criminal conspiracy isnt whats fiction criminal conspiracy establish people done certain things concert it maybe fiction call partnership anybody i sure puts quotation marks either actually figuratively what cases anything said partnership law term partnership cases used colloquial sense short hand saying criminal conduct acted like partners sense joint venture well never want draw chain law partnership but dont really say government invoked partnership law prosecution on record quite bit intrigue wasnt ever thought mr evans thank gentleman the case submitted,914.0,1222,14,mr chief justice may please court this case presents principally two questions relating application automatic standing rule first whether applies possession charged stolen property second whether applies possession charged possession time time search seizure took place i would argue answer questions the case similar respects clums case last term court disposed without deciding automatic standing issue on day clums decided certiorari granted mr lundy detailed facts in essence petitioners brown smith engaged stealing merchandise central jobbing company cincinnati they transported merchandise across state lines kentucky sold clinton knuckles owner knuckles dollar store two months later final act interstate transportation defective search warrant issued search conducted knuckle store the petitioners charged interstate transportation stolen merchandise conspiracy commit substantive offense motion suppress sought exclude evidence seized knuckles store the courts rejected contentions ground petitioners lacked standing make in view clear facts petitioners standing traditional standing rule that rule requires showing interest either premises searched property seized the petitioners interest premises searched it knuckles stores they never asserted interest premises present time search conducted fact custody ohio arrested previous day nor they interest property seized there proprietary interest property stolen didnt belong there possessory interest parted possession two months earlier in words fourth amendment rights implicated search seizure extent mr lundy argument attacked traditional standing rule i believe recently alderman upheld indefinitively the fourth amendment rights assertable vicariously personal rights exclusionary rule limited circumstances one allege victim unlawful search rather one aggrieved solely introduction evidence seized well question hard one pose i think instances situation partner interest premises searched the issue hard even imagine situation partnership property circumstance invasion premises researched beyond i  i think close question i think argued either side  yes sir when dealing fourth amendment questions i dont think partnership context case i mean i dont think partnership idea really applies even concepts  my answer argument several problems in first instance even assume partnership concepts appropriate traditional common law sense traditional common law rule cannot partnership illegal purpose but even putting aside partnership mr lundys assertions coincident conspiracy the conspiracy ended definition day search made they arrested already given confession statements time search made but event even go way say basis constructive possession theory possession time search made opinion possessory interest stolen property interest fourth amendment designed protect mr justice  i think dealing  stolen car slightly different situation right property interest i would argue i think search could made difference respects car like i mean enclose things within it’s large place almost like house even though  i mean  say trespasser car i would argue car maybe searched regardless that’s right consideration might lead different result  not i know but consideration could brought bear side issue since concerned deterrent fact fourth amendment standing questions could stolen car clear people search  police search stolen cars without might impact deterrent effect fourth amendment well standing petitioners assert fourth amendment claim  i believe  well i think  it stolen property yes that’s right that’s right view interest property i suppose that’s right yes because petitioners lacked traditional stand  standing traditional rule sought invoke automatic rule established jones case jones automatic standing rule narrow exception traditional rule in jones narcotics seized search seizure apartment belonging friend defendant defendant premises he charged various narcotics offenses statutory presumptions permitted conviction showing mere knowing possessions on facts court held first defendant’s lawful presence premises gave sufficient interest premises justify standing challenge reasonableness search premises move suppress fruits now aspect jones case involved everybody agreed petitioners never asserted interest knuckle store the court jones could stopped went considered whether independent jones interest premises searched whether sufficient interest property seized justify standing now course fact jones possessed narcotics accused possessing possessed time seizure made and apparent courts view jones prepared come forward testify possession time seizure would standing traditional rule the problem was position come forward willing come forward testify reason willing come forward testify time substantial risk testimony possession time suppression hearing could used trial part government’s case chief because dilemma defendant faced court ruled need make showing where government indictment already conceded effect could make showing corollary rationale articulated court well contrary holding jones must come forward practical effect would unable come forward would give government benefit inconsistent positions would arguing sense trial defendant possessed narcotics time seized basis charge suppression hearing challenging standing would implicitly saying possession time seizure this court viewed consonant amenities administration criminal justice the first thing said jones respect case unlike jones petitioners standing traditional standing rule as discussed interest knuckle store view interest property seized in view automatic standing rule jones designed solely would otherwise standing traditional rule unable assert standing situation prevailed time respect use testimony suppression testimony subsequent trial because brown smith standing traditional rule think beneficiaries rule designed would standing nor jones rationale compel different  extension jones rationale  well jones rationale compel extension rule facts since standing traditional rule defendants faced dilemma jones faced his dilemma arose testimony would prepared give establish standing could used here dilemma testimony would establish standing testimony  position jones come forward establish well difficult  i believe essence decided alderman least appears i mean ruling stated alderman coconspirators entitled search coconspirators fourth amendment rights thats argument thats made i think answered i dont think precedent vicarious assertion rights even within conspiracy whether call it partnership thats right the  i think principles applied nonetheless well sense john smith rights duffel bag his rights property duffel bag thats right well effects  yes i think mr justice i think instance would difficult argue person invaded interest person i think thats answer the answer i given mr justice rehnquist i believe invasion one wearing even one wearing stolen i would think invasion person i would want to argue side issue yes thats right you mean dont  well my understanding cartons things like mens ladies shoes kind thing i  they didnt go but i dont think would  thats right well i think i indicated  gave possessory interest property two months search made so even come forward make assertion couldnt make mainly possess time search made i think applicable rule circumstances would simmons rule resolves dilemma nonjones context namely testimony gave would able used seems to sensible resolution problem to summarize discussion respect dilemma aspect jones applied think require since dilemma remains point need apply automatic standing rule facts nor think alternative rationale jones requires application rule facts because circumstances inconsistency position government forced take the government must show part case detail brown smith possessed central jobbing company merchandise point possession two months prior time search made the government need deny suppression hearing petitioners one time possession merchandise its wholly consistent position its argument really time search possessory interest justifying fourth amendment protection well alternatively even fourth amendment interest deserved protection even coincident contemporaneous possession possession stolen property possession stolen property merits fourth amendment protection in view therefore reason apply facts rule designed benefit would standing traditional rule constitutional dilemma resolved different way simmons the petitioners seek resolution dilemma face really reaping unintended unnecessary windfall there another issue case involving bruton violation there testimony trial concerning statements made brown smith respects cross inculpatory we conceive error detail brief believe error harmless beyond reasonable doubt unless questions i would propose deal time,323.0,434,32,what traditional conventional kind partnership lets say law partnership something wrongfully seized anyone partners complain fourth amendment for sake partnership say  well lets say im kind thinking loud i agree law offices would lease office building every partner would interest piece real estate but lets say one partners takes something belonging sub partnership home takes home does every partner fourth amendment complaint partners home wrongfully added property seized because rightly wrongly trial judge tell jury partnership used word didnt 226 record but i wondered  way begun arguments absolutely ignored arguments opponents you talked case though another fourth amendment case haven’t – pay attention argument conspiracy case therefore different trial judge didnt view least partnership thats word used you would really argue ran across fellow stolen car  circumstances search car long stolen just it’s stolen getting basis search no property interest just it’s stolen there cases around like does make difference case whether standing you really care long interest store it’s conceded isn’t officers validly right he claim  but respect store lets assume standing assert interest goods legal seizure goods they may standing assert won’t automatically lose its stolen property isn’t the officers probable cause seize don’t they legal they see well legally they entered  no put aside fact illegally enter store respect defendant i gather colleague side conceded wasnt arguing partnership crime gave clients any interest store could assert fourth amendment well even they would lose as  “partners” joint venturers least i understand argument knuckles agent brown smith fourth amendment purposes at least i think thats  there wasnt personal property involved alderman allegedly joint property coconspirator the question one personal perhaps – conversation but end i think wavier fourth amendment right cant i cant remember title case duffel bag case  cupp – frazier  frazier cupp charles said sure go ahead search duffel bag found john smiths effects said john smith  john smiths rights waived owner duffel bag they john smiths duffel bag frazier cupp initially one warden  well man wearing stolen overcoat spin thing one step do think overcoat searched whereas justice whites analogy without grounds search since overcoat stolen man standing object search what stolen person market you would argue i argue within border search case and wouldnt also take position broke searched knuckles place gone materials found might problem didnt go right

grounds reversal case i intend address essentially one the one set really mr cohen’s role i recited earlier that dispute focuses 1959 decision court williams lee that case also involved navajo indians in case nonindian brought suit navajo couple state courts arizona based reservation incurred debt the navajos moved dismiss ground tribal government alone jurisdiction cause action the arizona supreme court denied claim ruling act congress expressly forbad state court jurisdiction the state court must jurisdiction that’s claim arizona makes we renewal dispute in case court reversed unanimously reversed arizona supreme court opinion forcefully renewed federal protection reservation indian governments this court referred treaty navajo people federal government terms “implicit treaty terms understanding internal affairs indians remain exclusively within jurisdiction whatever tribal government existed” now court went acknowledge decisions court applied state laws indian reservations affairs nonindians recited cases done and extent old case worcester georgia modified however sentence court said “the basic policy worcester remained” in words policy affairs indians reservation exclusively federal tribal authority this court also emphasized meticulous control congress exercised years reservation indian affairs the court stated congress acted consistently upon assumption states power regulate indian affairs reservations congress wished states exercise power granted jurisdiction worcester georgia denied states now phase unbroken string decisions arizona court essentially tried avoid affect decision two grounds first court dealt court’s decision williams lee distinguishing  creating distinction i would say affairs navajo tribe affairs individual navajo indians the court seems say state invasion cripple tribal government okay however court many occasions ruled affairs individual indians reservations subject jurisdiction tribe states in kansas indians 19th century case court expressly ruled state kansas could tax individual indians  state  state the affairs tribe involved that property tax your honor yes in much recent case i think personal real property case in much recent case kennerly district court montana montana district court excuse montana supreme court made sort ruling it said personal debt individual indian tribal affair this court overruled decision court’s opinion kennerly district court montana and course williams lee really involved personal affairs indiana the tribe wasn’t party case all tribe provided court navajo contended manner heard now  language court’s opinion williams lee arizona relies briefs refer infringement test in reads question always whether state action infringed right reservation indians make laws ruled we suggest arizona badly distorted meaning phrase of course phrase begins question always it new rule in words court referring time honored rule reservation indians entitled govern affairs furthermore court state makes laws ruled we suggest means laws indians make rule rather state laws now  yes your honor there shortly your honor there i believe one  one occasion i know they may yes sir that convinced us that’s  that’s correct they participate state government certain amount interaction reservation affairs state affairs authorized congress our contention it’s congress adjust relationship it’s arizona whenever congress wanted adjust relationship done detail congress specifically said states  levy certain taxes reservation indians tax that’s issue and suggest that congress i think appealed question adjustment relationship now  yes your honor they didn’t vote weren’t considered citizens that’s  that’s correct the indian citizenship granted act congress 1924 since time court repeatedly rule question federal protection indians repeatedly rejected contention citizenship ends protection it congress end specifically hasn’t done implicitly act like citizenship act the   subsequent decision court organized village kake egan sentence paraphrase decisions court earlier decisions court including williams lee and sentence also seized upon arizona court state courts effort infer somehow door open state application laws indian reservations we suggest that sentence taken context misread the kake case involved indians reservation comprehensive tribal government rule distinct territory therefore quite different navajos and i think  what extent claim making claim arizona’s opt tax reservation indian income earned outside reservation if indian income earned reservation your honor i think question would one sometimes turn taxing  termed taxing jurisdiction due process issue well would  would  would position i think would depend particular facts taxing jurisdiction decisions go question benefit burden theory taxation much services received sort thing i think  you wouldn’t making argument you’re making no sir i would you wouldn’t think argument would valid case i think  i think indians based argument i’m making would entitled kind considerations prevailed  cases courts considered taxing jurisdiction nine residents essentially that kind situation i think kinds issues would govern that situation and would  would  would argument cover member tribal leave reservation no your honor if tribal member leaves reservation subject state jurisdiction i think settled long we’re we’re suggesting otherwise even though  even though earns income reservation well – that turns around taxing jurisdiction question that makes tribe justify taxing jurisdiction i think occurred but  cases involved interaction two taxing jurisdictions way  know city’s taxing commuters kind question taxing jurisdiction there discussion issue one amicus briefs i don’t think it’s relevant main question and well vote  state furnish various services tribe education  the state furnishes minor amount services tribe your honor i lived window rock reservation schools record your honor  relevant issue pointed matter remanded record either side but i lived window rock school budget school district i live 20 state supported well voting thing isn’t part record either is isn’t well matter decision law arizona there decision arizona courts reservation indians vote state  cited briefs but i’d say may 10 support education reservation comes state sources overall perhaps 10 source welfare money that’s there aren’t many state services significance reservation furthermore reservations schools educating nonindians i mean i could children reservation schools i pay state taxes this issue doesn’t concern there real property tax levy your honor that’s local there real property interests reservation taxable indian mineral production taxable state system apache county administered source money reservation there isn’t money comes reservations supporting reservations schools apache county yes your honor if mean sense apache county derives money reservation resources reapplies reservation yes that’s correct i think importance difference case court’s decision organized village kake egan shown fact later court ruled warren trading post company arizona tax commission navajos entitled selfgovernment there issues case court distinctly renewed commitment protection navajos government course supreme court minnesota ruled contrary arizona courts decision think correct i think  important point consider implications state’s position indians first state’s position acknowledged williams lee right it’s decision court once it’s going  haven’t contended far overruled now means sometimes don’t jurisdiction apply laws reservation now say sometimes constitutional question time decide obviously productive litigation i mean case taken appellate decision well that’s serious problem consider situation uncertainty that’s created reservation indian merely sitting receives letter state bureau phoenix tells must something state law requires and decide whether state law constitutional principles suggest apply  conflicts tribal law way well uncertainty seems to warranted i don’t think court intended create kind uncertainty decided williams lee that’s contend williams lee misread we suggests  thank your honor military jurisdiction always based status accused rather nature offense mr chief justice may please court at time adjourned i pointing implications arizona’s position create great uncertainty reservation indians each indian must decide peril whether particular situation  particular situation applied whether state law that’s applied conflicts tribal authority and third implication state’s position word state views law the state pick choose come reservation we see trying tax it’s advantage congress offered states public law 280 opportunity assume broad range jurisdiction sort in return states assume certain burden burdens manning courts police born indians federal government it’s clear congress’ intent  burden services born state arizona attempting avoidance  intent congress justice rehnquist  question i’m fully aware central question case follow one i’m certain full reaches public law 280 since going fully argued competent counsel case i prefer comment but seems clear absence compliance public law 280 it’s absolutely inaudible jurisdiction tax the full reach act important question  i think  i think congress congress virtue protection indians provides substantial services quite large services detailed court’s opinion warren trading post company arizona tax commission but congress suggested certain cases public law 280 one example termination laws 1950 another federal protection withdrawn leaves indians ordinary citizens state federal protection federal services means states provide normal services providing in sense congress impose duty states yes your honor i think  i think economic relationship tribes states controlled congress i think hand congress made indian citizens states entitled right citizens this gotten detail reply brief i refer complete answer position might question the federal government provides broad services withdrawn equities might grossly altered everything stands states provide good services navajos the state limited taxing authority navajos the economic thing pretty balance i think state trying upset i think radical change coming come federal government it’s federal government providing services keep economic situation balance and it’s congress change it’s congress order arrangement but i answer question yes i think citizen states entitled rights citizens i think preemption would proper word your honor yes i think thrust  no your honor i think it’s constitution i think worcester georgia rules constitution indians affairs preempted federal government now courts subsequently ruled  no sir congress  i agree congress power see jurisdiction states repeatedly detailed i think mr sachse united states going elaborate particular laws relevant  i believe your honor – court’s opinions referred several constitutional provisions the indian commerce clause treaty power supremacy clause combined leading rule worcester georgia state inheritance taxes yes i would nonreservation indians indians receiving full services state involved cases that’s  that’s difference world they’re reservation they’re entitled protection federal treaty forth a i think small reservations your honor i think it’s open contention court’s decisions depended tribal government existence i’m sure would apply it happens fact small reservations public law 280 governed law specifically arizona never complied public law 280 states ones states large reservation tribal departments enlarge so i’m sure question exist reality  yes your honor definitely i mean navajo tribe quite interested case file brief support jurisdiction  it might i would suppose might i’m sticking  that’s question i can’t answer definitely in conclusion  want urge we’re asking change law we’re asking court reaffirmed it’s historic commitment selfgovernment indian reservations court uncertainty created arizona done couple states trying interpret decisions court allowing invasion indian jurisdiction we’re talking contend settled area jurisprudence the prior decisions court acts congress make clear arizona court wrong reverse court thank you,220.0,272,24,mr collins well kind tax kansas trying levy mr collins property tax are opinion votes arizona elections are  reservation indians arizona state legislature there past ever and going  want new legislation next month so selfgovernment they also participate government state arizona exercising elective franchise back days worcester georgia vote reasonable assumption and part mr justice stewart suggested governmental thing  overall government and get support schools apache county navajo county addition state but apache county whatever source may contribute something financing schools reservation we resume point 1 o’clock mr collins may continue if arizona accepted congressional offer would authorized tax think mr collins if congress power impose duties states area now  what’s scope power power i get inaudible congress fine states furnish services time without tax mr collins i believe one state’s contentions accept proposition indians least purpose discrete group subject state taxing power indians seeking benefit equal protection clause assert state treated discriminatory manner logically state could say well know less choice they different treat differently do response your theory basically one  preemption i suppose sense isn’t federal instrumentality theory anything like they occupied field thrust law state shouldn’t burden it’s statutory it’s purely result federal statutory law well yes  it’s beyond power congress – well couldn’t beyond power congress submit state law well it’s also constitutional sense supremacy would like argument respect inheritance taxes and distinguished oklahoma case grounds nonreservation indians involved but  indians reservation don’t time government would make argument well i’m trying find whether theory nothing  withdrawing resources tribal government well tribal government question might different thank mr collins mr sachse,1306.0,1439,5,mr chief justice may please court the issue case whether state arizona impose income tax income navajo indian earned navajo indian reservation particular indian residing reservation now number cases involving question federal income tax liability indians residing reservations and cases decided favor tax liability in oklahoma tax commission case although inheritance tax case nevertheless government decision referred income tax cases state federal income tax liability equated after  leahy decision involving oklahoma income tax this case decided 1930s and many ways similar situation today although opinion short the briefs throw conservatively light subject the state indians reservation they treaty federal government they tribal government as matter fact united states congress passed law providing state probate jurisdiction regard osage case decided indication viable tribal government now particular case court upheld state taxation it appeared court opinion since indians received income free dispose wished reason shouldn’t taxed i beg pardon mr justice in leahy case income came restricted mineral property this property owned tribe osage tribe no that something i clear i wasn’t able find anything record indicated whether reservation there state court cases four raised rather five six i counting case question raised one brun case minnesota decided favor tax liability the gahate case new mexico one probably like it involved navajo indian the difference gahate case i see gahate case counsel navajo stipulated imposition income tax state new mexico infringe upon sovereignty navajo tribe the counsel unwilling stipulate case now brun case court apply williams versus lee test absentee  test validity state action indian reservation whether infringes rights granted act congress upon indian right selfgovernment the court brun case concluded imposition minnesota tax infringed right selfgovernment there  simply assumed apparently economic impact tax in words indians pay tax state minnesota would less able pay tax i supposed tribe levy tax at rate decision certainly respect conflict decisions cases like graves versus new york helvering versus gerhardt involved questions whether state employees pay federal income taxes whether federal employees pay state income taxes in cases court concluded fact employee state government federal government pay income taxes government impose sort substantial burden government so test  practical test substantial interference essential governmental function the court brun case obviously apply test now one factors involved connection tax imposed state arizona since 1957 least attorney general opinion state arizona rendered subject tax really infringed upon selfgovernment navajo tribe it would seem heard now  yes your honor if tax paid well state would attempt collect now question whether state could levy navajo reservation i think state probably would attempt because  on navajo reservation i don’t know your honor i inclined think state could but i don’t know under enabling act cannot tax real property reservation it specifically excluded your honor property taxation on indians residing indian reservation well thing i think came outside scope warren trading post case in words indians involved indian traders selling items indian reservation well i would think would subject sales tax according figures  would 2 million 3 million state collected according governor’s study completed state yes your honor the income tax that’s reservations state navajo reservation course indian population state although state may 125000 indians 80000 90000 live navajo reservation now it’s position williams versus lee cited counsel appellee distinguished case involved infringement right selfgovernment navajo tribe that case involved jurisdiction courts court concluded state courts jurisdiction essentially trouble matters matter relating liability navajo resident reservation connection transaction entered reservation reasons additional reasons procedural point involved think kennerly case also distinguishable now various arguments raised appellants expressed congressional authorization required order state laws apply reservation this extremely narrow question i think united states already conceded regards khan case state laws may indian reservations third persons now i think state laws practical matter apply indian reservations when you’re talking certain benefits even benefits conferred federal statutes contract johnsono’malley act i talking things right vote when navajo indian votes navajo reservation state election vote tribal law federal law he voting state law now case kake versus egan set considered rule state laws apply indian reservations two exceptions if infringe upon tribal government tribe infringe upon rights granted act congress this certainly line court held surplus trading company versus cook i believe indicated effect state laws restricted application indian reservations meaning application i think restricted application court referring exceptions indian right selfgovernment and laws cannot apply conflict federal laws and new york versus martin court said absence treaty obligations federal statute’s state laws apply indian reservations now position act congress prohibits application state income taxes indians the first statute comes mind connection chronological order state enabling act state arizona and considerable confusion language i would like read language subject dispute connection “that people inhabiting said proposed state agree declare forever disclaim right entitled unappropriated ungranted public lands lying within boundaries thereof lands lying within said boundaries owned held indian indian tribes the right title shall acquired united states prior sovereignty title indian indian tribes shall extinguished shall remain subject disposition absolute jurisdiction control congress united states” these referred disclaimer absolute jurisdiction control provisions now refer indian reservations although subsequently enabling act congress refer indian reservations but refer indian lands reason distinction pointed draper case general allotment act 1887 congress provided indians living reservations could obtain unappropriated public lands would subject restrictions lands obtained allotments it desire congress time arizona admitted union protect rights indians lands and enabling act like many states and done language used indian lands referred reason there ambiguity i think confirmed number state court decisions subject well recent decision court kake versus egan now  public law 280 enacted 1953 at time policy federal government get indian reservations termination policy one  concern time provisions 280 provided state assumption jurisdiction now also confusion time state enabling acts meant this confusion indicated letter quoted committee reports it’s brief congress acted partly clear confusion they wanted provide procedure states would consider enabling acts stumbling block so would assume measure jurisdiction federal government could relieved responsibility soon indians ready public law 280 deprive states jurisdiction already now civil rights act 1968 amended public law 280 effect require tribal consent state assumption jurisdiction there one item treaty 1868 and treaty nothing tax liability indians it 1871 government decided indians internal problem would treaties indians would seem fair distinguish navajos indians navajos treaty says nothing taxes immunity taxation implied if congress intended accept 100000 navajos arizona income taxes would certainly said clear unmistakable language now navajos unusual indian reservation there 16 18 indian reservations state arizona navajos represented they extremely large reservation they resources average reservation certainly require less assistance reservations reservations small hardly economical unit economical governmental unit some may hundred acres hundred indians can’t provide can’t receive services federal government state would provide obviously able furnish services but even navajo indians require many services state it’s  i don’t regard important counsel side mentioned i reluctant mention it’s outside record but nevertheless according information governor’s report financial picture presented relationship indian tribe accurate the state substantial state sense state spends lot money indian reservations gets back total runs millions dollars now income tax net income fair tax the rate structure arizona state income tax low one it runs 15 8 it extremely fair way balance burdens state government that true your honor i mentioning mentioned ever since warren trading post case felt state make provision indians reservation course state’s rule greatly grown i agree i arguments your honor unless court questions thank excuse honor i though i minute i’m  i two three sentences your honor may please court in reply mr justice white’s question constitution definitely think it’s constitutional allocation power establishment reservation federal government formal involvement necessary i think mr sachse said the leahy case oklahoma cases oklahoma law like public law 280 and time leahy case committing jurisdiction states it wasn’t public law 280 it may scope certainly doesn’t apply navajos and finally  it mineral share allotment i believe your honor well your honor it’s what’s called osage mineral shares ruled personal property individual indian i agree formally shares tribe’s mineral income shares inheritable one indian another and finally one sentence excuse am i right remembering lee case somewhere course opinion i think footnote the distinctively different oklahoma situation mentioned yes your honor that’s correct and distinctively different situation least find specific statute predecessor generalized 280 that  that’s point your honor oklahoma situation application it’s subject special laws don’t apply arizona  i agree your honor i one sentence court  contended order granted decision court construed public law 280 ruling case kennerly case i don’t time go it’s briefs thank you,107.0,145,16,where earn income where indians earn income leahy case on reservation what happen   tax isn’t paid do mean say state could do think state could levy property that real property yes sir is state tax real property what tax put yes sir well many indians living reservation paid sales tax i mean paid income tax on income tax counsel good arguments economic theory taxed don’t reach statutory basis constitutional basis that might  very well thank much i think time something important  well friend used we’ll give back anyway something mind the tax individual share tribal income voice overlap individual share income property owned tribe exactly i would assume former chief justice court criminal appeals oklahoma paid income tax choctaw indian also chief judge so i assume paid state income tax i don’t see what’s ending case thank gentlemen the case submitted,862.0,1110,5,mr chief justice may please court the united states agrees mr collins’ position case i want try clarify position see emphasize amount congressional activity area law impropriety allowing state unilaterally obtain jurisdiction within indian reservation congress authorize state obtain jurisdiction in view it’s law many years absence congressional authorization  situations consent tribe state laws including state tax laws limited state tax laws including state tax laws applicability indians within indian reservation this literally hornbook law point brief quotation mr felix cohen’s hornbook it also  view real holding williams versus lee what’s happened court kake case nothing tribal  reservation indians make one sentence paraphrase williams versus lee and arizona court seized one sentence paraphrase try make lee one amicus put turn head make lee decision allows states act without congressional authority within indian reservation whereas fact lee decision exactly opposite the language i think clear statement lee opinion whole case course the opinion justice black page 220 358 us justice black said “congress acted consistently upon assumption states power regulate affairs indians reservation” and justice black cites four five statutes based assumption concludes significantly congress wished states exercise power it expressly granted jurisdiction worcester versus georgia denied i think that’s sound basis decision case adopt view supreme court arizona would opening worms laws apply indians within indian reservations now i want use time i bring court’s attention number individual statutes congress chosen whether state law apply within indian reservations emphasize particularity congress acted respect i’ll start tax laws pictures equally clear general laws mr sachse take position based primarily statutes rather constitution our position constitution gave congress full authority affairs indians congress exercised authority congress government treaties setting executive order reservations congress exercise authority terms enabling acts western states exercise authority time time providing small bits jurisdiction states within indian reservations there’s room  sir i don’t know i don’t think certainly issue presented  case i think first law one would look would enabling acts states see extent states claim jurisdiction now congress indians don’t live reservations held that tried federal courts 18 usc defining indian country doesn’t  does position make room state tax nonreservation indian yes income tax inheritance tax our  position think it’s correct reservation indians you start assumption state laws authority indians least matters income they’ve earned reservation as nonreservation indians start proposition tax like anyone else if show particular statute gives tax exemption tax exemption for instance – many  many nonreservation indians live allotments and squire versus capoeman court held allotment creates tax exemption and would go i supposed reservation indians earning income reservation going reservation work state tax income i would think i don’t know i don’t want state government position issue certainly income earned reservation quite difference case case no except fortiori sense federal government traditionally greater taxing powers indians states jurisdictional problem federal government there’s jurisdictional problem state taxing indians least within indian reservation yes sir i mean legislative jurisdiction i mean application state laws indians within indian reservation that i mean jurisdiction the jurisdictional problem could arise  situation withholding tax state trying collect tax someone paid he would question state collecting  trying collect tax  it’s location plus indian plus tribal government plus tribal government nonindians reservation don’t problem well nonindians reservation situation know presented kahn petition court now court acted kahn versus arizona tax commission in view much difficult case if worcester versus georgia stood original strength kahn couldn’t taxed either and reservation absolute federal enclave state authority anyone including nonindians couldn’t taxed either but admit worcester weakened point allowing state jurisdiction applies solely nonindians within indian reservation so  i don’t know i would i judge deciding case  unless specific federal statute  unless specific federal statute authorized i think time i left much i’d best mention special statutes for instance 1929 i believe congress decided would good idea allow state motor vehicle fuel taxes apply sales motor vehicle fuel whether sort federal reservation whether sold even licensed trader specifically authorized tax and date without decisions court kind serious problem states able collect motor vehicle tax congressional authority within indian reservations in 1949 congress time military bases built around country 1940 actually i believe when congress considered whether wanted allow state income taxes state sales taxes apply within federal areas debate act called buck act debate act clear congressmen proposed apply within indian reservations the department interior objected wanted indian reservations totally excluded act and conclusion congress arrived put 4 usc 109 says though states may assess income tax within federal areas shall apply indians otherwise taxed standard phrase indians living reservation indian country now say – we’re trying undo footnote warren trading post case it said buck act apply indian reservations but doesn’t apply indian reservations conscious choice congress authorize imposition state income taxes indians within indian reservations similarly congress authorized taxation mineral interests within indian reservations it particularity authorized taxation mineral interests unallotted triballyheld lands provided state taxes could create lien land and away area taxation i don’t think i need discuss public law 280 course basic statute congress authorized states exercise broad jurisdiction also broad limits within indian reservations but i want point one particular statute limited statute cited kake case that’s 25 usc 231 congress 1930s decided would good idea let state health authorities enter indian reservations allow state truancy officers enter indian reservations obviously considered took congressional act congress acted it particular way it authorized secretary interior allow federal officers enter it didn’t direct it authorized discretion it directed write rules regulations determine extent state officers could come truancy part it specifically provided could done consent tribal government tribal government area question now submit way states obtain jurisdiction within indian reservations obtain it congressional act though it’s to say particularly i think congressional act also require consent indian tribe reservations created whether treaty executive order certainly  assumption states would jurisdiction within reservations worcester versus georgia ruling law i don’t think rests entirely i able  well saying absent specific federal statute granting power tax constitution requires state stay reservation i would agree except word “the constitution” well that’s big big exempt well i think constitution combined treaties made indians enabling acts states requires states stay indian reservations without congressional approval but that’s  i trouble envisaging constitution without thinking fact situation would apply namely existence indian reservation and constitution order federal government create indian reservations federal government there federal statutes question constitution could state tax i would rather would say i would say indian reservation existed would exist executive order statute treaty if existed ways state could tax within indian reservation without consent federal government,65.0,85,3,you say congress  constitution given congress general authority affairs indian would say congress could prohibit state taxing criminally dealing nonreservation indian chose in squire versus capoeman federal – federal income tax wasn’t i mean would necessarily carryover state income tax when say jurisdiction would precise mean – i take it withholding indians employer voluntary so state asserting process reservation do mean legislative jurisdiction i wondering whether position rest fact specific federal statutes infer congressional intent exclude states reservation case to exclude  mr

76,1988.88-389,Ohio Pub. Employees Retirement System v. Betts,88-389,607068000.0,614581200.0,Ohio Pub. Employees Retirement System,Betts,7.0,2.0,1,1369.0,2018,11,thank mr chief justice may please court this case presents following issue must agebased distinctions benefits offered bona fide employee benefit plan justified agerelated cost considerations the sixth circuit answered question affirmative the public employees retirement system ohio however disputes holding believes agerelated cost justification inconsistent plain language age discrimination employment act moreover inconsistent purposes adea particular section 4f2 act the facts follows the public employees retirement system ohio i refer pers created ohio general assembly 1933 it provides retirement benefits ohio public employee municipal county state level there two types retirement benefits available age service retirements benefits disability retirement benefits there three ways qualify age service retirement benefits a member pers may must least five years service credit attained age 60 must least 25 years service credit least 55 years age must 30 years service credit irrespective age in order qualify disability retirement benefits member pers must least five years service credit attained age 60 presume permanently disabled june betts im sorry the actuarial assumptions underlie disability retirement benefits age service retirement benefits intertwined and benefits whether age service disability retirement benefits derived common fund june betts appellee hired hamilton county board mental retardation developmental disabilities age 55 at age 61 became disabled health she submitted applications disability retirement benefits age service retirement benefits pers she requested age service retirement application processed unless disability retirement application could processed june betts interested disability retirement benefits would afforded higher monthly pension because ohio law contains age 6o cutoff eligibility apply disability retirement benefits pers could process disability retirement application they however process approve age service application she currently receiving monthly pension well full health care june betts initiated suit claiming age 60 cutoff ohio law eligibility apply disability retirement benefits constituted violation age discrimination employment act pers defended basis plan protected section 4f2 act provides illegal employer observe terms bona fide employee benefit plan retirement pension insurance plan subterfuge evade purposes act provided plan permits requires involuntary retirement age the district court granted june betts motion summary judgment two bases first court held pers type plan contemplated 4f2 age 60 cutoff could justified agerelated cost considerations secondly district court found unavailability disability retirement benefits june betts equivalent constructive discharge involuntary retirement age a divided panel sixth circuit affirmed basis age 60 cutoff pers could justified agerelated cost consideration it however reach constructive discharge involuntary retirement question now pers asserts sixth circuit incorrect holding 4f2 requires showing agerelated cost three reasons mr chief justice relying language says quite clearly bona fide employee benefit plan retirement pension insurance plan subterfuge evade purposes act the language clearly contain agerelated cost justification in respect involuntary retirement your honor subterfuge language your honor sixth circuit reach question involuntary retirement however the the concept notion june betts ineligible apply particular benefit involuntarily retired age applicable it health required june betts fact motivated june betts apply retire she wanted retire the question kind retirement benefit going receive which subterfuge evade purposes act yes your honor the sixth circuit address question the two reasons besides fact yes justice oconnor in 1976 ohio general assembly instituted minimum benefit disability retirement benefits 30 percent minimum well 30 percent increase what ohio general assembly instituted provision disability retirant would receive less 30 percent final average salary that correct it postact action however your honor distinguished disability age disability retirants age service retirants it distinguish specifically basis age the ohio general assembly made decision increase benefits would available minimum benefit disability retirants but wasnt basis age it affects disability retirants age service retirants irrespective age so pers contention that particular amendment ohio law remove preexisting plan status your honor the sort impact provision would respect age is it could residual impact noted prior 1976 benefit calculated but provision neutral face intended enhance benefits disability retirants now court approaching the position sort disparate impact assume adea disparate impact cause action i aware dispute respect point would still june betts would obligated introduce evidence statistical data demonstrate disparate impact older workers 30 percent minimum in event provision ageneutral discriminate older workers and therefore whether pers preact plan plan your honor particular provision therefore that correct but suggesting whole plan ageneutral first pers would assert preexisting plan provisions discriminate basis age ie age 60 cutoff plan well adea passed let alone made applicable states moreover no your honor your honor perss assertion 4f2 one must look see whether plan whole serves subterfuge evade purposes act the question pers plan whole serve frustrate employment older workers discriminate respect wages terms compensation incidentals arent associated employee benefit plans pers suggesting order determine whether plan subterfuge one must look plan whole operates and pers plan operates whole retirement plan it created offer retirement benefits various individuals applicants could longer work chose longer work state ohio might retirement benefit available but plan established created purpose arriving older workers work force interfering hiring the fact june betts hired age 55 would permitted would entitled remain job irrespective age except health indicates plan effect driving person job market yes your honor fact age 60 cutoff made facially discriminatory and never assertion pers isnt discrimination permitting people age 60 older apply pers defense 4f2 exemption sort discrimination permissible long terms plan observed long purpose plan provide employee benefit employee benefits long plan isnt designed frustrate employment older workers discriminate respect compensation would receive outside employee benefit plan pers bona fide i mean pers retirement system purpose behind it exists i mean pays substantial benefits that correct your honor the agerelated cost consideration creates obstacle employers no your honor yes one interesting things agerelated cost justification courts cant seem agree portion exemption provides statutory justification and one might suggest type plan argument development circumvent courts holding mcmann v united airlines united airlines v mcmann subterfuge no your honor dont they dont point language the appellee amicus solicitor generals office would argue i use terms say language subterfuge language read accommodate agerelated cost justification but clear statute says bona fide employee benefit plan retirement pension insurance plan they congress opportunity include agerelated cost justification could said what trying get much direct fashion first your honor i would point court thats argument posed question is reasonable light language statute there nothing face statute qualifies protection coverage exemption plan demonstrate differences benefits offered older younger workers result agerelated cost i think your honor evidence court would scrutinize whether plan whole intended evade purposes act so one look intent one problems agerelated cost justification takes test requires inquiry motivation employer requires employer satisfy objective rule if cant demonstrate agerelated cost justification ipso facto subterfuge matter intent employer and agerelated cost justification present language the court language congress i think court would require employer demonstrate plan conceived intention frustrating employment older workers for instance plan made difficult employer older worker hired made difficult older worker advance within employ particular company specifically persons age or tried use plan reduce wages salaries older workers that would mean subterfuge evade purposes act i think good example might karlen case seventh circuit now court find age old rely agerelated cost justification found plan bona fide found plan may conceived purpose forcing older workers job market thats sort inquiry court would engage and cost justification i think court least rejected respect to preexisting plans mcmann decision i think justice whites concurrence specifically rejects economic business purpose necessary agerelated cost certainly type economic business purpose would improper test and thats your honor congress overrule part mcmann decision it reversed court respect holding involuntary retirement based age legal within 4f2 exemption but language passed congress says specifically it addresses exclusively issue involuntary retirement there nothing language 78 amendment suggest congress addressing anything mcmann position involuntary retirement now appellee may point language legislative history first legislative history i think much confirm congress concerned issue involuntary retirement admonishing courts whether involuntary retirement provision came passage adea made difference going complete restriction respect involuntary retirement basis age but the amendment 1978 dealt issue involuntary retirement remarks legislative history involving 67 amendment meant 67 act meant irrelevant you cant look older congress court looked congress 10 years later define meaning legislation passed 1967 moreover in appellees brief amicus brief contend 1967 act one purpose in effect saying least two purposes underlying 4f2 exemption well remarks 78 legislative history refer say mention agerelated costs it seems inherent position people congress 78 even misconstruing scope 4f2 exemption now i think court aware two portions courts try plug agerelated cost consideration language subterfuge language now i discussed length shouldnt fit subterfuge language i would like address cant fit retirement pension insurance plan language the basic reason agerelated cost common thread binds pension retirement insurance plans in 1967 adea promulgated even today plans pers plans defined contribution pension plans profit sharing pension plan cannot reflect agerelated costs and congress passed legislation common types retirement plans they could limited scope exemption wanted picked broad language they said bona fide employee benefit plan retirement pension insurance plan but emphasize point employers could discriminate respect salary wages incidentals associated coming work putting days work days pay so common thread retirement pension insurance plans however fact provide compensation kind outside wages salary moreover common sorts aspects benefits within particular plan instance defined benefit plan agerelated cost justification set social security increase employer provide benefits social security also providing benefits but sort provision would illegal cant justified agerelated cost consideration now i think i touched length fact language doesnt support legislative history i id like point reinforce time congress passed legislation even today fairly common understanding employee benefit plan in fact remarkable legislation throughout years reflected similarity industry congress recognizes employee benefit plan and sorts plans like pers stranger congress time passed legislation and id also like point justice whites concurrence united airlines v mcmann justice white enunciated policy enunciating i think also consistent it got one vote i thought good vote laughter i think also mcmann majority inherently reflected position said explicitly preexisting plan didnt show agerelated cost justification didnt show business economic purpose and court concludes whether one wants consider dicta majority bench still concluded opinion saying without qualification economic business purpose necessary demonstrate employer falls within perimeters section 4f2 exemption now much appellees case rests court taking legislative history trying cram someplace 4f2 exemption and they contend clear 1967 legislative history congress talking agerelated costs well one principal pieces legislative history regard adea secretary labors report court noted eeoc v wyoming provided great deal guidance congress and secretary labor provided cost justification in fact secretary labor noted that wasnt principal hindrance what legislative history demonstrates 4f2 vital compromise it represented vital piece package order get age discrimination employment act passed congress wanted insure older workers would hired they wanted promote that consuming purpose adea and consuming purpose 4f2 exemption protect employee benefit plans might serve hindrances hiring older workers protect disruption and age discrimination agerelated cost justification certainly disrupt bona fide plans i would direct court towards amicus brief submitted state pennsylvania pages 29 30 pennsylvania notes least 10 states denied disability retirement benefits people eligible age service retirement and make reference 25 states plans sort distinction based age respect disability retirement benefits i would also direct court amicus brief submitted association private pension welfare plans direct court page 24 indicate majority retirement plans like plan issue apparently limit eligibility disability benefits younger employees ineligible regular early retirement benefits so congress trying avoid disruption employee benefit plans order insure employers would hire older workers agerelated cost considerations injustice the last point i would like make moving legislative history amicus eeoc person solicitor generals office argue court adopt agerelated cost considerations consideration reflective consistent agency policy well i agency interpretation i would like make note court legislation first eeoc department labor regulations first published 1969 initially one safe harbor then later 69 created two safe harbors when eeoc republished revamped regulations involving section 4f2 went back one purpose one way satisfy exemption and appeal first time litigation argue really two purposes well i dont see sort flipflop consistent agency interpretation if anything indicates agency inconsistent and unless court questions i would like reserve time rebuttal,192.0,241,24,well hear argument next no 88389 public employees retirement system ohio v june betts mr sutter may proceed whenever youre ready what precise language 4f2 relying mr sutter but proviso comes afterwards well says employee benefit plan shall require permit involved et cetera et cetera does bearing so say us whether pers bona fide employee benefit plan retirement pension insurance plan which subterfuge evade purposes mr sutter may i ask operation plan i take benefits voluntary retirement disability 1976 well and 1976 30 percent increase disability benefits right well discrepancy arose action 76 and postact action well seems could viewed attempt use preact plan a subterfuge right well the plan viewed whole ageneutral you saying the addition 1976 but look if look whole plan amended difficult see ageneutral well cant make subsequent changes impunity do look subsequent changes effect see subterfuge but look effect amended appears facially discriminatory well all retirement plans are discriminatory on basis age arent well didnt court appeals didnt say subterfuge they they went went cost differences what what what guidelines called guidelines rely in requiring cost justification do identify language act theyre construing well may but isnt argument subterfuge isnt age cost justification isnt isnt least argument isnt well evidence cost justification would ever relevant determining proving facially discriminatory plan subterfuge well would employer intend point cost justifications isnt indication congress intended overrule part mcmann decision how many votes get very well mr sutter mr laufman,1027.0,1466,25,thank mr chief justice may i please court when june betts disabled age 61 denied disability benefits pers solely age and forced retire apply regular retirement rather disability retirement but pers age 60 rule person pers plan june betts would received 355 disability benefits instead 15850 per month received now undisputed pers plan discriminates basis age would violation act unless eligible 4f2 exemption act pers two arguments the first arguments pre1967 plans exempt perpetuity the second issues requirement employee benefit plans discriminate basis age must justified cost considerations i focus primarily first issue mr wright behalf united states focusing addressing second issue turning first issue as noted pread act plan 1976 modifications the lower courts unanimous holding substantial relevant modifications employee benefit plan loses status preact plan your honor court appeals address issue ruled congress overturned mcmann therefore unnecessary reach particular this is correct we also argued called mcmann issue longer viable it plan start take age 6o putting 30 percent floor disability denies employees become disabled age 60 discriminates employees disabled age 60 employees disabled age 60 that correct that correct with amount seniority employee disabled age 59 would receive 30 percent an employee disable age 25 would receive 75 percent life and totally different many plans people familiar yes go ahead i think i understand question basically right if look 1976 would received approximately income either plan that correct because way regular retirement is calculated 30 percent floor affects employees five years less 15 years 13 17 years small group become disabled age 60 so dealing very small group people and total dollar effect require taking away age 60 requirement would would like dropping pebble pond its position changes 1967 caused pers lose preact exemption might now dont agree thing preact exemption anymore we believe thats limited involuntary retirement systems believe clearly longer law following 1967 1978 according that absolutely correct that correct also i think going youre talking amendments plans amendment statute that correct and lower courts unanimous holding make substantial relevant changes and i suggest submit test substantial relevant going kind a test courts used applying time if change thing allowing police officers buy one one year extra time buy service credit probably would significant relevant but start changing things directly affect impact age discrimination factor i submit significant relevant factor clearly case the approach pers takes preexisting plans exempt effect saying congress granted perpetual exemption perpetual right continue violate law somehow congress says wrong changes law what theyve done created two classes you pre1967 post1967 the preact free discriminate that correct youd still show subterfuge youd cost benefit basis and i think and i submit thats theres theres basis its important note i think 4f2 exception remedial statute and position interpreted narrowly now burden and first court said thats affirmative defense and burden pers show qualifies now burden proving subterfuge now theres two different ways approaching cost justification thats correct thats one the employers burden proving something subterfuge difficult task proving negative especially state legislature ohio keeps legislative history so almost impossible determine intent amended passed act well is that precisely the eeoc regulations provide they guidelines theyre theyre call interpretations we submit court give deference consistent years theyve effect 20 years whole employers country adhering regulations the regulations changed totally consistent in 1969 regulations came amounted equal cost equal benefits approach that plan paid equal benefits discrimination on hand plan cost amount even thought provided smaller benefits discrimination and example given eeoc regs perfectly right employer pay 100 life insurance employees and turns younger employee gets twice much life insurance might violation act permitted 4f2 exemption thats true and thats true but but point i think important note pers produced absolutely evidence kind justification their entire approach existed therefore existence dont anything they produced absolutely evidence kind justification so types one come forward another type the justice eeoc regulations effect years consistent provide objective way meeting complex problem there multitude employee benefit plans even within retirement plans profitsharing plans defined benefit plans variations well i dont think really get intent the intent discriminate already established the question whether subterfuge could produce costbased justification dispelled argument subterfuge thats correct i believe court said thurston section 4f1 4f2 affirmative defenses burden would always defendant well i think in position regulation position employers theyre one the evidence cost considerations theyre ones i said cost defense made effort put evidence suggest cost justification im sorry oh i think i referring impact plan pers plan court ruled plan violation act employees fit narrow window effect 50 100 employees would added plan pays something like 400 million year benefits would insignificant that point i making the court essentially quoted judge posner karlen said employer cannot produce actuarial costs justify age discrimination employee benefits hed better able prove close correlation age cost wants shelter safe harbor section 4f2 that i believe is position court taken yes i would like point pers says essentially employee benefit plans covered essentially throwing eeoc regulations effect 20 years and particular regulation effect 1o years pertaining disability plans pers clearly violates the plan disability section regs says employees disabled younger age entitled longterm disability benefits cost justification denying benefits altogether employees disabled older ages essentially pers would read section 4f2 statute if employee benefit plans exempt maintain supplemental unemployment benefits severance pay prepaid legal services would exempt none agebased cost justification now court today davis v michigan said statutory language cannot examined vacuum words statute must read context view place overall statutory scheme congress passed section 4a1 says shall unlawful discriminate terms conditions employment and set exception hand says shall lawful discriminate certain types employee benefit plans the eeoc regulations careful harmonizing two conflicting parts statute it provides recognizes congress passed law 1967 recognized certain problems certain types employee benefit plans expensive older workers younger workers and intended employers would allowed reduce benefits extent cost and this regulation balances justice scalla i admit poorly drafted statute i think we statute it want i think i think time recognized problem absolutely nothing legislative history indicates considered resolve problem instead said expect secretary labor write comprehensive regulations they said 1967 they said statute said 1979 and exactly happened the department labor later eeoc expertise handling comprehensive employee benefit plans wrote regulations clearly provide balancing discriminating employee unnecessarily depriving penalizing employer hires older workers i believe harmonizing two statutes purposes act along purpose exemption i dont answer and troubled courts first time its poorly written statute agree i believe mcmann limited involuntary retirement clear costbased justification intent congress talking permitting involuntary retirement eeoc regulations adea ill try department labor regulations none anything cost justification involuntary retirement the regulations employee benefits back 1969 i believe time thank thank mr chief justice two points right bat i would i like address first justice stevens pers asserting trial irrespective whether preexisting plan still satisfies terms exemption and reason is bona fide employee benefit plan designed evade designed subterfuge evade purposes act the act first foremost mechanism insuring employment older workers and certainly public employees retirement system ohio way interfere employment it insures no your honor and certainly pers it doesnt affect way salary employment everyday sorts things come working all says it makes distinction based age respect employee benefit plans and pers freely admits wasnt 4f2 exemption would problem pers terms satisfying terms adea but 4f2 exception it intended permit discrimination area employee benefit plans now one big points made pers didnt put evidence well court might recognize pers ohio one states doesnt legislative history so cant go back figure exactly general assembly thinking 1933 even could find anybody around assembly time so would urge court public plan go kind inquiry would analyzing validity statute it look see sort rational basis sort legitimate basis ohio and its shrouded mystery ohio created retirement plan started figuring people going to work certain number years certain age retire and district court discovered states clearly opinion ohio provided benefit employee disabled employee wasnt old enough satisfy age service gave benefit now i dont know thats arbitrary age discrimination it wasnt intended to affect employment older workers it wasnt intended affect salaries it 4t2 says and i tell ohio piece legislation would considered model clarity we disagree mr laufman poorly designed statute think says says and hes right if instance karlen case plan certainly designed provide retirement benefits circuit court unearthed possibility designed force older workers leave jobs that would subterfuge or reduced salaries used mechanism reduce salaries but i think one look designed evade designed evade restrictions employment compensation compensation offered employee benefit plan and thats pers its retirement plan and waiting congress done past express legislation they came in 74 passed erisa deal pension battle jacob javits i see time thank mr chief justice the honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock,380.0,583,31,was point passed court appeals mr laufman so youre arguing alternative basis affirming may i ask point new plan amended the age 60 cutoff disability benefits plan start but discrimination although dramatic plan though and also true i mean discrimination pre60 post60 people was also true change disability retirees received larger benefit a person amount seniority client well wait minute just i want sure i understand right 76 amendment client had age seniority retired done 1976 would would discrimination present in words would made getting disability pension retirement pension well question gets three hundred would gotten 350 gets 160 yeah i see the disability increase 30 percent salary great i mean would no basically difference if agreed submission amendment preact plan wouldnt deal question whether 78 amendment limited opponent suggests broad suggest but would deal question future much amendment much do suggestion to would answer future or people run plans going going figure figure go making amendments the states right right right right plans i mean i assume if come way want us itd big problem anyone contemplating change a plan that currently qualifies for mcmann exemption uhhuh suppose youre right 78 amendment destroys argument that old plan subterfuge well youd still show subterfuge and youd cost benefit basis so get eventually is language rely 4f2 that cost justification otherwise subterfuge yes but thats one i dont know convince court contrary words act to require costbenefit i mean cost justification arent guidelines have changed mr laufman what appellant says i think language seems to support is regulations safe harbors they offering the person wanted set plans one way perfectly safe know that it could possibly held subterfuge but that didnt set forth a requirement order order get exemption safe harbor if could get sure but may ways getting well thats under eeoc regulations produce cost justification take question intent so couldnt go behind cost justification say well really conference committee ohio legislature someone said lets pass dont like old people may i ask mr laufman does everyone agree i guess must burden proof subterfuge issue proponent plan rather person claims subterfuge well i still affirmative defense show bona fide seniority system say president company gets stand says subterfuge didnt adopt any agerelated reason like old people would burden shifts i mean im really asking suppose assuming cost issue get proving costs noncosts well moment ago said going cost penny i mean theres said case perfectly obvious theres cost defense you said earlier oh i thought indicated that really wasnt cost 60 60 age thing perfectly obviously arbitrary i thought i may misunderstood i thought earlier argument said perfectly obvious would cost penny something like remove the age 60 cutoff right i see the court said wasnt subterfuge didnt and equivalent saying without costs subterfuge is court appeals meant say why didnt say i admit thats very queer way say if thats mind i mean i mean could said observe terms bona fide seniority system bona fide employee benefit plan discrimination costbased something like if meant say say meant say poorly drafted may i ask another question language i find puzzling it talks bona fide system subterfuge does indicate bona fide systems subterfuges its baffling you dont do language mcmann dont need business purpose economic justification thank mr laufman mr wright well isnt employment also insure equal treatment they get employed isnt isnt you put all older people closet say youre hired tell us what make subterfuge what thank mr sutter the case submitted,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,426.0,557,6,mr chief justice may please court its important keep mind mr laufman pointed ohio failed produce agerelated cost justification discrimination produced justification whatsoever both department labor administered act 1979 eeoc administered since agreed section 4f2 wideopen authorization discriminate ohio contends rather agencies agreed statute requires employees justify discrimination usually showing costs provide benefits older employees not sense life insurance example if agerelated cost justification mean term life insurance example much congress mind 1967 think extends beyond but let add always clear extends beyond if i may digress briefly legislative history answer question the 1967 legislative history let make clear 1967 1978 im talking clearly two problems congress mind one benefits term life insurance cost provide older employees younger employees congress wanted allow employers spend amount older employees even though would discriminated would receive lesser benefit also congress mind made clear colloquy senator javits drafted section 4f2 senator yarborough sponsor bill congress wanted make clear vesting periods permissible now vesting periods fall agerelated cost justification except like term life insurance we dont agree justice oconnor and language well well let let point that way ohio reads way paraphrased it end it statute would ended bona fide employee benefit plans it course continue say retirement pension insurance plans subterfuge avoid evade purposes act let let turn to language language the first part language retirement pension insurance plan emphasized department labor 1969 wrote original regulations like court appeals westinghouse thought thread common sorts plans congress listed cost providing benefits often rises as employees age and concluded congress wanted language insure discrimination justified circumstance now i realize could said clearer i would like point ohio reads phrase statute gives meaning whatever i think congress wanted make absolutely clear neither refusals hire involuntary retirements permissible and least made clear thats correct but remember also thought allowing vesting periods and allowing vesting periods perhaps original administration bill had allowed involuntary retirement i think end statute spells things fortunately fortunately quite clearly on subterfuge language let just briefly say discriminatory treatment older employees justified subterfuge evade purposes acts purpose act ohio ignores prohibit arbitrary discrimination older employees the act prohibit refusals hire and discrimination justified arbitrary i think clear postact statute before 1976 excuse yes thats i meant before 1976 true 60 year olds could apply disability retirement ohio werent discriminated result they got amount anyone else got in fact theres well also also fact age 60 werent allowed recall i think i think really difference 1976 well 1976 it didnt matter after 1976 its undisputed terms amount benefits it didnt matter that correct well discrimination employees mr laufman made argument that fact june betts involuntarily retired result as court appeals stated despite every opportunity ohio made attempt justify discriminatory treatment plaintiff it insisted along section 4f2 authorizes sort age discrimination provision employee benefits the exception ohio states page 26 brief plan may conceived avoid statutes purpose facilitating employment older workers thats limit ignores acts prescription arbitrary discrimination older employees terms employment no concede but course thats correct adopted today would illegal laughter contrary ohio congress intend allow employers discriminate provision employee benefits as judge judge posner stated karlen congress authorize employers take away parking spaces dental insurance employee benefit good reason yet would permissible ohios approach employer arbitrarily cut benefits older employees all contend congress intended outlaw arbitrary discrimination if questions thank you,142.0,234,9,well dont take position employers defense absolutely limited costbased justifications well look language 4f2 together basic prohibitions a1 a2 section 623 looks logical doesnt think congress wanted eliminate bona fide pension benefit plans from scope prohibitions act it certainly reads way unless subterfuge that thats true i think theres another problem mr wright the excepts dont make sense if if talking costjustified i dont know failure hire somebody says except employee benefits plan shall exclude failure hire hire individual and amendment seniority system shall require permit involuntary retirement i dont know either two could possibly ever justified cost benefits so wouldnt say except can think either one could could justified cost basis but would even worry if thought enacting cost cost justification thing there way cost justification could could validated either a postact plan a postact plan if got amount i dont understand purpose cutoff it seems kind improbable totally somebody just dreamed think but benefits would retirement plan disability plan reason cutoff disability benefit tweedie dum tweedie dee but im im suggest seems improbable matter 1976 cutoff because totally purposeless well except except e benefit rehired i think saying youre 60 cant come back even collective bargaining agreement might might provided people illness automatically come back why isnt significant discrimination well i think conceded plan adopted today would illegal dont concede oh dont thank mr wright mr sutter rebuttal you four minutes remaining,-7,-14,342.0,-188.0

prohibition sex discrimination requires schools remedy address student student sexual harassment the eleventh circuit decided title ix imposes obligations schools remedy type discrimination matter severe pervasive harassment matter cognizant school officials are matter capable officials remedying harassment under blanket rule schools simply cannot held accountable title ix either court administrative enforcement context for refusing address discrimination this result cannot squared title ix courts interpretations statute no your honor the legal framework developed area provides standards determining constitutes sexual harassment isnt sexual harassment first i would recommend looking title vii standards the court said gebser title vii standards inform whether sex sexual harassment sex discrimination title ix and standards particular instance isnt sexual harassment unless severe pervasive unless sufficiently unless objectively offensive reasonable person unless offensive person experienced sexual harassment its pervasive severe but doesnt always well department education applied title vii standards given consideration would apply education context so recommend school officials use age appropriate measures but important we understand concern think first title vii standards wouldnt apply wholesale education context they would would inform analysis sexual harassment first instance and second thing title ix doesnt require schools successful addressing student student sexual harassment in words avoid held compliance title ix school would need take reasonable steps remedy address sexual harassment were suggesting federal standards school behavior we suggesting well talking federal statute federal statute imposes obligation educational institutions ensure person excluded participation denied benefits subjected discrimination education program activity yes the the prohibition broad the parents wouldnt persons control institution and instance title ix wouldnt wouldnt require schools step to deal situation title ix doesnt impose obligation school act instance title vii would require institution step husband didnt want wife work nontraditional occupation public employment sector it would difficult say absolutely everything certainly yes instance well student student sexual harassment context kind conduct would actionable kind conduct school would be found compliance type conduct interferes students ability gain education otherwise fulfill so parents requirements but parent someone school ultimate control well would submit the hypothetical situation articulated title ix would impose obligation schools and moreover thats yes would part in getting back my i would like modify answer question title ix doesnt require schools take specific steps it requires schools ensure students persons subjected discrimination program activity and particular hypothetical parents persons within control institution i said no no your honor we submit gebser rejected holdings holding schools liable independent actions teachers case court asked adopt theory vicarious liability would dependent upon agents if school district school officials appropriate school officials actual notice type misconduct responded deliberate indifference would accountable they would held accountable title ix i think the seventh circuits opinion doe v university illinois provide cabining concept asking your honor liability would would attach situations happening school school activities school sponsored activities and would help i think address part justice scalias question but important thing remember statute require institutions subject persons discrimination courts decision gebser shows appropriate analysis large part examination school responded discrimination made aware yes that true but the courts analysis focus harassers relationship institution make ultimate determination whether damages liability would attach yes yes thats exactly right your honor that response the underlying discriminatory conduct student well well submit that would peer situation that discrimination the program activity any discrimination sexual harassment context conduct rises level discriminatory sexual harassment the title ix imposes obligation schools address if remember in order gebser standard limits liability situation school actual notice responds deliberate indifference i understand so statute if knows it must take reasonable steps address remedy and i emphasized statute doesnt require schools address perfectly it merely requires take reasonable steps order yes yes they part legal wrong im sorry im understanding question they dont legal liability in words wouldnt file right but schools well acts act johnny harasses susie johns action based sex severe pervasive offensive mary offensive reasonable person looking situation interferes marys ability get education engaged sexual harassment violates law and school fails respond upon getting notice mary school violated title ix well and fact gebser the statute doesnt allow plaintiff go person certainly cases that court decided counsel look underlying discrimination look the actions person alleged done harassment if i wouldnt say every circumstance i think way hypothetical i would say answer parents hand standing outside doors computer lab saying female students shall enter in plain view school officials school might liable would denying female students ability benefit education program activity moreover subjecting discrimination so answer youre right say parents actions parents never basis liability title ix circumstances yes a correct we dont think teasing simple teasing students would constitute sexual harassment b its basis sex i mean theyre girls theyre boys severe its pervasive its it it wouldnt always sexual harassment indeed many policies procedures schools yes well would say starting point legal framework developed provide way of analyzing articulating constitutes sexual harassment the department education used standards said take look use age appropriate way and articulated example severe determining whether behavior severe schools look the number instances occurred whos harassing in context may difference analysis based whether teacher harassing whether another student harassing,608.0,880,22,well hear argument first morning no 97843 aurelia davis v monroe county board education ms williams may i ask ms williams would propose cabin cause action agree im sure school children nationwide tease little boys tease little girls forth throughout years school and every one incidents going lead kind lawsuit what standards would think would govern cabin kind cause action gee little girls always tease little boys little boys always tease little girls thats pervasive in experience its severe are going apply reasonable reasonable teenager standard is criteria the concern concern i think simply take standards title vii ie anything would sexual harassment work place done co worker supervisor subordinate co worker sexual harassment also sexual harassment school district liable 7yearold 6yearold 13yearold 12yearold the concern youve said take standards you would remove pervasive problem schools hands educators psychologists give problem lawyers judges now i dont think latter right group people solve perhaps perhaps isnt but i want bring open i think problem problem i want know anything could say would reassure others would ive said may case i think every school district nation adopt guidelines codes weve suggested employers do think suggestion congressional debates text statute would federal standards school behavior every classroom country i thought federal statute talking now lets lets lets careful if youre going standards theyre federal standards thank do really think it imposes obligation educational institutions prevent anyone denied benefits excluded participation thats requires every school district well what parents benighted may decide dont want daughter study science think girls shouldnt study science title ix makes responsibility school district prevent i i suppose the parents control institution extent institution decides course ultimately student take and institution knows parent is depriving child taking science parents feel girl shouldnt science surely institution prevent so think language cannot read literally it fact mean one says one shall deprived benefits subjected discrimination doesnt mean responsibility school assure absolutely that result so question draw line its question draw line you acknowledge theyre responsible eliminating effects parental discrimination parental desires question us whether responsible eliminating effects the childrens desires and i dont i dont know absolutely clear that theres line two so parents determination that child shouldnt take science the parent school control courses child takes well in case sexual harassment i take school duty call parent and tell parent control child correct all right why justice scalias hypothetical doesnt school duty call parent say impose racial sexual gender stereotypes the child i dont think youre answering question well neither student every situation is possible title ix liability requires action harassment done agent school district in gebser course teacher teacher agent district so certainly possible liability would focused agents district liability district would depend upon actions agent no it required intentional action school district also happened involve action agent and im asking whether required knowledge and neglect school district control behavior knows improper agent anyone could stranger coming parent frequently comes school says insulting things children would school district liable thats right carried agent school wit teacher ms williams i thought position theres responsibility child way might teacher repeated notice it schools nonresponse it schools conduct fifth grade harassers conduct renders the district liable but but response blameworthy school obligation act if obligation act failure respond shouldnt subject liability why obligation act respect two little kids teasing respect parent who decides child shall take particular courses the statute requires discrimination under program it prohibits discrimination education program i always thought program meant program discriminated program stopped know contractors students parents students discriminating i wouldnt consider discrimination program any failure program prevent discrimination power prevent constitutes discrimination program whether whether agents whatever discrimination public large school prevent must prevent but knows it must prevent and think that conveyed language discrimination program the students committing legal wrong in usual sexual harassment case there battery in cases mind students arent committing legal wrong they committing legal wrong federal law they liability johnny harasses mary that legal wrong part johnny all right its odd unusual unknown scheme impute liability principal act wrong done actor but has legal liability statute and that applies parents well i mean parents dont want daughters take science dont their sons take ballet the thats okay but school power determine whether children take ballet science effect stop parents from i dont know wicked action whatever action considered let ask definitional question lets assume get point saying student student behavior predicate schools obligation how does school define guidelines formal informal the concept harassment amounts discrimination put distinguished simply from teasing may pervasive i mean first grade boys tease girls girls vice versa i presume supposed subject effect enforceable federal standard but would a i correct assuming view would b i correct could give idea would state definitional line divides one but it basis sex though well i mean know little gangs form schools pervasive distressing kids and done sexual basis its done the receivers girls boys givers vice boys or girls so pervasive and certainly basis sex but i presume still would draw line right how whats state line time getting short but thats part problem title vii standards work place im sure kind behavior occurs schools children would actionable so apply student context thank ms williams ms underwood well hear you,864.0,1278,27,mr chief justice may please court the petitioner asking court create private claim damages title ix applying adult

perfectly clear thats rule policy but fact boys decide want the field 2 hours theyre going let girls and and athletic director knows nothing and says well rule equal time is cause action is discrimination violation statute misconduct adult hypothetical adult nothing fully informed happened and result conduct week week week exclusive use athletic facility would view violate statute what view hypothetical that wouldnt would violate title ix well youve given two answers is violation title ix no state not even purposes injunctive relief say school put teacher field make sure girls equal time i dont follow i mean violation statute ocr enforce if violation statute cant enforce no cant enforce anything given answer justice stevens violation so if i understand answer justice stevens could never injunctive action is correct and would true even if action boy students block admission girls science class group students said going let girls out and teacher knows principal knows girls dont get take class want take no violation title ix injunctive relief possible instance federal officials how could get relief violation statute oh raised eyebrow you mean you can muscle even though really violation they snap attention well you dont want us sanction sort thing laughter is possible what gebser focused course concept school district actual knowledge problem deliberately indifferent liability now offer kind standard it isnt negligence standard well whats wrong i understand what exactly i assume situation justice stevens hypothetical the male students making use a school facility example holding gates shut something sort i assume could say responsibility coach whoever authority field keep gate open regardless regardless male students i mean in situations least would able find affirmative action part agent school causing these young women excluded athletic facilities and youd problem finding liability something merely merely refusing punish boys something school grounds no my hypothetical adult member school staff nothing he nothing full knowledge he doesnt anything affirmatively say theres liability case even they exclude from field also happen beat something like really want teach lesson theres still liability i think need federal law solve problem well thats question of young young men beating young women before leave could could i mean justice oconnor i think suggesting possibly possibility creating standard thats strict enough stop administrative problem youre worried now suppose combine suggested school district needs actual knowledge virtually doesnt respond i think implicit opponents suggestion maybe harassment would rise level significant denial programs benefit now put two things together significant denial programs benefit isnt teasing things kids get together strict standard liability school district actually know response nonexistent grossly inadequate put two things together would leave kind leeway school district i think i suggested might desirable apparently think desirable under standard proposed justice breyer confident case bar would come under standard proposed justice breyer confident knowing case would come i simply taking justice oconnors idea school district know exactly response grossly inadequate response virtually response addition harassment rise level denying significant benefit program i think discussed side so cant ideas keeping teasing keeping anything even ordinary know well i wont repeat very high quite high and would say thing title vi race lets say theres racial minority school racial majority playing field recess beating minority teachers stand theyre affirmatively encouraging anything theyre stopping there would also liability title vi do we concerned fact public schools event children compelled law attend school act sort loco parentis situation school day does impose responsibility school result concerned might part parcel background title ix mr plowden i may missed description is remedy state law school board totally ignores serious problem no what authority schools in your state do schools authority expel students discipline things school grounds i mean suppose harassment going students get school can authority what extent so sort generalized harassment occurs school grounds youd say probably authority harassment relates specifically goes school even occurs school grounds think would authority of course text title ix i mean speaks broadly it says person shall basis sex excluded excluded passive excluded participation denied benefits subjected discrimination it doesnt say act results so technically words statute couldnt say individual students violation section ix in justice stevens example couldnt say students prevent girls entering field violates section ix well thats one way read read as implicitly saying shall excluded person runs program thats really and certainly another way read anyone excludes someone participation a school program thats federally funded violates title ix you could read way couldnt how read agency administers title ix around quarter century and basic question like statute object statute hasnt something but justice scalias question didnt go sexual harassment its responsible title ix you answered recipient federal funds it the student school well one thing one thing recipient responsible get limitation title ix recipient federal funds i think but dont know whether definition harassment everyone agrees got pervasive its got repeated school deliberately indifferent in survey youre referring anybody had one exposure could answer yes and certainly anyone says would would trigger liability title ix well money laughter its money isnt isnt necessary consequence position petitioners argued federal code conduct every classroom country mr plowden i understand the problem people wrestling draw line rough stuff teasing harassment thats covered but hand i dont understand hard separate negligence deliberate indifference means know deliberately anything it seems thats hard standard define apply would answer racial harassment i mean suppose know imagine very severe racial harassment students someone different racially and cant use program to point cant benefit educational program is likely congress wanted ignored no still seems hypothetical blackwhite situation the white boys say field whites and school nothing you still say theres liability you say well title ix cover racial discrimination no im talking title vi and work way two respect to mechanism private right action ocr authority the statute front us written i guess passive voice no person shall subjected it seems that aids somewhat construction petitioner urging us schools simply duty ensure prohibited conduct doesnt happen matter causes thats permissible reading well give reading dont sue school you could could sue individual kids who sexual taunting the individual students excluding people playing field no i mean accept justice kennedys position passive voice passive voice has court ever done thank mr plowden the case submitted,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,308.0,430,8,mr chief justice may please court when principal school learns fifth grade girl sexually harassed classmate severely cant learn principal responds deliberate indifference student subjected discrimination basis sex schools educational program and school receives financial assistance federal financial assistance may liable damages equitable relief may available even damages id like address cabining principle question table it seems the important thing the question cabining principles oh cabining principle cabining principles unless behavior question severe exclude deny benefits educational benefits discriminate education program ordinary teasing would rise level actionable wrong program well sufficiently severe deprive somebody ability get education done basis sex school fails respond reasonable fashion seems thats i think key ordinarily there deference reasonable judgment school officials but theres reason discussions counseling sessions training conciliation wouldnt precisely sort response would avoid deliberate indifference would avoid liability that say appropriate response school setting could different would different theres theres requirement school guarantee happen the rule school school subject student discrimination isnt thing behavior happen well i think principle draw line recognizing appropriate response school different appropriate response employer no doesnt well course always possible bring lawsuit cases developed far presumably court adopt rule courts could quickly establish would basis summary judgment sort that would failure of rises level deliberate indifference would basis i dont think its true purpose statute title ix like title vi designed provide students equal access basis sex one case race education title vi concerned among things racial hostility students newly integrated schools well racial hostility teachers so gang prevents student essentially participating school program basis race basis sex thats right heart title ix means the severe clearer school respond and fails respond appropriately and fails respond and ordinarily amici for schools point ordinarily schools respond thats thats cabining principle presumably would unusual case school fact deliberately indifferent would ordinarily make egregious behavior response or it depends whether school failed respond reasonably you dont answer question basis students action it i think gebser said schools response thats question no i dont i dont im suggesting theres discrimination student demolished i suggesting students reaction relevant appropriate response part school thats the limitation comes id like point unusual law least unheard discrimination law entity liable act the first line actor under title vii may well employer liable mid level supervisor whos discrimination clear whether supervisor could also liable title vii there simply different questions stake youre asking whether individual liable whether institution liable one reasons individual liable individual many reasons one individual child idea liability part child brings question quite different considerations liability part school authority situation something respond the,284.0,414,6,excuse the question but i take if pervasive know kids gang one the object teasing really is left incapable getting benefit education i take answer implicit answer theres theres principle line harassment call teasing by primary grade children excuse why deprive someone ability get education thats statute says thats separate basis violation denied benefits all says subjected discrimination why i dont know insist severe person cant even learn this true i cant believe youre i mean i i doubt seem saying if x sexual harassment teacher student sexual harassment student student employer employee concern ill take given maybe youll deny i hope maybe but but thats given whats concern i think whereas one might hesitance insisting work place dont shape sued school many many incidents proper response seems kind discussion mediation getting together family bringing psychologists kinds things dont seem appropriate work place and i guess concern anyway is way law sensitive opening worms happened school x group girls bigger boys used beat class right way school responds lawsuits the way school responds discussion mediation forth kinds ways response whats worrying gearing great legal mechanism supersede well continues theres another incidence it fails go youre marching court resolve issues well thats true i think concern is slightly different concern as seems developing principle line sexual harassment at effect high end scale high school and teasing first grade every case pervasive teasing know goes potential federal case whenever parents dissatisfied actions quite rightly describe reasonable school take and i think concern way really principle draw line every act teasing and subject federal litigation well goes goes schools response gets court but still remains case school going subject to federal court action going federal guidelines implicated claim every first grade pervasive teasing incident thats concern well possible title ix harasser must agent school district district must actual knowledge act deliberate indifference is possible interpretation statute you keep saying i dont know say if correct title ix provides dont doesnt severe deny person benefits program i suppose thats right but i agree justice scalia discrimination basis sex school aware but point point show statute justice scalia suggests i understand students cannot learn well suppose student comes home tears students one one times decides student really study hard excel is discrimination but ms underwood i think point distinguishing student cant learn shes upset one says horrible im exposed horrible thing every day im going stand the thing came harris forklift thank ms underwood mr plowden well hear you,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-8,-2,-303.0,-100.0

section 2 subsection 12 bankruptcy act second section 70 subsection 8 also bankruptcy act although slightly different believe stand principle bankruptcy court enjoys exercise summary jurisdiction assignee benefit creditors property hands the bankruptcy court course cooperage proceeds rem believe summary jurisdiction assignee property possession assignee the bankruptcy court go adjudicate property rights interests property gained summary jurisdiction well property initially started tangible property fixtures equipment bankrupt chicagoland ideel clieners the assignee liquidated sale pursuant power sale contained within assignment equipment fixtures reduced cash levy served cash but subject time assessments existed consist tangible personal property capable physical seizure time well courts recognized difference whether tangible intangible property personal property feel government acted assert rights promptly tangible personal property would entirely different case however notwithstanding fact even intangible property feel government really never acted promptly perfect rights reduce possession even intangible property cash bank account they still compel turnover money went forward rights well i believe government making claim case ones served levy seem feel ownership possession actually ownership ones power require anyone turn pane penalty that would  true yes well frozen theres determination contest ownership rights property yes sir well i think performs different function although act preserve whatever rights government would protect rights well thats correct yes yes the question one jurisdiction decide referee  another court district court plenary proceeding although merits controversy question summary jurisdiction bankruptcy court least part enter merits

possession assignee benefit creditors someone bankrupt if plenary proceeding every claim heavy burden cast upon administration bankruptcy states whats  different situation bankruptcy act creates special provisions assignee benefit creditors weve come involved tax lien levy point levy upon property hands bankrupted would give united states greater rights upon levy upon assignee benefit

states well short time rebuttal just briefly mr chief justice the assignee holding adverse claimants cases cited counsel government he holding benefit general creditors holding particular creditor sheriff 5327 fox case cited governmenthe holding state appointed receiver representative creditors well would entirely different situation well i think would become moot question united states would first priority secition 34 66 revised statutes well expenses  oh i think may situation fact bankruptcy subsequently occur alter situation relationship  oh i think important factor case bankruptcy act policy congress set forth bankruptcy act well holding personal sense adversely well feel tax laws wrong inappropriate bankruptcy situation another federal statute comprehensive considers rights parties involved but bankruptcy come change rights respect parties i thank gentleman consideration,437.0,506,19,well hear arguments next 74121 phelps united states mr quaid i think may proceed youre ready the property  talking money bank account it make difference doesnt whether property pure intangible whether say personal property subject reduction possession seizure can actually levy bank account force bank turn money physically face adverse claim person says i dont owe government well perfectly clear discern  as matter federal law so effectively parallel that upon service notice levy in respect talking something like jeopardy assessment tax cases isnt it preserves right preserves resource satisfy claim which function jeopardy assessment part least isnt well arent really talking place merits controversy shall determined whether referee one hand plenary proceeding court isnt argument what possession assignee benefit creditors conducting american deal operation property consignment third party state law state  third partys rights would prevail assignees would say bankruptcy court upon  bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction adjudicate title kind property well i would say would different situation tax lien section 67 postponed costs administration priority wage claims any property thats physically possession assignee even though doesnt assert ownership claim become subject ot summary jurisdiction bankruptcy court property bankrupted formally bankrupted   thats assigned assignee but generally would property bankrupt still would consignor rather assignee assignor i mean if consignor rather assignor would  consignor would still property wouldnt no consignor would we dont discreet well  read section 70 act subsection 8 appears page 5 brief says property held assignee benefit creditors you read assignee benefit creditors broadly modifying property property held assignee benefit creditors regardless property belongs become subject summary jurisdiction bankruptcy court but would decided bankruptcy court well supposing im assignee benefit creditors joe dokes becomes bankrupt i chair house never belonged joe dokes nonetheless held subject summary jurisdiction proceeding so possession assignee confers sort summary jurisdiction bankruptcy court possession bankrupt united states claims ones serves levy isnt  assignee isnt holding longer general benefit creditors i suppose would concede assignee benefit creditors took possession piece property mortgaged bankrupted creditor bankrupted claim equity mortgagee repossess property took assignee benefit creditors held claim right right foreclose bankruptcy court would summary jurisdiction property claim secured creditor i know it possession assignee so  united states claims lien levy achieves purpose thats issue case let see i understand position subordinates tax collector general creditors but creditors i want get straight i understood argument i thought went farther even referee decide perfection lien very well mr jones what would say ever bankruptcy well i know  could  would gotten  would  would levy good that maybe assignee finally distributed paid expenses my question even turn proceeds government so  except bankruptcy act would say assignee subject levy would turn proceeds yet case case galbraith valley seem say assignee holds adversely interest general creditors summary jurisdiction bankruptcy court but government says matter tax law levy proceeded stage holding benefit government yes admit bankruptcy say government levy good would turn bankruptcy 5538 assignee going take benefit solely 5547 thank gentleman the case submitted,1462.0,1768,4,mr chief justice may please court united states oppose grant certiorari case hope case would serve suitable vehicle resolution question substantial importance federal governments powers internal revenue collection that question whether governments interest tangible property levied upon tangible properties bank accounts terminated impaired taxpayer subsequent bankruptcy unfortunately purpose clarity exposition question raised case the petitioner raised least two major subsidiary issues relate governments general power levy power rely upon effectiveness tax levies rather relate factual peculiarities particular case and since i would like outset argument focus courts attention feel important issue case question governments right rely upon tax levies withstanding taxpayer subsequent bankruptcy i end argument address subsidiary questions petitioner additionally raised i think case initially understood clearly taken form hypothetical example somewhat less complicated actual facts case i would post example common situation government levies upon bank tax payer bank account order seize account taxpayer now internal revenue code accompanying regulations brief discusses length the service notice levy upon bank imposes upon bank affirmative duty enforceable personal liability turn entire amount account united states doubt form levy generally effective internal revenue purposes i say doubt method seizing intangible property method serving notice person holds intangible rights used government approved court least since civil war i would refer court cases miller united states 11 wall268 cite brief cited court appeals also recent cases sims united states 359 us 108 as much case i take dispute parties the petitioner contend general matter levy would invalid where part company petitioner consequence derived tax payer subsequent bankruptcy levy now view hypothetical example using banks duty pay moneys federal government affected intervention subsequent bankruptcy proceeding proceeding terminate impair way the governments right reduce account actual possession right subject rights obligation establish levy affected subsequent bankruptcy proceeding now taking position rely upon special preference government upon special exigencies favor federal tax collection although course feel taken account reliance upon long established sound rule bankruptcy practice court applied many occasions past that rule bankruptcy court lack summary jurisdiction property held third party custodian agent bailee third person adverse party bankrupted the property held subject administration bankruptcy unless adverse claimant consents administration now compilation  thats right its  summary proceeding property would turned without regard validity adverse claimants claim would rely upon rights creditor bankruptcy proceeding i suppose cocounsel could plenary proceeding question turns exclusively upon rights adverse claimant rights property belongs subject administration bankruptcy distinction summary proceeding plenary proceeding merely matter elaborateness procedures affects substantive rights well well case example plenary proceeding issue court would whether governments levy valid whether tax payer owed tax moneys would paid government full in summary proceeding  i take petitioners position question whether properties properties tax payer turned bankruptcy court united states interest creditor whatever left payment expenses bankruptcy thats right well i say general rule upon rely property held third person behalf adverse claimant subject summary jurisdiction bankruptcy court compilation cases applying rule set forth volume two paragraph 2306 bracket 1 colliers treaties bankruptcy i stress paragraph although adverted number related paragraphs colliers include one brief i repeat paragraph 2306 bracket 1 i discuss two cases purposes example in taubel fox 264 us 426 sheriff pursuant judgment levy seize property debtor sheriff still holding property debtor adjudicated bankrupt bankruptcy court sought require sheriff pay property receiver bankruptcy court concluded since property held sheriff behalf adverse claimant judgment creditor subject summary turnover instead sheriff free release property judgment creditor in connection i would like refer page 23 brief footnote 10 misdiscribed taubel fox disadvantage we stated footnote case taubel fox court merely held property forth said court merely stated property hands nonadverse third person holding decision adverse claim subject turnover in face court taubel went hold since sheriff case holding adverse claimant property subject summary turnover the case court i would mention first national bank title trust company 198 us 280 case third party possession ware housemen holding property third person adverse claimant bankrupted bankrupt assigned warehouse receipt court held property warehouse mens hands subject summary turnover now believe general rule annunciated applied cases governs case wellproperty held united states pursuant levy like property held third persons adverse claimants beyond reach bankruptcy court summary turnover orders hypothetical example i propounded bank upon government served valid notice levy holds taxpayers account government governments agent government adverse claimant entitled receive moneys account the moneys account like property sees sheriff taubel fox it payable government adverse claimant receiver bankruptcy distribution accordance priority rules bankruptcy thats true thats i used hypothetical i wanted courts attention first focused upon general case governments levy i intended later point address special considerations arise person upon levy served general assignee i hope get point momentwell the petitioner understand challenge general rule upon rely challenged rule third person custody adverse claimant subject summary turnover his argument aspect case simply taxing authorities unlike similarly situated adverse claimants unable avail benefit general rule the basis argument exclusively upon section 67 c 3 bankruptcy act read statute absolutely nothing issue case the petitioners argument confused question inclusion property bankrupt estate distributing property bankrupt estate this case one inclusion issue whether property levied upon included bankrupt estate virtue bankruptcy court summary turnover orders section 67 c 3 address question it addressed separate distinct question distribution whether  priority various claimants property distributed estate nothing section 67 c 3 intended treat government less favorably adverse claimants constructive possession seen claimants entitled reduce property actual possession without interference bankruptcy court well basic legal consideration general issue feel involved i think i also call courts attention however certain practical considerations it great importance united states capacity collector taxes able rely upon notice levy if internal revenue service cannot rely forced resort summary collection procedures enforce immediate compliance notices levy and would entail use hasty collection devices inevitably cause disruption would burdensome annoying taxpayers third parties deal we see social objective would achieved forcing government scramble way actual possession all legitimate concerns bankruptcy administration internal revenue collection served giving united states rights presently held similarly situated adverse claimants in short practical reasons internal revenue collection matter established bankruptcy procedure governments levy honored whether taxpayer subsequently becomes bankrupted the united states entitled rely upon valid prebankruptcy levy placing property levied upon beyond reach bankruptcy court now completes presentation governments position believe central issue case issue court presumably took case decide evident subsidiary issues case i turn consideration issues as mr justice rehnquist noted petitioner contends case governed special rule favor general assignees he contends regardless effect notice levy might circumstances property held general assignee must turned receiver bankruptcy whether levy relies upon section 70 8 bankruptcy act also section 2 21 act that although provisions state bankruptcy court jurisdiction require assignees benefit creditors deliver property possession receiver bankruptcy never construed running bankruptcy court summary power reach property held assignee manner adverse bankrupted general creditors the bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction provisions extends property assignee holding exclusive general creditors time bankruptcy for example galbraith valley 256 us 46 court presented contention receiver bankruptcy property held assignee adversely bankrupt subject summary turnover in case assignee incurred certain expenses administration applied bankruptcy claim entitled take property  take property value amount expenses hold adverse claimant court upheld assignees contention the court held property respect assignee adverse claim property subject turnover receiver bankruptcy outside bankruptcy courts summary jurisdiction section 2 21 enacted decision galbraith valley generally considered merely codification prior law collier treaties indicated brief treats enactment i dont think anyone construed general requirement assignee turnover property possession willingly without regard adverse claims i believe passage chandler act lower courts court lower courts opportunity apply galbraith valley situation one involved done bar summary turnover property held assignee self custodian agent third person summary turnover receiver bankruptcy thats correct thats also correct thats right thats right well rights bankruptcy arose time its correct course creditors prior  well let distinguish various kinds rights of course government right payment taxes longer  the levy served upon assignee bankruptcy one petitioners arguments case second subsidiary kind argument assignee wasnt holding property subject levy he claims proceeds assignees hands subject levy internal revenue code we believe contention plainly wrong the assignee  let backtrack the taxpayer holding property subject governments lien when taxpayer sign property assignee assignee took property subject lien now petitioner concedes much there assessment taxes thats correct it no lien perfected would valid example bona fide purchaser it became perfected notice lien notice levy notice lien properly filed no  notice levy served upon assignee the notice lien served  filed appropriate state office filed assignee took possession property after hed reduced property proceeds cash thats correct thats right thats right of course argument federal law supervenes oh yes youre talking section 63 31 yes one aspect provision petitioner consistently overlooked case fact governments levy reach property tax payer seemed searching vain statutory language its section  section 63 31 set forth page 12 petition writ certiorari provides person liable pay tax neglects refuses pay within 10 days notice demand shall lawful secretary delegate collect tax levy upon property rights property belonging person lien provided chapter payment tax contention governments lien case attached proceeds substitution  well thats one three questions i regard subsidiary question thats correct that important question  thats true now brief cited justice stewarts opinion shepherd tailor example courts application federal common law rule lien attached proceeds substitution that also rule illinois law cited number illinois cases brief stand proposition  assignee illinois law takes property subject lien sells property lien reattaches proceeds same rule federal common law illinois common law petitioner sole reliance alleged contrary authority upon united states bess case case holds the governments lien reattach proceeds fully realizable  taxpayers hands in case government lien taxpayers insurance policy death taxpayer moneys face amount policy paid beneficiary government claim face amount this court held proceeds would realizable taxpayers hands case surrender valued governments lien reattached proceeds realizable hands taxpayer additional insurance proceeds beyond cash surrender value lien would reattached now petitioner tries fit within narrow exception general rule lien reattaches proceeds substitution i frankly dont see able the taxpayer case could easily general assignee convert property cash taxpayer could sold property liquidated receivables receive cash exactly manner general assignee there reason whatsoever case taxpayer  governments lien reattach proceeds substitution since believe lien clearly reattach proceeds there property subject lien lien section 63 31 code subject levy clear governments levy serve notice upon assignee property taxpayer also property federal tax lien thereby seized behalf united states payment taxes demand made upon assignee payment amounts united states if questions i ask court affirm judgment thank you,136.0,184,10,let property away  and subject summary proceedings well filed petition reclamation we didnt quite get last mr jones say affects substantive rights well thats consequence whats going jurisdiction bankruptcy court kind problem well provision subsection 8 section 70 act equates possession assignor possession bankrupt you dont hypothetical example that wasnt modified chandler amendments was levy made bankruptcy and levy wasnt    levy made assignment and assignee benefit creditors acquired  took possession property bankruptcy sold subjected levy and came bankruptcy right bankruptcy act assignee may rights trustee state assignee arose filing bankrupt and asserting rights united states arose bankruptcy but levy arose bankruptcy may i interrupt point what happen time  notice deficiency assessment i understood right create lien not lien gave notice creditors though and filed assignee and notice levy filed i understand sold channels benefit creditors for benefit creditors 4741 beneficiaries trust right yes also federal law talks property rights property tax payer which whole basis lawsuit thats really question its big question hope that oppose certiorari hope court would decide that particularized question case do something mr quaid,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,9,0,-128.0,301.0

claim concerning liability occur agreement arbitrate ended the facts case undisputed the employer nolde manufacturer bakery goods maintained operated bakery plant norfolk virginia entered labor agreement july 1970 respondent union term extending july 21 1973 however duration clause labor agreement provided july 21 1973 labor agreement would remain effect either new agreement reached parties either party gave written notice cancellation the labor agreement contained severance pay provision that provision general terms stated employees three years continuous service employer would entitled severance payment based upon formula set contract upon happening certain contingencies one permanent closing plant the agreement also contained grievance arbitration procedure in midmay 1973 union gave notice company pursuant section 8d national labor relations act intention negotiate new agreement negotiations company union commenced continued period three months no agreement reached parties period negotiation on august 20 1973 union sent company written notice sevenday cancellation contract pursuant duration clause agreement that notice sent august 20 1973 meant labor agreement terminated reason union’s notice august 27 1973 the negotiators parties met august 31 1973 time union rejected company’s final proposal new contract at meeting union advised company unless company accepted union’s proposals union would go strike after considering union’s proposals considering financial position employer concluded could survive norfolk virginia plant face strike accordingly notified union effective night august 31 1973 employer permanently closing norfolk virginia plant and fact date employer close permanently norfolk virginia plant date terminated employees represented union subsequent plant closing subsequent termination employees union made demand upon company payment severance pay the employer declined pay severance pay the union made demand upon employer arbitrate issue whether employer obligated pay severance pay the employer declined arbitrate in instances employer’s position obligation pay severance pay duty arbitrate extinguished expired contract ended suppose hypothetically instead sequence parties rocked along another year two without contract i sure know sometimes happens yes sir and year yearandahalf employer closed plant would say right severance pay claim vested written contract would enforceable year–andahalf two years later your honor assuming question contract terminated our position contract terminated employment continued factory continued operating but closed yearandahalf later on facts i think would fact situation case five years later still would wouldn’t yes position simply that contract employees entitled severance pay simply contract august 27 1973 that say i think point heart litigation say employees automatically divested right severance pay contract terminated national labor relations act contract ends terms conditions employment set forth contract continue effect time either employer union agree new terms conditions employment employer bargains away existing terms conditions employment bargaining union impasse in case record unclear exactly happened august 31 1973 ie whether union made demand upon employer negotiate employer ending severance benefits thus unclear whether may waiver union right bargain elimination severance benefits but assuming waiver right assuming employer simply unilaterally ended severance benefits would arguably violation section 885 national labor relations act one remedies might payment severance benefits the point union never filed unfair labor practice charge it never filed complaint labor board saying employer unilaterally terminated severance benefits i sure mr chief justice answered question i think – well i take answer matter much time elapsed men kept working factory open but factory closed severance pay original contract would enforceable no sir assuming contract terminated severance pay would enforceable contract contract longer existed then i misunderstand i thought said first would whether three days three weeks three years i saying i saying whether three days three weeks three years termination contract right severance pay contract contract longer exists consequently right arbitrate question whether severance pay owing agreement arbitrate duty court frequently said arbitrate depends upon existence agreement arbitrate yes sir are referring arbitration severance pay issue i would think arbitration would continue presumably arbitration provision hypothetical case invoked prior terminal date agreement you assuming man works monday friday contract ends saturday can arbitrate issue i think answer probably yes but i think – yes sir i think difference case well i think distinction case put case bar i think difference simply when individual works monday friday contract ends employer refuses pay last week’s work i think issue might well arbitrable events giving rise grievance filed occurred contract existed indeed employer’s liability payment wages came existence term contract in case difference liability created severance pay contract terminated let us assume contract ends saturday we discharged man friday the grievance filed monday it would position that grievance arbitrable event giving rise claimed liability occurred contract existed if man discharged monday contract expired saturday would position that discharge grievance would arbitrable let take case let us assume provision contract says “an employee one year service may discharged without prior warning notice” and let us assume contract expires saturday employer discharges employee monday but employee prior warning notice it would position facts that discharge subject grievance arbitration procedure simply time discharge occurred grievance arbitration procedure longer existed however employee might well claim national labor relations board employer unilaterally changed terms conditions employment contract ended without bargaining union preexisting term condition employment employees would discharged ie employees year service would discharged without prior warning notice after contract ends employer discharges employee without prior warning notice hence change unilateral change terms conditions employment employee case labor board 885 counsel emphasize critical fact liability totally matured prior expiration agreement gave rise duty arbitrate i understand you say events supporting claim supporting liability happened contract expired is i mistaken that test i stating awkward that case our case everything happened contract expired oh i understand would concede duty arbitrate events occurred contract well supposing vacation pay case generally considered vested interest vacation pay christmas come two weeks termination contract would claim pro rata share vacation pay arbitrable i stating awkwardly assume contract expires ten months vacation pay vested actually gets vacation could arbitrate if i understand hypothetical correctly answer would that i thought would say yes i think reason would simply agreement arbitrate ended prior time liability pro rata vacation came existence now  supposing man fired middle pay period normally pay month week  contract expires middle pay period would duty arbitrate as – say ‘no’ i think as hours worked prior terminal date contract would say that gave rise arbitrable issue employer’s liability created prior expiration  if right severance pay vested right liability created least extent certain extent created – well i think depends honor mean vested right you assume vested right duty people would pay assuming vested right vested right mean – you mean right accrued termination pay earned even though succeeding contract may provide they right long employer union bargained away hiatus contracts therein lies whole point case let put case little differently assume contract said words you earn x dollars severance pay many months worked circumstances shall bargained away taken away you get leave employer reason whatsoever pay would aright  clearcontract right money but disputed amount something like would arbitrable no i think contract right money either contract the right money stems fact severance pay obligation becomes term condition employment agreement ends employer may unilaterally change it stem contract the terminology “accrued right” “vested right” far concerned simply label the question mean if mean accrued right employer union may bargain eliminate agree thing accrued right national labor relations act employer union bargain eliminate right exists labor contract let us take severance pay case let us take case let us assume instead employer simply notifying union august 31 1973 going close plant going pay severance pay assume instead employer come union said we contemplating closing plant we poor financial condition want pay severance pay we want negotiate severance pay negotiate now one two things going happen the union agrees elimination severance pay certainly law say employer union cannot agree elimination and eliminate employer closes plant obviously severance pay due but let us assume i sure i accept proposition  could union behalf employees give company money could say well every employee give 100 end term order support failing company could union agree behalf employees assuming employees authorize union but general right bargain  exclusive bargaining agent would right on assumption union violating duty fair representation yes i assuming union authorized negotiate behalf membership certainly your honor let us take severance pay case there severance pay provision contract expired august 27 1973 let us assume instead actually occurred plant remained operation parties bargained new contract employer said negotiations look want eliminate severance pay provision next contract and let us assume union agreed elimination entered contract without severance pay provision and employer closed plant succeeding contract surely severance pay due owing facts i sure i agree that would position least it would also position even assuming union agree elimination severance pay employer nevertheless could bargain impasse union elimination severance pay eliminate and union recourse would strike the fundamental thing core lawsuit important issue fourth circuit confused two distinct national labor policies the first national labor policy existing labor agreement parties encouraged resolve controversies disputes peaceful means pursuant grievance arbitration procedure indeed spelled labor management relations act section 203d incidentally language section 203d interesting says final adjustment method agreed upon parties hereby declared desirable method settlement grievances grievance disputes arising application interpretation existing collective bargaining agreement” now one important national labor policy but equally important national labor policy comes play labor contract expires hiatus labor contacts and important labor policy parties free bargain collectively utilize respective economic strengths obtain desire negotiations the union could strike contract expired that correct sir because promise strike return agreement arbitrate that right sir during term contract union could struck the union gave notice employer terminate agreement there one reason union gave notice free strike and fourth circuit really fourth circuit saying employer duty arbitrate contract ends even though union right strike period point that two national labor policies distinct  one exists contract force exists hiatus contracts intermingled confused decision fourth circuit case what rates pay working conditions applied period august 27th august 31st those terms conditions existed agreement why why sir because national – there agreement covering  according submission rates pay working conditions period agreement abrogated terminated that correct your honor national labor relations act interpreted national labor relations board labor agreement terminates employer may unilaterally change terms conditions employment existed expired labor contract either 1 it negotiates union union agrees change 2 it negotiates union reach bona fide impasse issue point employer may unilaterally change condition well doesn’t principle apply it i mean apply effect severance pay arbitration thereof well point arbitration clause labor board said cite hilton davis case brief arbitration clause term condition employment the severance pay so union’s remedy labor board arbitration wherein fourth circuit committed serious error are conceding unfair labor practice pay severance no i your honor i conceding it seems exactly said well perhaps i overstated position maybe better explain i would say your honor record clear could conceivably waiver part union right bargain issue elimination severance pay conceivably argument could made absent kind argument i would say highly likely unfair labor practice committed elimination severance pay then point litigation surely pay sooner later because union went wrong forum because union instead going labor board went united states – couldn’t avoid us simply writing check how much money involved case anyway i really sure i think around 15000 but point your honor union went federal district court union went fourth circuit created law extremely detrimental principles labor law us practice field rely case involves money principle a important one i might add the point i would like make closing fourth circuit’s decision obviously rewrites contract parties’ contract the labor agreement duration clause says july 21 1973 either party upon seven days written notice could terminate agreement i think said could terminate agreement now agreement means every provision agreement let us assume contract said expressly arbitration clause arbitration clause shall apply settlement rights accrued prior expiration contract and perfectly clear intended arbitrate dispute accrued right even though dispute arose termination contract i would problem you problem is possible read court appeals opinion reading contract way yes way read so interpretation disagree interpretation collective bargaining contract that great issue law yes great issue law – how construed words it matter your honor simply construing interpreting matter rewriting no possible read opinion way you saying concluded duty arbitrate policy grounds reason rather terms contract that would conclusion way i would read decision cannot read contract conclude arbitration agreement end august 27 1973 well words court appeals opinion indicates understood contract promise arbitrate even contract right arguably vested might call contract and issue whether vested yes well i think way i read fourth circuit’s opinion i suppose read different ways different people way i read it says court agrees agreement arbitrate ended contract terminated court’s rationale certain rights labor agreement call accrued rights flow contract hence even though agreement arbitrate ended rights nevertheless subject arbitration flow contract i read court’s opinion saying they say court thing wiley piano case well piano  let us take piano case it tough case wiley tougher i much trouble piano case piano case plant closed employees terminated demand rehire new plant french lick indiana made refusal employer agree rehiring facts occurred contract ended the thing occurred afterward fact rehire people french lick in words your honor piano case would analogous case – i know dispute arose time face contract expired including agreement arbitrate it depends i think — is right well i would put way i would say dispute arose case contract ended at time refusal hire — the contract ended the contract ended time arbitration demanded that correct sir at time face duty arbitrate contract expired if read piano workers way — it tough case it tough case us correct i think case would analogous piano workers facts case prior august 27 1973 ie prior ending date contract company closed plant the company terminated employees union made demand severance pay the contract ends company refuses pay severance pay it compares wiley well honor wiley course distinguished ways situation  inaudible no wiley your honor operative facts events dispute arose occur contract ended wiley interscience merged agreement ended four months ended wiley refused honor provisions interscience contract contract ended the union filed grievances provisions contract contract ended wiley refused process grievances contract ended suit compel arbitration section 301 occurred contract ended so sense case quite different case gives us trouble court’s language accrued rights union relies strongly i believe your honor time up,98.0,72,5,we hear arguments next 1198 nolde brothers v local no 358 mr bioff may proceed ready two questions do suppose matter arbitration week plant closed contract gone would arbitration continue what man claimed paid last week work he could maintain contract course it contract i think better say get work rather contract if severed man friday would arbitrable wouldn’t yes mr rosenberg we would like finish case tonight get back wherever going,904.0,1328,1,i live washington your honor may please court i think issues clearly drawn questions come court essentially proposition advanced petitioner case extremely detrimental national labor policy contractual rights vindicated contractual forum way using arbitral forum contract provided violates national labor policy that argument course absurd it give full credit contract parties it give full credit presumption arbitrability court many times declared it pays attention whatsoever repeated decisions court particularly wiley piano workers case your honor wiley indeed directly point do agree language wiley applied case question arbitrability one court decide certainly your honor just moment i may fourth circuit rather discuss question arbitrator’s duty upon remand that issue court the dissenter fourth circuit indicated procedural arbitrability question that question presented cert petition argued the question exclusively arbitrability qua non i think wiley piano workers directly point the one part wiley never discussed either argument briefs petitioner element wiley specifically refers question accrual rights realization thereafter in wiley lawsuit essentially declaratory judgment brought  do say time least arguably right accrued labor contract arbitration clause survive termination contract unless specific provision yes your honor you think wiley i think wiley i think steelworkers trilogy i think piano workers i know steelworkers what rule order force employer union arbitrate promise arbitrate here unquestionably promise arbitrate i know find promise intended apply termination contract promise included there indication whatsoever intended apply contractual disputes that point point get notion month contract expired right accrued prior termination contract arbitrated from language arbitration clause presumption arbitrability i know contract expired those words gone the contract expired totality rights survive contract if  question is right arbitrate that question the question rather your honor whether right severance pay oh well 301 suit if right severance pay vested right severance pay proper forum resolution dispute arbitration court i understand position order sustain got show promise arbitrate there unquestionably promise arbitrate broadest marginal ph language my opponent characterized agreement arbitrate admittedly broad it contains exclusion but promise expired the promise expired right vested severance pay vested earned wages the hypotheticals presented opponent argument made clear obviously rights accrued earned right nature survived normal expiration agreement i agree i could agree wholly without also agreeing disputes rights arbitrated but look arbitration clause arbitration clause remove contractual dispute arbitration if dispute substance right must determined arbitrator court otherwise would ludicrous situation would forum shopping courts arbitrators depending upon fertility date termination we assert rights based upon contract well i suppose would concede arbitration clause arbitration clause said promise arbitrate shall apply termination contract did you would making argument certainly your honor your client hardly position raise much question fortuity since one gave notice termination but would hypothetical situation your honor occurred way question still whether arbitration clause way limited opponent showed could eliminated given presumption arbitrability announced court steelworkers trilogy must arbitration unless said court’s language “with positive assurance interpretation possible arbitration” that context expired contract that context issues currently administered contract arbitrable well your honor course question wiley piano workers justice white pointed in wiley rights arbitrated rights subsequent expiration agreement justice harlan unanimous court wiley specifically dealt rights occurring i believe january 1 1962 expiration date contract counsel bound arbitrate suppose made demand severance pay employer said let us arbitrate would bound yes after termination contract yes and therefore strike breach agreement there strike your honor plant closed prior strike but strike — you gave notice wasn’t you gave notice going strike we gave notice i think facts might – well assume struck let us assume moment gave notice going strike struck we struck time notion plant closed the strike would occurred circumstance would anything severance pay the strike termination contract would forbidden contract a strike severance pay would forbidden contract here notice – you ‘no strike’ clause contract expressly return promise arbitrate the ‘no strike’ clause return promise arbitrate contractual issues what dealing contractual claim the severance pay contractual claim everything stems fact claim severance pay sounds contract governed contract court’s decision made clear whether claim necessarily must arbitration unless your honors pointed expressed exclusion if bound arbitrate arbitration clause still existence business giving notice strike we gave notice prior time employer indicated intention plant closing the issue severance pay anyone far understood plant remain open forever was contract gave notice strike we given notice contract effect following time would pardon part time intended strike we never struck we gave notice order strike new conditions we point ever indicated intention desire strike old contractual conditions we even aware contractual problem we know severance pay question you give notice intent strike arbitrable issue of course knew arbitrable issue we bargaining prospect conditions the time dealt retroactive conditions employer suddenly advised us closing plant sometime subsequent denied us right severance pay he fact paid vacation pay some questions honor justice marshall dealt question vacation pay court petitioner saying vacation pay obligation yet went right ahead paid and vacation pay indistinguishable severance pay certainly regards arbitrability claim severance pay claim based upon contract though i understand time gave notice intention strike contractual arbitrable issue promised strike apply of course that arise severance pay issue arose could arise plant shut we said going strike order get higher wage the company said well cannot afford sorry going close plant then said week later well close plant pay us money owe us contract so timing makes absolutely clear threatened strike nothing – but i want clear your answer brother white time gave notice going strike existed arbitrable issue no contractual issue arbitration promise strike applied that precisely right your honor am i correct understanding contractual issue respect severance pay simply whether obligation vested right yes your honor however phrased whether vested earned – accrued whatever whatever phrasing i think fourth circuit stated well the nature right severance pay something determined parties intention the question determine parties’ intention answered repeatedly whether broad arbitration clause question intent parties answered arbitrator if would situation series hypotheticals presented would matters already overburdened federal courts i think your honor asked question wages it easy say yes pay wages due final week but dispute wages in circumstance would federal suit 25 difference claim wages 75 100 i think clear beyond question that matter one arbitration rather courts discussing claim contractual nature if resolved arbitrator must resolved courts and resolved courts would inundate already overburdened federal judiciary what say argument go labor board file unfair labor practice charge would paid we go labor board enforce contract claims your honor we contract we wanted live contract the labor board place enforce contractual claims section 301 place enforce contractual claims but says refusing pay changed terms conditions employment unilaterally thereby committed unfair labor practice file charge i understand would desperately search defense pay i doubt would said filed unfair labor practice charge whether would said impasse something else it easy court say bargained impasse issue they might entirely different position national labor relations board we perfectly prepared submit contract claim contractually provided method adjustment why go labor board deal issue entirely different dimension that would ludicrous we contract we want enforced want enforced way contract provides we contract admittedly broad use company’s phrase arbitration clause clause court appeals referred allencompassing so unlike hypothetical presented justice white arbitration clause way limited we rather one broad given clause given court’s decisions saying denial arbitration circumstance unless one say interpretation available clear fourth circuit’s interpretation arbitration clause contract permitting arbitration one must given credence how long arbitration clause survive termination contract for long contract claims made sense suit severance pay court law made time later way suit pension might come time substantially subsequent normal expiration contract if claim regarding pension came would obviously contract claim contractually resolved similarly claim severance pay based upon contract must contractually resolved even though might come time significantly subsequent time we issue the demand arbitration followed immediately upon notification plant closed denial severance pay i think i used opponent’s rebuttal oh time pass time your honor case unless questions,12.0,15,0,well friend’s problem no opponent time left i hear none

arrested charged driving influence city north las vegas nevada july june respectively 1986 blanton made written demand jury trial municipal court demand denied we took petition writ mandamus district court court general jurisdiction request denied and took appeal nevada supreme court mr fraley north las vegas municipal court made written demand jury trial denied he entered plea guilty charge he took appeal trial de novo district court demand jury trial granted from granting demand jury trial city north las vegas took original writ certiorari nevada supreme court no sir the nevada supreme court construed baldwin case rather strictly wouldnt woodenly think stated baldwin standard six months 500 standard would stand and result request jury trial driving influence cases denied in decision also indicated certain policy reasons part expense jury trials general inconvenience rural areas nonlawyerjudge problems and finally concluded suggesting legislature resolve problem yes sir it 1000 sir no sir the 1000 fine law state nevada several years i think lower court cases i believe fine 500 abandoned courts i think even court i think muniz v hoffman indicate talismanic so it partially wooden yes your honor all right as court knows country war drunk drivers in state nevada offensive taken shape upon conviction first offense mandatory fine 200 maximum 1000 there mandatory incarceration two days 48 hours community service dressed distinctive garb identifying person dui violator and permission chief justice court i would ask able show distinctive garb today it described brief pages 14 15 thank this front it looks much like prisoners uniform property north las vegas court we received permission city way leave court on back rather large circle dui offender skull crossbones bottle liquor looks like hatch mark thing you cant cant drink not exactly designer and long wear for 48 hours sir its two days says you could stay home couldnt no sir youd want stay home you wear community youre working 48 hours community service its actually like six eighthour days eight sixhour days its actually 48 hours its like two eighthour days so youre working typing whether youre sweeping road whether youre sweeping hall public building no sir most clients want go jail time they dont want caught not six months two days first offenders normally dont go jail six months theyll normally minimum im sure severe penalty six months jail i think yes sir well position im sure make analogy exactly your honor time offenses i anything two days jail 48 hours wearing particular uniform xxx yes sir it choice defendant generally the courts would prefer courts mixed bag some courts said going make choice defendant community service would rather defendant community working opposed sitting jail and thats decision courts make although sometimes defendant make choice going jail two days that would little bit closer case i think badge dishonor if penalty wear two days i dont think no sir youve got mandatory minimum fine 200 1000 that would closer case that might entitle us jury trial because its something clients dont want seen badge dishonor not always sir the courts split sometimes judge require defendant community service sometimes it option your honor i dont think specifically says power require i dont believe the courts construed different ways yes sir district courts i say lower courts dealing problem daily basis there xxx there normally choice i clients i dont want try mystify i clients wanted serve two days jail opposed wearing uniform courts allowed its hard fast rule must one thank your honor please i cant lay hand right away in event mandatory fine mandatory incarceration dress 48 hours distinctive garb well mandatory education course alcohol abuse theres also a mandatory license revocation 90 days second 45 days driver may request hardship restricted license of course additionally particular crime hedged around additional conditions nonnegotiable prosecutor course court jurisdiction reduce jail time incarceration no sir we recognize we recognize rule briefs indicated court dont think need abandon rule served well 20 years dont want because state nevada is theyre pecking underneath line your rules said state nevada said six months you puncture particular incarceration go serious crime the state nevada staying underneath line increasing punishment say well ladies gentlemen supreme court dont six months all six months what saying theyre pecking line making kinds penalties ultimately especially kind case require jury trial we dont ask abandon im sorry sir i understand would require jury trial that probably would require jury trial well cant in state nevada cant go cant go home he must go jail two days besides additional penalties yes sir community service yes sir you cant home you cant dusting furniture yes sir i think not difference sir there penalties one penalties let sir the additional penalties loss license 90 days 45 days nonsuspendable cannot drive 45 days the 45 days tender mercies department motor vehicles nevada restricted license there provision that im aware the penal administrative different no sir it itll probably suspended even go trial even enter plea guilty they very rapid yes sir one way yes sir would upon second conviction driving influence state nevada within seven years 10day mandatory jail time 500 mandatory minimum fine oneyear loss license and theres restricted license the third conviction within seven years one year to six years nevada state prison its felony it carries mandatory minimum 2000 fine three years loss license yes but suggesting second third convictions conditions provisions court take consideration gauge seriousness crime minds people state nevada legislators yes thank just moment this court historically used two types tests gauging seriousness crime one nature offense penalty offense sort subtest actual numbers states yes maam you dont get away bright line test except case doesnt bright line holding you gotten away bright line tests past franks case frank case it it meets baldwin if court sends message states penalties besides six five used call i municipal court six months jail 500 fine going sorts things going happening underneath line long state doesnt puncture line move serious area sorts penalties underneath i dont think i i stand fact the 500 written stone it could 1000 could even 2000 i i agree court i dont think talismanic we really dont hold no sir i think pretty much incarceration factor six months and i think pretty much stood but nature offense the bright line test lived baldwin and duncan cases but youve got residuum test lives beyond nature offense test lower courts found many lower courts found found fact serious crime nature offense serious in baldwin example footnote 6 incarceration excess six months carried right jury trial and footnote per justice whiter overruling clawans colts and duncan preceded two years sentences six months offense otherwise qualifies petty offense and even late 1976 ludwig v massachusetts petty offense usually defined reference maximum punishment and far nature offense course although sui generis court still uses nature offense contempt cases so certainly test viable usable and cited cases lower courts found driving influence malum se crime it apparently indictable common law although one case united states v hart i would satisfied sir i wouldnt want get hand well sir i dont i cant make general statement i know the statute sir feel particular crime serious nature offense also penalty 30 43 44 xxx sir yes sir and no sir im im suggesting sir penalty ought grant us right jury trial im suggesting crime per se carries right jury trial malum se held lower courts what im suggesting court 20 22 states fact punish first offense driving influence one year new york alabama there places punish driving influence first offense one year give right jury trial and court reviews cases regard take callan example 1888 is offense grave nature affecting public large thats dui schick 1904 crime true moral delinquency colts 1930 grave offense that dui and take look mala prohibita crimes colts 1930 court characterize reckless driving case dui petty crime would shock general moral sense and this court may write decision says driving well yes sir but im sure make distinction alcohol level whether somebody else going react differently alcohol anybody else in state nevada well im saying that the considered judgment legislature state nevada two ways convict state nevada driving influence one is10 greater thats per se its presumptive youre driving influence the second one factual refuse test example youre weaving road your breath wreaking alcohol physical attributes i think event malum se the penalties no sir well practical matter tried together the10 also physical characteristics course tried together but event the10 driving influence carry penalties so matter prove case youre still subjected sentence conviction driving influence i dont think the10 whether a15 would make much difference in analogy perhaps i im missing question i dont im fact driving three hours drinking three hours so amount alcohol blood going malum se i dont think that would malum se are talking driving drinking time three hours all i tell your honor the state nevada picked10 thirtynine states picked level presumptively influence thats standard work and im sorry i cant answer question specifically moving back area driving influence drinking three hours get onto road going crime drinking three hours petty crime thats malum prohibitum but get behind wheel trigger offense there driving impaired state nevada its driving influence that probably would malum prohibitum crime low after three hours would event the penalty provision crime fine incarceration baldwin as court seen state nevada moved away fine imprisonment moved areas basically state wants cake eat one the penalties i think important particular crime losing license youre losing right use public highways and state nevada talking state nevada it separate administrative proceeding yes sir soon convicted driving influence court sends notice department motor vehicles automatically revoke license yes sir there two provisions state nevada one provisions administratively soon arrested have10 greater blood of alcohol blood license revoked then later that doesnt make doesnt make criminal proceeding no sir not far no no sir and move conviction and convicted revoke license basis conviction now give credit time served so blood was10 greater got 90day suspension youre convicted revocation conviction you given credit 90 days but theres still penalty involved youve got actual revocation record department motor vehicles so theyve got two chances revoke your license dont particularly speak first one since really doesnt anything criminal case unless youre actually convicted in summation i would i would advise court think apply three tests abandon baldwin standard now may presumptively petty baldwin standard breached feel particular case three utilized court particular offense my opinion driving influence really sui generis there crime i aware really vying serious status none and ive area probably six seven years although course defense attorneys always try get jury trials as practical matter dont get this case lower courts type offense lower courts riddled riddled instances the courts given jury trials types cases and course court said indeed commitment jury trials i mean consider types offenses court denied jury trials clawans case selling unused portions railway excursion tickets schick case failure stamp oleomargarine natal private market six squares public market trifling offenses this trifling offense the cost no sir im talking sir all right the state nevada right trial jury driving influence case now lower courts state federal many courts allowed right jury trial dui cases thats im saying if court rule us petitioners allow jury trial state nevada probably whats going happen the state legislature going move offense district court just like ludwig v massachusetts youre going move right going moved right theres great waiver factor i mean weve shown opening brief theres great waiver factor misdemeanor cases generally dui cases particular and also true baldwin case i mean even state nevada theyre giving dui jury trials washoe county dont clark rest surrounding areas so even state nevada granting jury trials and lastly i think since court ruled punishment incarceration yes sir its understanding aclls amicus curiae brief that fact id defer i think theyre still granting jury trials they feel coming theyre going ahead preparing it and i think 1987 12 cost 4000 no sir well im im indicating court i feel that may true i cannot persuade court otherwise thats im led believe but event i would sincerely urge court grant us jury trials driving influence cases state nevada and i would reserve rest time i could thank your honor ill brief yes sir this court ruled several cases per se jury trial issue offense driving influence is quite serious justices white rehnquist chief justice rehnquist course decision welsh v wisconsin cases found im sorry sir have found court has painted offense driving influence somber tones responding quickly clearcut guideline test thing i tell court lower courts applying three tests years even landry v hoepfner case fifth circuit rule direction applied three tests and i think respect afraid cant say well doesnt apply baldwin doesnt fit baldwin rule therefore going deny right jury trial the no sir no sir baldwin worked well counsel spoke frank case overrule frank i would think losing drivers license serious living life normal citizen community if lose license 45 days may lose job and dont get restricted license youre going lose 90 days and i think thats thats pretty serious no sir thats true but in this particular case im time in particular case direct result penalty,466.0,794,48,well hear argument no 871437 melvin blanton v the city north las vegas mr graves may proceed whenever youre ready the nevada supreme court made point fraley pleaded guilty well didnt stand strictly wasnt fine wasnt possible fine 500 so wasnt really wooden it wasnt wooden selectively wooden go ahead well i know wear oh i see i see but but mr graves do get jail sentence also so position is even worse six months jail theyd rather go jail six months wear 48 hours but severe penalty six months jail well got six months jail would maximum statute wouldnt then why isnt case squarely controlled baldwin but thats thats choice defendant isnt but supposing statute made maximum penalty two days jail alternatively wearing two days would violate would entitled jury trial well i understand whats answer question do think would entitled jury trial say penalty you wear thing two days yes well isnt penalty people well say wear two days plus 1000 fine thats maximum penalty would entitle jury you think well i i sympathize i youre telling something new i thought statutes couldnt force anybody judge could force anybody wear that it defendants option well statute say doesnt i thought it says option it doesnt say option when say courts mean various courts nevada where statute how read im sorry point important im i think different case if somebody forced wear thing however long at least i think different 0 well going take lot time you rebuttal like i i didnt mean i thought youd right hard you course dont recognize rule charge less six months need jury trial you dont recognize rule xxx now explain different well would six months two days house arrest bad two six months two days house arrest yes its whats difference one stay home he doesnt wear but didnt say could wear two days but doesnt street and thats enough jury trial that difference let penalties may i ask suspension if go jail six months 90day suspension concurrent time jail you mean but say youre convicted january 1 judge enters order sends jail six months when license suspended so suspension im trying find suspension would completed finished six months jail but speaking first conviction case well it pretty serious course incidentally statute petition cert need mr graves didnt baldwin case really move a bright line test and get away well meets baldwin sense well dont think adjust 500 inflation when did whats inflation rate since picked 500 i mean i know constitution says many dollars for civil civil jury i really dont think court opinions written stone constitution so 500 maybe 1000 equivalent nowadays 500 baldwin didnt say anything fine i i assume youd satisfied penalty minimum 25 years given jury trial well i wondering way going argument if serious penalty is argument well cant raise penalty in fact malum prohibitum isnt whats alcohol level is case everyone this amount alcohol blood necessarily impaired i thought level set point someone could even greater immunity effect alcohol people get picked tough luck and i would consider malum prohibitum i mean fall falling drunk youre driving malum se alcohol level certain point someone else might affected arent consider malum se well youre saying malum se point whatever the thing blood is youre saying legislature makes unlawful malum se well then convince having10 blood necessarily that reasonable person no honorable person would consider driving with10 i dont know thats true i think thats thats number picked good deal of safety margin to embrace people may indeed affected level xxx im trying figure i guess heinous this crime viewed by citizenry convicted means falling drunk driving yes id say thats pretty pretty heinous thing but suppose state passes law says dont want people roads anything drink set level know real minimum you shouldnt drink alcohol within three hours drive now would consider malum se violate law thats right the state says taking chances nobody alcohol blood no drinks within three hours driving yes would malum se well youve got tell why10 you convince that10 really means that average least average person is seriously impaired inaudible call driving influence would alcohol blood is license revoked criminal proceeding separate administrative proceeding well really isnt criminal penalty many senses word well i i thought said moment ago license could revoked trial now say courts riddled cases youre speaking nevada courts lets talk nevada shall washoe county granting jury trials opinion supreme court nevada case we cant take judicial notice facts amicus brief well telling us thank mr graves mr zalaoras well hear youll could speak little bit mr graves do want us change baldwin yet use lose drivers license driving expired license i mean wouldnt criminal proceeding thank mr graves the case submitted,1039.0,1482,10,mr chief justice may please court at outset i wish point issue raised earlier regard dui punishment provisions nevada set statute punishment statute full set nevada attorney general amicus brief appendix a pages la 2a and essentially provides courts discretion whether allow defendant convicted defendant perform 48 hours community service wearing distinctive garb whether serve minimum twoday jail sentence that literally statute provides in i think no it clearly serves couple functions one deterrence others i would submit would person wearing yes is your honors question would offense still serious offense constitutional context not rulings court would i believe thats court would hold present not particularly not particularly i seriously doubt although i accept hypothetical state would make serious offense i may way analogy state statutory scheme nevada misdemeanor annoying minor offense characteristically prosecuted physical harm physical touching child perhaps exterior we opprobrious offenses providing higher punishment sixmonth misdemeanor line so way example nevada statutes i believe your honor referring child molestations theres physical violation i i dont see that analogous situation make reference distinctive garb i would respectfully submit well clearly shameful many misdemeanors penalty provided nevada dui law also shameful i would submit domestic battery example shame shameful conduct so nevada scheme possession drugs given misdemeanor treatment thats shameful petty larceny crime moral turpitude shameful so theres moral turpitude mens rea involving petty larceny offense dui offense the respondent submits decision compelled holding logic courts decisions duncan frank baldwin there three major points presentation first bright line test baldwin established six months incarceration threshold petty serious offenses this rule easily identified ready readily applied it lends uniform application throughout thats correct oh your honor its clearly criminal prosecution nevada law break threshold established baldwin case necessitates command constitution court interpreted jury trial the sixth amendment right counsel your honor alludes clearly applies yes no thats true specifically theres jail time fact imposed no the level criminal offense defined severity maximum authorized penalty determines jury trial question whether is criminal prosecution thats true the parallel point i wish make argument sixth amendment right counsel sixth amendment jury trial right that parallel key factor incarceration there distinction two accepted interpretation provisions first right counsel held that key element whether offense minor one misdemeanor nevada would whether serious offense jury trial would come play accused entitled least understand nature proceedings assistance counsel its important incarceration area excuse jail time offing get sixth amendment right jury trial there great historical precedent even predates country nonjury adjudications classified petty offenses this teachings courts case precedent the second point i refer court constitutional mandate provide jury trials persons accused drunk driving to create right would extend present limit sixth amendment right jury trial applied states via fourteenth amendment due process clause beyond scope imposed upon federal courts no clearly and i submit appropriate although whether one personally agrees i think appropriate sanction state may impose no incarceration deprivation liberty essential point six sixth amendment jury trial right provide deprivation liberty reason fine amount significant factor determination jury trial right would even case court court demands million dollar payment hundred dollar payment spot moment conviction i would submit million dollars excessive whether calls jury trial issue another question and i respectfully submit thats court time however answer your honors question even exorbitant fine ameliorated ability defendant pay installments work community service however nevada million dollar fine worked terms community service would would match million dollar amount its community service limited 120 hours misdemeanor that primary relevant criterion no court focused deprivation liberty the restraint liberty key triggers sixth amendment jury trial right triggers right counsel sixth amendment that key well i would submit that pales significance incarceration person theyre forced wear jail garb their liberty is confined cell reside time incarceration the petitioners collateral consequences approach third major point i wish make reliance nature offense test untenable these concepts lack definable boundaries they fail provide courts clearcut guideline follow vulnerability subjective interpretation the bright line test established six months maximum term incarceration beyond jury trial right triggered below court held jury trial right is invoked constitutional provisions in duncan case extended jury trial right states incorporation doctrine due process clause fourteenth amendment however limitation extension it applies states extent that jury trial right imposed federal courts should court rule petitioners favor fact extended greater constitutional right broader scope that imposed upon federal courts this direct violation duncan ruling it also because petitioners relied upon sixmonth incarceration rule collateral consequences conviction in federal courts well court determined federal case frank v the united states threeyear probationary term onerous restraints defendant statutory scheme dui nevada resulted court finding frank serious offense constitutional context term thats correct and duncan ruling the application duncan duncan made sixth amendment states limited extent applied federal courts i submit that would alternative youd overrule youd extend beyond provided states now i think frank illustrates point frank federal criminal contempt matter and court sentencing rather suspended sentence ben frank instead imposed threeyear term probation i wish note specific probationary conditions imposed mr frank first allowed travel outside state without permission probation officer he required work regularly secondly thirdly required report changes work schedule probation officer he told could associate lawabiding persons and maintain reasonable work hours i submit conditions placed probationer frank case much forceful restraint liberty collateral consequences petitioners rely i believe puts petitioners in essence checkmate position argument cannot come without overturning basic ruling duncan again critical distinction sixth amendment jury trial sixth amendment righttocounsel cases deprivation liberty punishment specifically regard collateral consequences petitioners allude i think short analysis appropriate especially comparison probationary provisions frank case the mandatory jail provision ameliorated fact defendant could perform 48 hours community service its ameliorated fact characteristically courts credit individual time served jail arrest require additional two days fact served two days came magistrate initial appearance secondly petitioners referred enhancement aspect dui statute second third offenses penalty rises third offense would become felony that unusual statutory scheme habitual criminal act nevada many states provide for example third petty larceny becomes felony upon prosecution conviction fourth petty larceny the district attorney determines file felony and calls mandatory minimum ten years prison maximum 20 years moreover petty larceny realm still fifth petty larceny conviction upon sixth petty larceny statute provides life imprisonment nevada cannot argument made unlike i think counsel petitioners suggested someone may come court theyre able reach level argue petty larceny case well im subject enhanced penalties i commit five petty larcenies ill go prison life therefore serious constitutional context i believe analogous argument regarding enhancement it also holds true domestic battery situation regard enhancement also regard claim social program accompanies conviction dui somehow significant enough elevate otherwise petty offense serious category for example domestic battery nevada officer must make arrest battery committed persons related blood marriage evidence physical evidence indicate that crime occurred that person cannot make bail 12 hours its nonbailable offense point course merely accusatory stage in addition collateral consequences once a battery conviction results court ability require person attend counseling program victim 65 years age older nevada statutes provide effect doubling punishment case would arise serious offense jury trial right would provided but illustrate examples ive explained fallacy taking petitioners approach viewing nature offense the clearcut guideline established objective approach baldwin indicates looking maximum authorized penalty paraphrase frank decision objective criterion line could ever drawn basis possible penalty alone separate petty serious offenses theres statutory description what statute terms guiding court well i say statute doesnt speak theory yes could i would hope decorum would engaged court endeavor however and it may trouble prosecutor officer court it certainly would but call question jury trial right bianton is still convicted status fraley i dont recall offhand twoday jail sentence matter given credit chose community service he took appeal fact the conviction judgment following conviction never enforced no hasnt addressed issue thats correct the opportunity i suppose existed decisions addressed type garb worn regarding nature offense test the reason i think subjective best illustrated language clawans reiterated frank opinion wherein stated doubts must resolved subjectively recourse judge sympathy emotions objective standards may observed laws practices community taken gauge social ethical judgments one point i wish make regard national standards test petitioners refer i call head count states i dont believe constitutional significance although appears though 44 states provide jury trials persons accused firstoffense dui one three reasons first state constitution requires secondly state statutory scheme requires thirdly reason provide jury trials maximum authorized penalty exceeds six months it exceeds baldwin bright line anyway so i dont believe that essence red herring argue 44 states provide therefore nevada case morever martin v ohio court held constitutional dimension fact 48 states particular approach criminal procedure case selfdefense argument side burden proof in instance ohio south carolina recognized two states placed burden proving selfdefense defendant and court found constitutional dimension fact 48 states without questions i thank court,280.0,514,21,why why think wear distinctive garb thing back i isnt great indication shameful thing i mean wouldnt mean anything somebody wear kind thing says i sold unused portion railroad railway ticket that wouldnt laughter that wouldnt get get anybody think less particularly would its shameful isnt its shameful now state decides getting enough conviction convictions child molestation cases the young witnesses get intimidated courtroom jury think real punishment child molestation case convicted ruin so going reduce sentence five years six months going provide trial child molestation cases without jury were sure well get lot convictions worth what think could state thats right yes you think think thats wed hope wed hold you would like result that people could convicted child molestation without jury trial and think thats framers really thought you would acknowledge i dont think i would hold way case child molestation statute thats reduced five years six months concern case would six months it would also whether shameful crime wouldnt just arguing shameful may i interrupt moment quest constitutional question i guess whether criminal prosecution within meaning sixth amendment thats what boiled the six months decision baldwin case and position criminal prosecution now would criminal prosecution within meaning sixth amendment right counsel stake wouldnt to case because criminal prosecution thats exactly sixth amendment begins criminal prosecutions different rights obtain but youre really saying criminal prosecutions that prosecutions criminal within meaning sixth amendment one purpose another so words different meanings depending right youre asserting well thats course text sixth amendment says perhaps could refer justice stevens reasoning court argersinger case explain word criminal prosecution least eyes court could read differently one purpose may i ask one question along justice scalias lines supposing the judge authority statute to put anybody jail six months say make wear this jacket six months think theyd entitled jury trial what asked wear seven months six six months million dollar fine would pretty much pauperize whoever is hit that would entitle jury trial im talking particulars nevada im talking principle youre asking us adopt i mean we weve said six six months general matter youre saying six months prison test no matter else somebody fine enormous amounts making wear jackets anything else nothing counts except six months jail why because weve said how liberty wear kind shirt want why say greater imposed federal courts so what youre saying effect rule petitioner effect overrule frank case may i ask one question way statute works the statute provides i gather judge sentence two days jail no less two perform 48 hours work community dressed distinctive garb could could judge pick distinctive garb judge thought appropriate statutory description so judge thought wasnt distinctive enough judge could maybe add dunce cap foolish looking things uniform but supposing judge really took something outrageous made people work underwear dunce cap something crazy would still wouldnt trouble either i suppose was defendant either defendants sentenced particular form of punishment well supreme court nevada ever approved sentencing someone two days community work kind outfit and statute says nothing thank mr zalaoras mr graves nave two minutes

handicapped children act eha the first issue concerns socalled stayput provision that section states during pendency proceedings conducted pursuant section unless state local educational agency parents guardian otherwise agree child shall remain thencurrent educational placement child  the ninth circuit said this operates automatic injunction lists exceptions  the second issue involves provision i might paraphrase states where local educational agency unable unwilling provide services handicapped children state must step provide services directly  the facts gave rise case may stated briefly john doe released state mental hospital spring 1980 enrolled san francisco school district individualized education program designed iep  placed special school in october 1980 got involved altercation child attempted choke bystander no disciplinary action taken time although principal aides tried work shortly afterward november 6 1980 far serious incident occurred he got involved time argument child basketball jumped child choked strangled point child suffer abrasions neck pain they handicapped children your honor this school trainable mentally retarded children he class 12 children i feeling i going hear mootness your honor your honor first student john doe age 21 he longer school district he state mental hospital the second student left school system actually another town 1985 he 20 years old conceivably could reenter san francisco school district your honor believe we believe stressed early point it present case way along your honor terms i personally raise it raised plaintiffs raised pleadings it adverted district court course discussed great detail ninth circuit and perception children dangerous reflected many evidentiary documents submitted exhibits initial complaint so terms raising really focused ninth circuit made clear issue intended treat length with respect possible mootness your honor think capable repetition yet evading review although within murphy v hunt requirement reasonable expectation recur parties i make representation i believe would respondents represent know circumstances all i say i believe san francisco san francisco bay area 20 possible could children services provided san francisco school district it possible i cannot represent court fact return as i said perhaps respondents might able shed light with respect factual situation concerning let return factual situation concerning john smith after incident classroom pulled child kicked plate glass window immediately suspended school before administrative actions could taken instant action filed district court with respect jack smith another factual history he involved certain acts misconduct your honor time incident john doe 17 years old 6 feet tall weighed 195 pounds the one 13 years old now respect jack smith intervenor series acts misconduct among stealing serious incident grabbed another child neck pulled bathroom asked money took wallet took money child six dollars so children presented facts may reasonably perceived dangerous children and question do dangerous children when suspend do pending review proceedings of course resolve got look intent congress it filed could done hearing could no fiveday suspension on extended suspension your honor correct i add your honor state petitioner agreement actions taken school district we think made mistakes and want quickly establish procedural sequence believe followed california i sorry your honor no your honor knowledge i know your honor i believe initially try handle things administratively kicking window i would think would punishable offense well hopefully your honor would manifestation handicap if i would seriously question whether well your honor matter fact record later 1982 i believe john doe involved criminal justice system go state hospital i think got decide handle case looking intent congress that course important guide there nothing specific legislative history touches directly dangerous children but clues we know example congress heavily influenced mills case parks case two district court decisions now mills say in mills court said something think directly point mills court said pending hearing receipt notification decision shall change childs educational placement unless principal shall warrant continued presence child current program would endanger physical wellbeing others  in exceptional cases principal shall responsible ensuring child receive form educational assistance andor diagnostic examinations interim period  now mills  a comparable statement made the consensus seems 10 days 9th circuit said 20 days suspension would effect become change placement well short suspension trying figure child certainly would change placement whether ten days twenty days i would say 20 days i think ninth circuit allowed us well 30 special case your honor involves transfer one school another there i believe yes your honor i think significance short period suspension whether ten days whether 20 days got give child educational services consider interim placement point realize deprived educational services long school and position abandon child warehouse child rid troublesome problem you give child services period and saying worst thing world put back classroom assaulted another child likely repeat conduct your honor first i think look really exception statute we think implicit statute this court rowley example said implicit statute notion handicapped child receives benefits substantial benefit education  and court used word implicit statute we think implicit statute notion congress saying we intend strip away school districts traditional authority responsibilities guarantee safety school  your honor i believe solicitorgenerals approach i hesitate characterize alternative merit give district court ability weigh matters ordinary injunctive matters balance equities irreparable injury et cetera that possible approach but permit precede second issue question whether individual case state must provide direct services child the ninth circuit says local educational agency unable unwilling provide services one child individual child state must step provide services  and believe contrary language statute speaks terms children residing area talks programs this repeated cfr section 300360 talk children area served we think congress meant local school districts front line they give services children served regional center like school deaf school blind state steps or small district program district whatever handicapped children or unwilling set program district whole state steps otherwise got complaint procedures 1415 child representative files complaint goes procedures designed protect gets services entitled and upon completion procedures 1 ever goes district court district court fully developed record make intelligent choice so think these issues implementing intent congress on first issue implicit congress could meant take form school authorities responsibility guarantee safe classroom safe environment and second issue scheme state provides direct services local district acts manner indicated your honor respondent answering question justice marshall indicated significant aid placed classroom john doe incidents year that correct at docket no 84 document states one violent incident involving students tmr school since instructional aide began  so incident even aide put with respect justice oconnor your honor record violent incident however no 137 enrolled restrictive placement called  challenged learning he barricaded room came knocked three windows attacked teacher  this disruptive conduct ordinarily expect handicapped children this violent dangerous conduct that record justice oconnor asked whether district court balance equities undertake we think district court she made certain conclusionary statements irreparable injury stating irreparable injury shown complaint exhibits we think that kind balancing must undertaken finding injunction yes your honor based presentation evidence court trial well your honor i would simply say that conclusionary finding court based evidence thank your honor,319.0,338,29,mr rubin may proceed whenever ready mr rubin children handicapped also nonhandicapped mr rubin students involved case left public schools system correct well i asking present status students may i ask long interrupted whether raised first question cert petition socalled dangerousness exception statute courts well refer anything specific i might satisfy indeed raised mr rubin could elaborate statement 20 year old conceivably could come back san i mean anybody country could conceivably could go san francisco school district between parties how old time john doe and one before get refresh recollection lawsuit filed posture matter the first plaintiff suspended permanently three four days your honor initially suspended five days suspension extended school district view referring possible exclusion expulsion school district was lawsuit filed done correct was five fiveday suspension expired so time lawsuit filed suspended indefinitely was ever referred juvenile court was ever referred juvenile court is reason well kicking window crime california well kick one would get trouble would trouble would the fact handicapped immune criminal prosecution mr rubin reference statement suspension change educational placement i mean i child 8th grade suspended week infraction longer 8th grade what think ten days twenty days mr rubin i thought ninth circuit referred 30 days 20 days is federal guideline suggests 10 days limit so would administrative agency interpretation placed federal agency well problem stayput provision appear indicate congress thought child stay put pending following procedural provisions statute now say somehow dangerousness exception school district could certainly evade procedural protections envisioned statute labelling child dangerous call want us read something statute expressly would appear least face read exception would tension statute the solicitorgeneral makes quite different proposal us do want comment solicitorgenerals approach thank mr rubin we hear mr nager with emotionally disturbed child i mean one expects that occasionally problem was incident reached point real danger another previous incidents well language sentences considering going sides factors court finds balance hardships public interest way favor allowing plaintiff is way end balancing dangerousness apparently argued thank mr rubin the case submitted,1070.0,1394,19,we your honor mr chief justice may please court i begin right beginning saying fact john doe 24 years old he state hospital it may possible california law come within last ten days remain eligible education state department california nevertheless jack smith 20 years old as i sure know eha extends right education handicapped children age 22 therefore still eligible education unified school district certainly auspices state department education we suggest therefore case moot although i cannot represent whether fact either students ask education petitioners i think young people look decision find happen it may given inclination court say technically possible petitioner come within circumstances fact likely case could moot we suggest however caution area unique nature eha court recognized involved administrative process involves series informal meetings administrative review state level levels either andor state federal review it i think coincidence see two cases come court substantive issues education eha involve children started dispute kindergarten the cases tatro rowley small children in cases least like dealing interplay discipline education unreasonable expect children somewhat older process starts perhaps would i believe would gravamen injury your honor fact absence state policy practice state sanction actions like unified school districts continuing treat handicapped children regular discipline code well due respect mr justice marshall true jack smith within age continue educated he he asked go back unified school district he remains eligible federal act well would time started san francisco state california allow handicapped child disabled yes your honor yes yes your honor as i understand i spoken clients within last two weeks they aware cases coming court consideration as petitioner represented john doe state hospital he still auspices state he entitled education jack smith within state california he lives bay area graduated high school jack smith found insane he need matter fact need guardian conservator suggesting he conserved he living school district although guardians still he lives small town 20 miles outside san francisco we see well i know part likely i think likely could ask education fact graduated right handicapped student needs training your honor i would like believe but i petitioner court saying given judiciallycreated exception seek that exactly would like handicapped students like jack i well difficult problem your honor want put program unilaterally selected concern feel proposition violates congressional intent congress particularly enacted eha include parental involvement planning handicapped children the bottom line problem wellmeaning intentions petitioner want allowed select program handicapped children without involvement parents without involvement professionals that correct your honor they your honor correct that correct however eha believe makes clear particular regulation interpreting statute 34 cfr 300600 clearly state state department education ultimately responsible agency education handicapped children well correct i certainly point we would point final orders would continue effect school district injunctions stand appealed however fairness given amount concern case generated i think see many many school districts would orders lower court would like try return pre1975 days unilaterally deciding handicapped children placed apparently i submit i cannot predict would i certainly would hope we opinion district court injunction wellreasoned injunction balance equities determined balance hardships tips favor keeping handicapped children current placement dispute resolved however vehement opposition district courts injunction engendered leaves unable say surety the fact petitioner says think school district done wrong heartening us however i want point court aside conversations sorts placement child moved facts case different there dispute alternative placement going what happened san francisco unified school district sanctioned california state department education children turned school provided alternative education tutors special programs they proposed excluded educational services and orders district court exactly would happened so need look idea congress aware history discrimination discrimination exclusion part handicapped children fact exception school districts state department education asking could easily result exclusion the fact court recognized genesis act cases mills park court observed cases arose parents concern exclusion children fact exception dangerous children petitioner referred we feel tremendously significant congress adopted due process procedures outlined district courts specifically allow exclusion principals recommendation codified federal law there discussion particular although many many references congressional history your honor fact congress reviewed consent decrees mills park quite detail provided due process rights written drawn together scheme mills court particular notice opportunity hearing right accompanied counsel right transcript right appeal state federal court due process procedures find consent decrees mills parks also find 20 usc 1415 the thing find exclusion principals determination child dangerous and think read conjunction federal definition appears 1401 handicapped children inclusion congress emotionally disturbed children leads believe extricable conclusion kind behavior cavalierly characterized dangerous fact behavior unreasonably expected occur congress congress leave school administrators helpless face emotionally disturbed children no i want i saying could dangerous your honor what i saying children labelled dangerous well i think perhaps justice scalia suggesting appropriate programs appropriate planning made children types outbreaks behavior situation properly occur there many many methods school administrators use keep behavior children control it absolutely proper we argument yes your honor you find appendix pages 64 66 and i believe 263 issuance preliminary later issuance permanent injunction the argument see solicitorgenerals position e3 never intended interpreted act automatic injunction district courts it however intended act nature injunction unilateral action school officials it addresses parties dispute there question 1415e2 well traditional notions judicial power district court could balance equities could take facts could judicial order change placement pending determination ultimate proceeding we never argued certainly your honor fact notice yes your honor page i believe appendix page 64 district court talking balancing interests remarked fact plaintiff came forward  there many plans in fact doe plaintiff he returned classroom case court order aide classroom important note finished school year without incident there ways deal he cooperated psychiatrist school officials there addition aide classroom there understanding i hope classroom teacher frustration but fact incidents this may solely isolated incident i would say district court viewed particular circumstances case your honor prior receiving court order reaching agreement parents i agree your honor respect i believe congress already made determination congress said students shall remain mandatory clear language  yes think statutory scheme set example child acts classroom school districts may immediately suspend california currently allowed immediate suspension five days and cases longer during five days suggested school administrators looking adaptations program changes seem necessitated behavior they time work addition related services corrective services behavior modification techniques teaching methods may brought bear behavior that correct your honor never dispute the shortterm well justice oconnor observed regulatory ruling suspensions five ten days probably that correct interpretation comes comments interpret language 1415 talks change placement it clear congress want completely bind hands school officials done comments we pick five days california state provision suspension pick ten days courts ruling goss v lopez interpretations united states department education we think anything beyond rise level change placement it juxtaposition state federal well your honor see you see comment there language statute talks suspension correct there however comment 300513 says intent 1415e3  stayput provision placement may changed school district may use normal procedures dealing disruptive child  we submit state law normal procedure shortterm fiveday suspension it well issued department health education welfare prior change administration but officiallypublished comment regulations issued 1978 well justice oconnor would certainly hope one main purposes education handicapped act mainstream children educated nonhandicapped maximum extent possible it could we would suggest act expansive providing funding impetus training personnel innovative teaching techniques looking related services sorts alternative educational programs deal address handicaps children one would hope would take sort low risk alternative simply returning 1975s court recognized handicapped children simply warehoused segregated separate programs that course always problem that assumption always made also predicated upon school district offering good faith reasonable alternative again i remind court case alternative offered plaintiffs in fact discussion related services discussion alternative programs ever proposed suggest makes difference in viewing comprehensive nature statute i would finish saying courts order direction 1414d circumstances state department education would held responsible provision services handicapped child directly keeping comprehensive nature purpose statute beyond else handicapped children receive education we submit 1414d contemplate situation exactly like happened 1980 san francisco local school district unwilling follow law unwilling maintain handicapped student current placement unwilling abide provisions e3 believe correct district court say circumstances state department ultimately responsible agency must step provide education handicapped child interim ensure regardless agency ultimately responsible child least suffer lack education dispute resolved thank you,522.0,680,44,that would ordinarily enough would meet standards what sending back find want we position decide want you know want why sending back lower court see indeed moot would moot said interested education  would moot well person us wants right enforced well wants enforced has asked placed education then asking is anybody eligible old enough bring suit well stage far i concerned i would satisfied told wanted case decided did he told that wanted case court decided now understand well need committee somebody represent how done california who represents insane person who i talking jack smith i talking one insane asylum is respondent smith living san francisco school district so case recur assume jack smith going move back san francisco going placed san francisco school district program cannot handle violent children episode repeat not likely either one fine let us assume asks asks san francisco he would move back san francisco first right there lot people living within 20 miles san francisco expect move immediate future right but comes back we also assume state going foolish enough city going foolish enough point place individual record violence worried program cannot cope kind student go routine go suspend whatnot is really capable repetition sense said caselaw put program know cannot handle petitioner saying ms brogna say bottomline intent petitioner  petitioner state superintendent right the san francisco unified schools never petitioned certiorari so talking really jack smiths possible relationship san francisco unified school district state california superintendent education yes i suggesting purposes mootness state california one involved it really san francisco unified school district the chief justice trying help ms brogna i think 0 mirth ms brogna state california conceded however procedures employed respects correct so even state party think real likelihood thing would occur another school district california ms brogna say specifically referring congress suggesting evidence proposal made congress congress said want or omitted  well ms brogna say cavalierly characterized dangerous  are take that agree particular incident could described dangerous no despite fact well ms brogna dealing situations always predictable human beings always operate perfection know but case properly district court agree district court asked injunctive relief make kind balancing traditionally made courts granting injunction suggested solicitorgeneral is proper did district court make kind balancing inquiry think had ever presented court plan would take care situation did plan i see plan i want know plan handle kid habit choking people like what plan used prevent choking people ms brogna may i ask governments proposal accepted think correct district court discretion despite language statute use placement appropriate that seems like nice resolution case allow happen saying even though school district violated law remedy violation cannot putting back classroom right  the district court may give different remedy  right next suit next suit established school district officials violated law taking particular placement and individuals subject civil liabilities they take placement and merely using injunctive powers court solve problem ultimately going end interpretation statute prohibits school district removing placement even dangerous so future although one case injunctive powers court would solve problem solve problem future going imposing civil liability people take dangerous student accept characterization particular placement i agree let us clear saying say injunction injunction remedy exists is suspension change placement is why would 100day suspension change we construing statute you saying suspension statute change placement violate stayput rule how pick five days 30 40 50 and saying despite language statute suspensions may put effect child excluded school length time without violating stayput position is right that who comment ms brogna position correct statute authority school district make exception dangerous child fiveday suspension california inevitable effect school would want place child restrictive environment outset rather run risk otherwise would couldnt change placement child acts yes going held liable make misjudgment placement seems human nature would cause school conservative making placements first instance i think result may get could one would want well cannot get program they get program consent parent and one would assume parent would want leave program likely choke somebody thank ms brogna mr rubin two minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,543.0,762,7,thank mr chief justice may please court primarily reasons stated petitioner united states agrees court misconstrued stayput direct services provisions even petitioner wrong submit answer courts erred remedy issued relief asserted violations this court burlington said devising remedy violation eha court always keep mind principle overriding objective eha provision free appropriate public education leastrestrictive environment possible nations handicapped children  the decision deserves congressional objective following two senses first school administrators required maintain placement dangerous child pending administrative judicial proceedings incentive initial iep process school administrators resist placement child perceived risk dangerousness mainstreamed environment there statute many children risk dangerousness the question whether act tendencies dangerousness we know placement if school administrators told cannot take act  put first place many children deprived benefits statute principal objective mainstream environment would case stayput exception rigidly applied ninth circuit case a similar point made respect direct services provision the childs iep determined local level more often indeed principal number cases least restrictive environment local level if local agency defaults appropriate remedy order local education agency iep direct services available provide the state acts supervisory capacity held order local education agencies provide services appropriate guns placed local educational agencies head state agencys head let move point little bit detail court said numerous occasions equitable relief injunctive relief declaratory relief issue matter course the court recognized congress sometimes restrict courts equitable discretion said given history equity practice court find congress restricted equitable jurisdiction court unless congress says explicit words and submit explicit words found eha specifically would refer court 20 usc 1415e2 remedial provision statute that section statute says a court may order appropriate relief  this court burlington said broad grant discretion courts and submit stayput provision intended limit discretion court may determine appropriate remedy i give series possibilities justice stevens an alternative placement would one would best simulated placement child currently qualification would reduced andor eliminated risk dangerousness children child for example smaller classroom closer supervision might appropriate interim remedy 1 it may yes yes believe appropriate procedure district courts since case believe appropriately district court would ask parties submit proposals alternative placements district court reviewed proposals ordered school district assuming violation stayput provision put child placement simulated well position that correct although state local education agency still would continuing obligation eha provide because basis claiming children dangerous correct district court believe directed local education agency alternative placement would appropriate if dangerous child however school tried change placement child believe would fact violation stayput provision district court awarded appropriate placement would likely would order put child back classroom no part point case justice marshall there expert testimony put plaintiff on either side correct we like state yes that part point like state believe local educational agency acted properly we believe actions frustrated purposes eha much district courts ultimate remedy court appeals ultimate judgment our point simply dangerous child congress remove discretion federal courts allow school safeguard interests children classroom certainly would intended equitable rule issued future school administrators within jurisdiction court would resist ever placing child dangerous tendencies environment child might act dangerous tendencies because school district would arms tied behind back the short answer yes justice white we believe congress no they violate stayput provision suspending they would violate eha providing appropriate placement continuing appropriate placement child now court determine however violation eha argument presented brief would kick would suggest nevertheless even thought violation would abuse discretion district court order child placed back classroom child continuing risk dangerousness yes the qualification iep process eha review procedures process correctness appropriateness procedure determined however court find violation eh stayput provision suspend dangerous child court would authority would violation statute require parties bring expert testimony could determine best could best interim placement would would authority issue remedial order the united states inclined believe moot the reason i say inclined amicus really access facts it clearly moot ordinary mootness principles sense question interim relief children ultimately went iep process final placement but terms capable repetition yet evading review circumstance could capable repetition yes district court held sovereign immunity state settlement regard local school district regard damages court appeals found qualified immunity state officials not knowledge justice white in local education i believe already paid i privy information whether monies forthcoming the local education agency made settlement petition court party court the question mootness would respect parties case the plaintiff could capable repetition yet evading review respondent jack smith respondent jack smith 20 years old longer public school system unless respondents counsel going represent court intends enter school system say capable repetition yet capable evading review thank much,86.0,122,14,mr nager position appropriate relief case would is something district court ordered do think violation stayput provision well relief i guess i focusing district judge come court kind emergency your view done nothing is anything record expert information on either side is position stayput provision violated school suspends violent student whether 30 days 100 days anything else but i take district court case like say well stayput provision violated suspension violent student i got make sure school promptly taking care  why case moot

this case moot within meaning habeas corpus statute decisions court the habeas corpus statute 28 usc sections 2241 2254 speaks consistently exclusively availability habeas corpus someone custody each sections speaks custody custody must alleged custodian must make return  pardon even rules court especially rule 49 recognized continued retention essential continue jurisdiction habeas corpus proceeding when petition filed your honor he completed  it gotten circuit court your honor he completed service  on march 6 1967  after dis  courts it disposition second circuit petition filed court thats right and petition filed two weeks well i think thats error thought  yes according cover appendix   petition filed march 20 two weeks later after decisions court parker ellis jones cunningham fay noia congress amended habeas corpus statute least three sections it continued custody requirement and fact added new subdivision section 2254 provides “that supreme court justice thereof circuit judge district court shall entertain application writ habeas corpus behalf person custody pursuant judgment state court ground custody violation constitution laws treaties united states” so i think congress effect  never question adopted parker ellis these 1966 amendments i believe justice brennan oh yes i think point i could say procedure could get relief conviction although procedure could relieved civil disabilities attaching no defect  new york  it applies first offenders then get back voting rights    may apply licenses might otherwise barred procured necessary certificate as far post conviction relief i might say new york coram nobis procedure it applied occasion vacate judgments conviction i would urge that relief would available in first place petitioner went state appellate process time conviction including denial certiorari court would basis postconviction relief the ones i know ones mentions reply brief he talks right vote he talks right serve jury and mentioned certain unspecified licenses might might able obtain im  i dont know law your honor but i assume   thats true oh i see i understand yes would well i dont think assume state going bad faith   essence well may i say respect case entire period state appellate process including application certiorari court petitioner bail his sentence running it began run  where person jail hes   state releases they could  i would say direct appellate process  direct appellate process about collateral attack state courts state habeas corpus youre talking state habeas corpus federal habeas corpus voice overlap  well far federal habeas corpus goes i would say particular petitioner appellants order secure relief habeas corpus must gone state courts opportunities   apply court therefore  unjust result dont collateral attack way habeas corpus benefits full appellate review not way habeas corpus habeas corpus traditionally method attacking call unconscionable custody once custody runs habeas corpus jurisdiction congress hasnt provided i know plenary appellate review state court judgments conviction way collateral attack theyve provided attack custody i think perfectly view fact administration criminal justice left states  petitioners opportunity go states come court i think parker ellis i think thats  i think thats happened parker ellis i understand only   jurisdiction  thats right i used term mootness  thats right thats right mr justice white the reason i used term mootness parker ellis uses i think context statute  yes thats right the statutory jurisdiction whats important the existence nonexistence collateral disabilities i think properly  thats correct thats correct thats  thats position it may well moot issue habeas corpus case oh its new subsection section 2254 exhaustion statute yes i your honor the supreme court justice thereof circuit judge district court shall entertain application writ habeas corpus behalf person custody pursuant judgment state court ground custody violation constitution laws treaties united states” he indeed custody  oh i think evidence no writ ever issued a hearing held district court thats right  im sorry only thats right nevertheless i would think view parker ellis view fact falls parker ellis language fay noia no no im sorry no i think strong evidence intention accept parker ellis rule i think rule 49 rules court strong evidence recognition fact law would suggest theyre  result view fact states primary concern  i i would like return idea  emphasize bad faith state seeking insulate petitioner review court bail whole period appeal time run ran hes seeking federal relief petitioners claim merits  im sure i understand question mr justice warren not purposes case your honor i dont know whether law new york i dont think im sure my point bringing show time didnt run going state courts petitioners claim merits always victim unlawful search seizure id like briefly say first response this premapp trial would urge point case mapp held apply people direct appellate process passed trial stage date mapp decision i think court held contrary i think decisions johnson new jersey stovall denno indicate mapp brought conformity miranda rule wade gilbert rulings yes linkletter also bar this reading case facts linkletter i think decision limited facts quite specifically entire process entire appellate process fact concluded mapp decided retroactivity mapp reach back point i believe theres  i dont linkletter front i believe theres statement linkletter effect dealing facts case i believe context chronology i sorry i dont opinion in event believe bar decision court result reasons led court hold mapp retroactive it lead hold mapp retroactive point we cant seek avoid merits case particular reason case clearly frivolous merits the facts brief judge foley made quite complete findings reviewing  1181 page trial record holding hearing i wont go the reason i bring fact appeal clearly frivolous nowakowski reason petitioner says brief appeal dismissed second circuit hes inaudible today frivolous absolutely quarrel position the court appeals filed one line order granted motion dismiss appeal denied relief forma pauperis included order denying  pardon included order granting cross motion dismiss cross motion dismiss want merit and  we submitted affidavit contains arguments law its appendix here opposition crossmoving petitioner filed opposing affidavit also argument law the circuit court entire district court record including trial transfer hearing minutes it its much  that would explanation   pass merits  described bobtail appeal in nowakowski cross motion made couldnt determined basis decision third circuit went i havent looked nowakowski record im sure i know records district court  pardon there records district court court  third circuit nowakowski i believe opposing papers im absolutely sure  well  let say certainly i think right truncate appeals accordance consider priorities merits appeals we handle office appeals right second circuit we handle new york attorney generals office usually habeas corpus cases involving constitutional questions would really  usually basis dismissing want merit so i cant say second circuit  i know sure procedure second circuit although i seen dismiss appeals no dont provide well  march 6 1967 yes well filed application this court  case  no court appeals determined merit appeal that  his application court i see yes so custody assume parole custody time application filed application habeas corpus filed custody time application  appeal  writ  writ filed thats right he custody disposition second circuit and  i dont know instance paid appeal dismissed without oral argument i know instances paid appeal dismissed without briefs motion sort second circuit ive handled one associate handled another they dismiss appeals bench without merit paid appeals on motion thats suggest thats happened denial leave proceed forma pauperis effect moot extent relief would forthcoming forma pauperis and relief would forthcoming original record court notice appeal filed would file briefs hear oral argument suggest within power court and thats  dismissal merits good reason,527.0,694,42,i gather miss soloff still serving time petition habeas filed its conclusion proceeding completed service  now point had got district court or  but i mean point released  finished servicing sentence and status proceeding after disposition circuit i see i understood counsel say filed petition it very well yes what date do know voice overlap  19  parker ellis decided may i ask parker versus ellis fav  followed theres procedure new york law whereby man get relief conviction even defect trial thats something applies prisoners   go  relief order get civil liberties back isnt right  yes yes what disabilities man labor convicted felony and stands convicted felony impeachment purposes  witness i would suggest well  then witness take stand i think   asked hes ever   convicted felony   would say yes would well true relief kind conviction would prevent state releasing man whenever asked writ habeas corpus gets supreme court thereby deprive deprive applicant  petitioners writ habeas corpus no i  nor assume it done knowledge cases court many but lets take case man jail everybody cant get bail know yes the state   gets supreme court releases deprives us jurisdiction no im talking habeas corpus im talking habeas corpus inaudible well i wouldnt take either well start either place want thats right well even though constitutional violations conviction mean  right come court suppose case man already applied certiorari jurisdiction attached state released you think thats still parker versus ellis this  really  issue isnt mootness the issue construction   federal statute habeas corpus lies its question whether  parker ellis said custody problem   mootness problem because could well held case isnt moot still habeas corpus wouldnt lie that would go  would go direct appeal released   question would mootness and might  might moot miss soloff could tell section say amended 1966 amendment reads i dont find voice overlap  do language would mind reading well i gather  time i think told us filed application district court but doesnt thats  really amendment doesnt answer parker ellis question instance was ever writ issued hearing and would still  writ still issued case but speaks turn inaudible may apply it theyll entertain application isnt way done yes entertained application issue writ way yes no i perhaps  i misunderstood i thought referred amendment suggesting congress definitely answered   question voice overlap are going address nowakowski claim can make distinction fact bail actual custody well states anyway man cannot apply habeas corpus bail do make distinction situation hes bail hes custody well  specific decision youre concerned linkletter decision isnt well linkletter pretty clear said didnt  isnt did court decide merits court appeals did submit something support argument inaudible also argument inaudible they dismissed appeal inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudible miss soloff nowakowski held i remember i understand certificate probable cause granted district court incumbent upon court appeals treat appeal ordinary appeal right treat accordance usual procedures way treats appeals right court appeals i suppose question becomes whether  consistent regular procedures second circuit court appeals dismiss appeal right manner  case dismissed without argument simply records i know experience court appeals one i sat sometimes  upon motion dismiss court sometimes appeals right could shown failure prosecute grounds but court appeals dont i suppose inquiry therefore whether accordance ordinary regular procedures court appeals respect appeals right maybe dont know answer i know i dont know answer are rule court rule requires inaudible well offer court appeals expressly reject application leave appeal forma pauperis they rejected expressly would technically would indicate  that end proceedings  went dismiss appeal but may i ask another question know answer as date petitioner become unconditionally released march 6 now filed  filed application habeas corpus yes and   stage appellate process it filed appeal court appeals i see and   stage  thank inaudible do know instance made view court appeals new york  without oral argument composed merely submission make inaudible  but motion on motion inaudible do suggest thats

seeks enforce individual must clearly unambiguous apply government acknowledges brief case court applied rule lenity numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing provisions a reaffirmation timehonored principle necessary decide case the 20year mandatory well rule lenity as sentencing no mid20th century justice kennedy bell decision written justice frankfurter ladner involved degree punishment defendant would receive there cases in 1980 simpson case bifulco around time so court history applying rule lenity equal force sentencing provisions statutes demarcating criminal conduct and course green brief specially highlights essence core rule lenity derives english common law designed invoke rule lenity avoid mandatory punishment not much whether conduct criminal so think applying rule straightforward manner case requires reversal the 20year mandatory minimum section 841b1a applies defendants prior conviction quote felony drug offense now sensible reading provision state law misdemeanor simply constitute felony drug offense thats right mr chief justice thats statute books might easier case but know i think section 44 section 13 term felony described defined crime classified felony federal state law  and start section 841b1a uses term felony drug offense go definitional section first thing come definition felony says crime classified and say section 44 reach another definition so think least ambiguity congress given two facially applicable definitions operative provision statute well sense position issue the term felony within term felony drug offense also issue and weve pointed pages 11 12 11 12 yellow brief uncommon congress two separate definitions one single term within broader term statute and mere fact government would argue word 44 mean congress meant sole definition weve given three examples pages 11 12 sensible reading statute congress attempted nest definition single term within definition broader term i think agreement us government point we cite blue brief statutes arizona well couple states crimes classified felonies punishable less year and cases agree government that effect 1994 conforming amendments exclude outlier states take lowlevel crimes nonetheless classify felonies what case well works language statute justice alito well i think quite plausible language congress added little practical effect and flows fact congress called nothing conforming amendments congress apparently wasnt trying accomplish dramatic change i think might help understand looking outlier states government claims got swept 1994 amendments we cite statutes states like colorado perhaps i used concrete example take possession single ounce marijuana that one crimes arizona talking felony punishable year there states outliers different sense call crimes misdemeanors like vast majority states make punishable 18 months and governments position is 1994 congress passed conforming amendment exclude couple outlier states like arizona trying sweep first time section 841b1a outlier states like colorado treat lowlevel drug crimes lowlevel drug possession crimes misdemeanors punishable year so think reasons government explains congress trying avoid disuniformity happenstance according local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes makes sense read 94 conforming amendments requiring oneyear punishment rule felony classification requirement and doubt submit really makes sense remember what talking mandatory minimum and well weve cited case brief second circuit deals exact problem least new jersey problem and courts done circumstances theres felony classification requirement simply take crime new jersey analogize comparable federal local state crime it would classified felony local jurisdiction courts even 1994 amendments courts treated felony i believe justice alito case 1994 thats right federal definition felony analogy second circuit able draw reach think commonsense way deal unusual problem new jersey another all three justice scalia theyre pages 11 12 yellow brief and first place start looking bottom page 11 term employee defined one provision federal federal statutory code and terms employee capitol police employee house representatives  also defined theyre defined broader definitions footnote bottom page 12 and see defined term employee word employee repeated definitions they talk member officer individual and much like circumstance generic term used broader definition makes sense read original definition the thing i think see middle page 12 part bankruptcy code weve given court the word debtor defined certain way later definitional provision term debtors principal residence defined residential structure and again word debtor repeated broader definition think way make sense import definition single term broader term if congress wanted well well might know rigid plaintext argument might made the point congress used defined term debtors principal residence without using term debtor defined somewhere else my well i think id refer back employee example i mean example going exactly fours im happy acknowledge the idea im trying get across unusual congress define single terms nested within larger terms i think thats right and i think one way okay i think one way understand statute congress wanted government says wanted congress could made absolutely clear yellow brief open look page 13 for time yes justice ginsburg statute originally passed 80213 sole definition 94 amendments definition 841b1a used word 80213 so i think agreement are looking justice ginsburg 1988 version statute no oh 13a blue brief justice scalia so page 13a says for purposes subparagraph term felony drug offense means offense felony provision subchapter federal law  now word 80213 if i understand right but i think word 80213 1988 isnt explicit classification requirement well i think latter language justice ginsburg defining drug offense whereas word felony i think selfdefining term statute written and understand whether talking something like oneyear rule classification requirement reader needs go back definitional section as 1988 well says felony law state  so i think classification requirement i dont think inconsistent it might clarify thats right justice scalia well i guess could wouldnt definition youd figure define felony whether classification oneyear rule something else i think natural reading would classification requirement extent couldnt look provision statute yes well dont disagree government oneyear rule serve purpose helping iron well i think justice breyer due respect look way different states treat drug crimes thats im trying respond different states treat drug crimes dramatically different i think common sense states treat different crimes treat different states punish crime differently and thats nowhere true drug crime theres great amount experimentation goes states and one things certain states like colorado take lowlevel drug crimes punish year part give treatment keep people prison long enough treatment take hold whereas states treat drug crimes differently so patchwork whether look classification whether look oneyear rule thats think makes sense use now congress wanted government suggesting oneyear rule sole exclusive way determining whether felony could easily said and theres example page 13 yellow brief what federal sentencing guidelines they define careeroffender provision definition felony quite explicit they say felony offense punishable year regardless whether offense specifically designated felony  so provisions congress could looked would well aware make absolutely plain trying accomplish statute now dont think governments reading implausible justice breyer reason yes yes im quoting sentencing guideline although armed career criminal act find another place congress dealt problem explicitly it said felonies crimes punishable year however state classifies crime misdemeanor punishable two years well justice scalia problem not necessarily leaving clause well position justice scalia standing alone i grant problem see case that left in common problem define felony leave explicit statement whether classification important and definitional provision well i think theres good reason congress put thats continually vexing problem define felony thats congress explicitly armed career criminal act thats sentencing guidelines explicit and leaving backdrop statute classification rule controlling rule decade leave classification rule definitional provision statute think gives rise ambiguity well im sure i follow question well due respect congress left 80213 books turn classifications and even though it something patchwork unusual serious consequences turn whether something classified felony well justice ginsburg i think right but congress could done use language federal sentencing guidelines use something comparable make clear intent and classification felony felony court knows timehonored import things like right vote right bear arms right various civil rights turn whether somebody convicted felony misdemeanor and brings us sense back rule lenity one principal reasons rule lenity fair notice now court early mcboyle decision recognized dealing something fiction imagine offender looking statutory books decide whether certain conduct prohibited but context recidivist enhancements lead mandatory minimums talking real serious notice problems imagine conscientious public defender advising someone like mr burgess whether plead guilty misdemeanor felony this happens states across country threestrike provisions serious immigration consequences turning felony misdemeanor that lawyer might concluded district columbia circuit pleading misdemeanor would expose mr burgess event convicted later crime serious punishment 20year mandatory minimum case mr burgesss crime possession cocaine punishable two years so yes received sentence far less yes the crime pled guilty punishable two years but understand that kind hypothetical punishableby problem one i know court dealt couple months ago rodriguez case and understand congress governments view looking sweep outlier states like colorado government prevails rodriguez case term 1994 amendments termed conforming amendments even far sweeping effect bring lots statelaw misdemeanors never covered prior act if questions i reserve time no but i said earlier justice ginsburg giving example possession one ounce marijuana vast majority states punished misdemeanor less year mr burgesss crime best misdemeanor punishable less year federal law different states treat crime differently and i think majority majority states would treat crime punishable year classified felony  if questions  thank mr chief justice if i might pick justice kennedy left rule lenity dont want court lose sight importance rule lenity case its position governments reading unreasonable it simply position reading statute possible one congress may i think justice kennedy fair way ask question would statute rise level plain statement kind required example abrogate sovereign immunity realign federal state balance the term clear statement clear definition statement used historical context with due respect justice scalia thats historical cases say yes with due respect if look examples blackstone thats greenbury cite look courts earliest cases chief justice marshall wrote court wiltberger even though extremely improbable congress wanted result defendant presses court nevertheless going insist it unambiguously clear congress intent and easy forget given modern proliferation federal criminal statutes rare criminal cases used court well i think important justice scalia cases especially historical cases modern ones i think waffle different directions plenty cases court much tiebreaker sense rule lenity say require clear definite terms thats phrase justice frankfurter used repeat justice holmes said statute must clear even granderson says thats right but reason well i think due respect youre going actually reduce number cases court hears clear statement rule two things going happen the lower courts going find easier resolve kinds cases like sovereign immunity federalism context much easier look clear statement and even importantly congress know legislates realm criminal sentencing needs clear solve case court problem perhaps four five cases docket every term involving circuit splits apply mandatory minimums vast labyrinth federal criminal sentencing provisions so think court rest assured course rules petitioner case congress doesnt like result well able ready step solve problem the problem is court accepts broad readings government government criminal statutes institutional forces drive legislation make much less likely congress step solve problem favor criminal defendants so reasons weve explained think court go back historical understanding brought forward present importance rule lenity case find statute clearly unambiguously apply petitioner if questions ill submit case,673.0,903,37,well hear argument first morning case 0611429 burgess versus united states mr fisher is timehonored since granderson is first time as sentences well rule lenity depends upon course ambiguity term definition says 1 year  it doesnt say anything state classification well obviously one definition felony definition felony drug offense term thats issue felony drug offense could i could i ask think congress might trying 1994 amendment under reading before 1994 offense classified felony then added definition felony drug offense i understand reading offense must classified felony must punishable by imprisonment year what would reason adding new requirement see it punishable year offenses classified states felonies punishable less year i cant see point unless point rule and havent cited state statute brief involved offense classified felony punishable less year you cited couple punishable exactly year year exactly year so your theory reason adding new language make clear offenses maximum 12 months opposed 12 months day would counted but i could come back i looked you cite ohio north carolina arizona punishable maximum term 12 months less so difference 12 months 12 months day but plausible thats reason congress added language they didnt want wanted make sure felonies punishable 12 months would counted what would someone convicted prior conviction importing 10 tons heroin new jersey example felonies what would serious drug offense state doesnt use term felony foreign conviction but what second circuit case say punishable offense punishable year new jersey therefore felony i know and thats analogized felony you say examples a noun nested another definition separately defined two read together how phrased i mean i could understand say provision read the term felony drug offense means felony punishable imprisonment one year  then id go back felony definition felony means doesnt repeat felony the term felony drug offense means offense punishable imprisonment  examples nesting that bring forward read way which ones where just on last one saying doesnt say debtors residential structure youd think somebody elses residential structure i dont understand point well provision bankruptcy code deals debtors i dont think theres question whose residential structure would talking even though dont repeat debtor it strikes quite different provision us today and better example it doesnt quite work supersede term debtor used earlier in governments submission least case 13 so seems theyre comparable sense may i ask question going line you say 80213 definition satisfied 44 definition right but 80213 ever applicable situation what law prior 1994 amendment there section wasnt defined felony drug offense right would take look provision 841b1 because seems would duplicative 80213 yes where would find but read read end read says felony law state foreign country  et cetera well but defines felony a felony law state foreign country prohibits restricts conduct relating narcotic drugs marijuana  et cetera why would need look i dont definitional section contradicts contradicts whats b1a yes yes it contradicts felony definition classified felony federal state law which provision subchapter federal law prohibits restricts  and last part law state picks state foreign country 80213 so say felony stands right is following true right reason congress passed new definition wanted take handful states felonies year ones justice alito talking make clear covered all right but governments right reason congress recognized i think truth felonies misdemeanors defined differently many different ways laws many different states matter much prison time turns wished create single uniform definition now thats right im asking plausible purpose no doesnt youre right first look patchwork quilt laws different states see whether different states define conduct misdemeanors felonies and solved patchwork problem add requirement one year and bite new definition would justice alito said nothing else now thats yet governments interpretation bite create single readily applied uniform rule now i ask plausible i hate tell answer i get am i right i mean i put give chance say im sure i right mr fisher could i go back quoted are quoting youre quoting sentencing guideline right not statute you think think would mean something different left regardless clause the prior adult federal state conviction offense punishable death imprisonment term exceeding one year  think means something different without regardless not not possibly i would say regardless clause extraordinary i would want to deal prolix statutes regular basis if vexing problem would congress incorporated problem definition felony drug offense well seem suggest vexing problem felony defined differently different states and yet say term felony relies defined different states incorporated felony drug offense seems quite clear definition punishable one year if dont want repeat problem felony defined differently different states would youre suggesting incorporate wholesale latter definition but course leave books need definition felony felony defined many places definition felony drug offense so can tell happened south carolina could facts charges sentenced year it judge gave less year but eligible just one you said states burgess crime simple possession would encounter sentence upward one year did survey did document brief thank counsel ms saharsky well real ambiguity i mean plausible defendantfriendly interpretation doesnt trigger rule lenity doesnt how many statutes exist like goodness you want government held statutes level clear enough satisfy clear statement thats rule lenity means do cases reflect youre saying i thought cases rule lenity say ambiguity give tie defendant that context question whether conduct criminal since if apply clear statement rule sentencing code i dont think going able get beyond second sentence thank mr fisher the case submitted,407.0,662,2,mr chief justice may please court congress answered question presented case adopted express definition felony drug offense under definition felony drug offense means offense punishable one year imprisonment certain state federal foreign drug laws there textual basis going beyond definition also require offense classified felony the enhancement trigger sentencingenhancement provision felony drug offense way definition works take definition congress provided felony drug offense well term felony drug offense drug component understand component says offense prohibits law prohibits restricts conduct related narcotic drugs marijuana anabolic steroids  there definition 802 it refers back general definition 321 controlled the term felony drug offense meaning congress gave in words shows punishable one year state federal foreign law relating particular drugs in fact question asked shows petitioners reading statute cannot correct cant use definition felony drug offense congress provided try import separate definitions felony separate definitions drug definition drug controlled substances act broad applies many different kinds drugs whereas definition felony drug offense refers offenses involve narcotic drugs anabolic steroids marijuana depressant stimulant substances in way shows petitioner cannot correct definition felony also must brought felony drug offense congress chose measure seriousness felony drug offense offense punishable one year and actually took statute measure seriousness classification felony so bring requirement back would undo change congress made 1994 thats language justice ginsburg looking at bottom back blue book in 1988 said felony drug offense means offense felony  and language taken congress replaced new language says punishable one year imprisonment  congress chose words punishable one year  believed good measure seriousness this court recognized cases like blanton versus city north las vegas term imprisonment legislature chooses good measure seriousness offense there may offenses state classifies less serious based punishment congress wanted best get uniformity provision provision so take requirement would look varying state foreign laws instead one based term imprisonment and actually this raises serious problem petitioners reading statute respect foreign offenses the felony drug offense definition allows enhancement based state federal foreign offenses definition felony unadorned standing doesnt refer foreign offenses means serious ambiguity apply would done case trying enhance based foreign offense there countries use felonymisdemeanor distinction there but understand 1994 congress change congress made one eliminates kinds ambiguities and certainly congress thought 1994 separate definition felony definition felony drug offense mattered would placed foreign offenses definition felony didnt new jersey maine ones im aware certainly court discussed previous questions may ways courts could try work around ambiguities example existed statute 1990 prior 1994 figure offenses new jersey treated but fact congress made change 1994 pick clear language would turn authorized term imprisonment shows thats used choice given effect the fact courts might able deal ambiguous statute certainly give license create one doesnt otherwise exist theres example petitioner raised violent felonies treated armed career criminal act i think that illustrates congress could done petitioner wanted fact intent in acca violent felony could basis sentence enhancement defined various violent offenses punishable imprisonment exceeding one year but congress specifically decided wanted exempt state misdemeanor offenses didnt consider serious enough qualify violent felonies so exempted state offenses classified misdemeanors punishable less two years and think congress treatment acca exempting specific state offenses shows congress wanted exempt offenses classified misdemeanors way petitioner suggests would done way congress chose meaning felony drug offense think needs given effect the government the governments position rule lenity operates manner defining offense context sentencing context the point making brief purposes behind rule lenity really implicated lesser extent talking sentencing particularly respect mandatory minimums theres question whether offense conduct issue illegal theres question maximum offense maximum term imprisonment person could subject so brief best understood response petitioners extensive historical discussion rule lenity suggestion applies even vigor context mandatory minimums we dont think thats case time suggesting new different rule lenity context and dont see rule lenity case congress picked particular definition used terms term felony drug offense trigger sentencing enhancement provisions we dont think reason look beyond if court questions government submits judgment affirmed,84.0,122,10,is drug nested term it doesnt really define drug do look somewhere else definition is place would place would look didnt know meant drug if issue arose whether know natural narcotic i mean drug so nested definition felony drug offense what do friends argument classification term one year less one year doesnt always serious view offense may impose sentence one year allow time rehabilitation well i suppose might countries use classification common law countries the information brief says two states dropped labels are new jersey maine could tell us little bit rule lenity you want us apply sort watered discount rule lenity sentencing cases and authority after said granderson rule lenity applies without qualifying modifying thank ms saharsky mr fisher four minutes,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,27,25,744.0,589.0

article iii judge lets magistrate determine findings ought am i wrong isn’t job make finding very well mr ringo mr glass,932.0,1248,19,mr chief justice may please court it respondent’s contention decision district court sixth circuit court appeals affirmed we contended throughout proceedings inception language 28 usc 636 b 3 clear explicit in provides preliminary review magistrate postconviction posttrial proceedings provides report recommendations whether evidentiary hearing and contention language clear that doesn’t provide magistrate may hold evidentiary hearing no sir i think embrace suppression  i would think  it’s impression mr chief justice that would encompass something like pretrial conference whereby party litigants counsel  yes sir  there there many many suppression type motions motions constitutionality statutes things matter but time time conferences court legal matters criminal cases as i interpret criminal rule 41 i read cases that’s within providence district court judge factfinding process i think that’s we’re talking proceedings factfinding processes yes sir that’s advisory position it’s evidentiary position not court 1941 interpreted holiday versus johnson later 1963 interpreted townsend versus sain talked demeanor witnesses credibility witnesses that’s within providence i think district judge the rule 636  local rule yes sir i sure that’s correct well i think that’s purpose act intended magistrate recommending agency evidentiary hearing judge no sir habeas corpus doesn’t provide judge must hold hearing every case it’s contention mr chief justice magistrates act authorize evidentiary hearing case magistrate within providence district judge now certain things i think legislative history act goes long way towards explaining says alleviate judge routine i think that’s permissible lower courts functioning capacity years that’s advisory that contention your honor based holiday versus johnson actually townsend versus sain talks providence district judge’s weigh credibility demeanor witnesses unquestionably important perhaps many instances important step habeas corpus matter to take evidence civil cases your honor that’s  i familiar criminal cases allowed going back holiday versus johnson 1971 payne versus wingo sixth circuit held special master case duly appointed united states commissioner that’s 442 fed 2d  in civil case allowed laws i read mr justice white take depositions things nature within evidentiary  as adviser mr justice brennan petitioner respondent cited cases example tpo inc held certain things civil nature magistrate cannot part decisionmaking process well i think can’t part decisionmaking process well civil proceedings i less concerned i  i knowledgeable mr justice white really give good answer yes sir as i understand  i reading background habeas corpus understanding authors i believe that’s covered inaudible jury trials article mr skoku ph also 83 harvard law review defined type proceedings advisory proceedings it’s recollection it’s denominated mr justice rehnquist i don’t think it’s fully  i would go back legislative history mr fred vinson colloquy  mr fred vinson yes sir yes sir sure  yes sir if court please i subscribe mr vinson yes sir yes sir 28 usc 2243 speaks specific yes sir going back legislative history initially statute drafted provided preliminary consideration rather preliminary review evidence came result hearings redrafted legislation preliminary review posttrial unquestionably mr justice blackmun provisions statute i think important court consider number one magistrate federal crimes statute jurisdiction crimes normally denominated misdemeanors year carrying year penitentiary 1000 fine however also provision defendant government agree trial magistrate also course right appeal district court but i think that’s important distinction take agreement parties magistrate limited jurisdiction whereas court hold magistrate authority hold evidentiary hearings would weighing liberty persons filing habeas corpus incarcerated much lengthy period time example respondent case life sentence on habeas i would suggest mr justice marshall review pleadings appoint counsel necessary aid counsel define legal issues aid counsel set order proof evidentiary proceedings necessary submit summary case district judge aid counsel sides project length hearing might required district court certainly i think within district judge  if recommending matter law i don’t think there’s anything  i think authorized act in point fact mr justice rehnquist i filed motion lengthy motion memorandum brief disqualify magistrate holding evidentiary hearing prior i  yes sir it’s contained appendix pages 15 16 memorandum 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 and ground submitted magistrate authority that’s correct your honor not reason personally not personally sir it grounds i didn’t think act provided holding evidentiary hearing that’s correct matter fact make request writing that’s  that’s correct that’s also correct in case listened added tape recording disc hearing taken evidentiary hearing that’s correct that correct mr chief justice i believe that would posttrial consideration would authorized i think primarily would directing matter law looking towards whether habeas corpus satisfies prerequisites townsend versus sain 1963 perhaps fay versus noia 1963 but looking towards legal aspects formality pleadings thereafter submit report whether evidentiary hearing  townsend versus sain allows would  yes sir i think would serve notice parties report recommendations along lines mr justice brennan perhaps i misunderstood question i think make recommendations based upon law judge i think judge  i think question within circuits district judge ultimate decider question i think that’s going changed as i read  i think draw conclusions regard submit district judge way documentation outline report recommendations believes findings correct district judge accepts i suppose perhaps dismiss petitions set aside satisfied state proceedings yes sir that’s correct yes sir yes sir i think it’s important consider cases cited parties brief also petitioners conceded page 12 brief magistrates authority decide make determination fact cases controversies this must left article iii courts well i think  in article iii  magistrates  not many courts expressed example rainha versus cassidy pro forma laying hands magistrates report recommendations without mr justice stewart suggested anyone review much input went particular review report recommendations i think that’s major concern cases even upheld going towards upholding magistrates’ holding evidentiary hearing example  that’s correct and time district court appointed magistrate during intervening time magistrate appointed matter fact appointed 1971 late i recall prior commissioner first three years act identified mr chief justice rule doesn’t provide oral argument no sir i file memorandum taking exceptions commissioner magistrate’s report lengthy  no sir yes sir that i think it’s legitimate concern it’s particular concern  let say i degree faith three district judges western district kentucky however i think allow magistrate hold evidentiary hearing still say it’s within providence article iii judge hold another evidentiary hearing one step judicial process i don’t think that’s act intended it’s like another appeal district judge rules magistrate’s finding fact conclusions law correct go sixth circuit court appeals situation and i don’t think that’s act calls the act i believe intended simply reduce routine mundane workload district judge could address things like evidentiary hearings and sixth circuit noted opinion case couldn’t see evidentiary hearing listening tape de novo would require anymore time actual evidentiary hearing and along lines suggestions i made magistrate i think could reduce time necessary evidentiary hearing could probably almost pinpoint taking proceedings counsel form plea hearing conferences counsel counsel appointed and submit report judge hearing going take 45 minutes it’s going take anhourandahalf it’s going take three hours these witnesses probably called these issues probably determined these facts probably determined i think important i would submit situation would probability proviso written motions request notices could filed court hearing going include anything laid recommendations magistrate i think go back  i make analogy if go back appellate process petitioner andor counsel knew time prehearing conference magistrate certain matters available certain people available wanted get certain issue evidence knew time didn’t disclose i think would entitled bring way notice within hearing circumstances thank you,650.0,922,37,well think section 2 statute means “assistance trial judge conduct pretrial discovery proceedings civil criminal” do think would embrace pretrial proceeding suppression evidence well criminal matters pretrial criminal matters think section 2 subsection 2 covers do many pretrial conferences civil cases in criminal cases i mean say well directors suppression type motion why say magistrate couldn’t hear suppression matter paragraph 2 it seems cover terms doesn’t well paragraph 1 rule talks services special master appropriate civil action certainly factfinding well advisory report subject requiring judge listen tape recording well challenge made there anything statute prevents judge saying  listened tape recording i think serious possibly difficult questions credibility set hearing do think that’s section 3 refers district judge no section 3 statute and submission language i referring submission report recommendations facilitate decision district judge jurisdiction case whether hearing now could judge sat voice overlap well mean judge must hearing every case magistrate hearing well go least far magistrate sufficiently examine matter able say district judge “it’s recommendation don’t hearing” but can’t  submission can’t sixth circuit held he can’t go beyond conduct actual evidentiary hearing submit record evidentiary hearing judge what special masters district court judges appoint particular cases take evidence well i understand civil case special master but entitled take evidence prepare report  submit findings to exceptions counsel there argument exceptions judges usual fact the masters masters i talking masters but nevertheless special masters appointed evidence taken special master judge ultimately determine facts without ever seen witnesses well civil proceeding but isn’t case isn’t true isn’t true that’s happens civil side special master are cases united states court claims cases involve many millions dollars tried way the commissioner makes report recommendations court reviews decides accept reject this civil proceeding reviewing hear isn’t and federal habeas civil act mr carl vinson supposedly judge fred vinson well  think prevailed  laughter as i gather senator tydings gave rather difficult time well didn’t didn’t say response one question mr vinson said assumed intend cover things the answer certainly intend intend lift shoulders judges  lift shoulders judges much routine nature discovery factfinding operation connected postconviction proceedings petitions possible so congress presented two conflicting views seems adopted senator tydings field master i suppose really emphasis holiday get back fact words used court justice judge and congress amended make court and yet circuit least said that made change obviously whatever else might magistrates act  i mean habeas corpus act always said court meant court and made article iii court that’s really gist i guess  i gather that’s actually basis sixth circuit case wingo but statute certainly inaudible so mr glass comment provision statute giving magistrate power conduct certain trials section 3401 code power wrong giving power conduct preliminary hearing mr glass far think magistrates go habeas can recommend hearing necessary and judge doesn’t  judge accepts see problem mr glass object proceedings magistrate empowered ought conducting serve hearing is records somewhere in fact order issued may 1 1972 court kentucky district judges ends says upon written request either party within 10 days district judge shall proceed hear recording testimony given evidentiary hearing give de novo consideration that’s  counsel aren’t occurred which i seen appendix ultimate order recited heard but nobody and nobody verify whether might gaps tape recording erasures and heard otherwise what  i little confused said think magistrate conduct preliminary process make recommendations judge hearing need held judge accepts recommendation it’s alright thus may go beyond hear testimony make proposed recommendations proposed findings fact judge end hearing necessary well suggest example might take state record go conclude requirements townsend sain satisfied and reason case could decided state record without inaudible and magistrate could much but would  basis goes rather far making decision sufficient hearing state proceeding require additional one federal constitutional claims whatever may would decided basis state record without supplementing federal record well i voice overlap i expect many habeas corpus cases ought true constitutional claims determined state record without supplementing federal hearing that’s townsend v sain inaudible well magistrate given responsibility think examining state record concluding suffices position federal constitutional claims therefore recommend reason hearing then that’s course appealable as happened case first time court appeals and court appeals little different panel judge miller sitting instead judge phillips reynard instead judge cecil remanded case hearing that’s happened case that’s always appealable the question whether hearing given directed court appeals first time around would does anyone claim anyone contend final authority in article iii sense i didn’t know anyone claiming finality magistrates’ findings recommendations anymore commissioner court claims hearing examiner federal power commission in case hearing first court appeals sent back magistrate sent back district court hearing district court didn’t after magistrate case filed report recommendation summary sent electronic tape recorder anything preclude petitioner’s lawyer filing request filing exceptions report asking oral argument alright anything prevent the court whether grant oral argument i take allow oral argument we course decide enormous number cases without oral argument know is one concerns mr glass i would consider perfectly legitimate feeling although rule perhaps contemplates district judge sit listen tapes busy doesn’t want duplicate time magistrate put may short circuit process little bit supposing district court held hearing ground rules would say district judge would justified excluding hand effort part either party go beyond magistrate’s recommendations issues evidence received well supposing filed motion notice would district court justified basis magistrate’s recommendation say “no i propose hear going limit issues specified magistrate” do anything mr ringo thank gentlemen the case

petitioners peaceful picketing place employment nonunion workingmen litigation initiated circuit court waukesha county entered ex parte temporary permanent injunctions picketing on appeal wisconsin supreme court first rendered decision unanimously held lower court error reversed lower court directions dissolve injunction upon motion rehearing reargument seven months later court reversed vote sixtoone reinstated permanent injunction holding error first opinion directed lower court dissolve do pursue study motion on motion the case presents question whether peaceful picketing place employment nonunion employees unaccompanied demand upon employer preceded solicitation nonunion employees protected first fourteenth amendments constitution whether court found picketing engaged unlawful purpose compelling employer economic coercion interfere rights employees join union violation state law the evidentiary facts simple undisputed the employer operates place business gravel pit town oconomowoc county waukesha state wisconsin in operations employees 10 15 employees eligible membership either three unions petitioners in august 1953 april 1954 petitioning unions solicited directly membership nonunion employees discussed advantages organization invitation rejected now statement respondents brief solicitation occurred period 12 months the record show believe immaterial after refusal employees without approach ever made employer without demand ever made upon employer petitioners commenced picketing they picketed site gravel pit public road immediately adjoining gravel pit employer maintained place business nonunion employees working the sign displayed carried simple truthful legend men job 100 affiliated american federation labor and sign signed three unions involved building construction labors union operating engineers union teamsters union local unions organizations there proof respect extent traffic used road there proof extent number customers might come particular job site transact business employer the picketing completely peaceful completely orderly there obstruction kind threats violence two three sometimes one the record  i dont believe theres even reference record it may there one but mass picketing finding mass picketing kind now truck drivers material suppliers place business refused go picket line in consequence employer used trucks pick materials would delivered truck drivers go line he sustain inconvenience he sustained expense sustained damage when i say “he” i speak employer now facts alleged employer admitted procedurally petitioners i say therefore undisputed evidentiary fact record when respondent says dispute respondent refers allegation also contained bill complaint picketing unlawful indulged engaged purpose coercing employer coerce employees exercise right join union therefore coerce violation state law therefore picketing unlawfully purposed it also charged picketing unlawful per se existence state wisconsin statute defines labor dispute controversy wages working conditions employer majority employees statute says unless labor dispute defined picketing unlawful the union denied unlawful purposes the union asserted wages working conditions employees less prevailed union contracts they asserted desirability inducing employees join union purpose protecting standards asserted unconstitutionality wisconsin statute invoked defining labor dispute prohibiting picketing unless pursuant dispute defined asserted also restraining order injunction might entered factual circumstances would deprive rights fourteenth amendment conjoined first amendment in circuit court would ordinarily trial court view allegations complaint admissions petitioners evidence taken the court made decision based upon uncontroverted facts it found number one unlawful purpose it found number two purpose organize employees belong union said matter fact induce plaintiffs employees organize affiliate unions it found purpose however felt bound wisconsin statutory scheme prohibiting picketing unless picketing pursuant dispute majority employees employer so found picketing unlawful statute ive alluded entered temporary injunction restraining picketing the parties upon stipulated record contained facts would adduced court merits and stipulation court entered permanent injunction making findings facts conclusions law from point unions took appeal wisconsin supreme court holding wisconsin supreme court initially pertinent proceedings leave court i would like quote one flat unequivocal finding wisconsin court first decision the court said “the testimony would supported finding facts constituting violation either subsections” 11106 2a restrains unions coercing employees right join join union 11106 2b restrains employers exercise right join join union the final rehearing violation b involved case now wisconsin court said threats made plaintiff no demands made upon it appear  appear defendants representatives even spoken plaintiff law officers desire organize employees there violence force threat force disorder physical destruction plaintiffs property there evidence defendants representatives coerced intimidated plaintiffs employees right join refuse join either defendant unions there peaceful persuasion exercised carrying banner bearing truthful legend it yes case would different posture say  on  it could found coercion accomplish unlawful purpose violation wisconsin statue when say “coercion” course youre speaking term many meanings   may coercive it may compulsive it may inducing there many adjectives might describe effect picketing may but say illegally coercive compel commission unlawful act entirely different thing that finding trial court refused make that finding wisconsin supreme court refused make first decision that finding wisconsin supreme court made second decision well raises course questions present   fact no wisconsin court expressively rejected idea union coercing employees recognition union claiming recognize it expressively rejected finding picketing activities coercive employees then i misapprehended question even though union may time represent majority even though union may time represent majority well union represents majority raises questions i believe picketing would protected instance but raises question present although court found kind purpose say record would support finding we never made claim represent   majority employees the picketing purpose protecting union standards it hoped ultimately might persuade employees join union it hoped period time might divert patronage   course unions place yes well wisconsin court find coercion get union recognition using influence employer regard in words either employer say union “i recognize you” employer say employees “you must join union ill discharge you” thereby putting union position representing employees now thats wisconsin court said and according statutory policy says employee right refuse join union says employer must interfere exercise right says union shall picket employer compel employer interfere exercise right thats decided case well i think one  in one sense youre talking coercing violation state law in sense  thats state law your honor no i think question raised whether facts  thats right thats right attacking validity injunction purportedly based upon statue deprives us constitutional rights well depends upon inferences court drew undisputed facts primary constitutional right involved well  its precisely position your honor the wisconsin court reject idea picketing could restrained statute said pursuance dispute majority employer in fact another case decided day declared statute unconstitutional refused apply principle case authority swing wohl cases on rehearing however without  without facts without evidence without referring acts court concluded error making initial finding record would support finding unlawful purpose it said given insufficient consideration rights might involved situation it said right draw inferences undisputed facts say court right it concluded union hoped picketing would interfere business employer thus bring pressure upon employer coerce employees join union it concluded message banner could enlightenment employees employees already solicited aware fact union wanted join it concluded since picketing country road business patronized small number customers when i say thats inference court drew record this picketing could guidance  could guidance community so rejected possible bases picketing came ultimate conclusion purpose influence deliverymen would compel employer inconvenience damage sustained either continue  permit continuance picketing loss possibly loss business means coerce employees violation wisconsin statute join union violation section 11106 2b therefore court vacated original mandate reinstated initial judgment the unions permanently restrained engaging picketing premises nonunion employees employed business located well october case reargued your honor the decision court announced february following year period somesix seven months shifting position took place thats right same court change personnel counsel case thats right the picketing cases court extensively reviewed brief filed amicus curiae we dont intend examine analyze cases detail they may summarized generally briefly holding number one picketing working mans means communication it form free speech number two aspects plus considerations may little bit free speech therefore subject regulation state limited aspects those limited aspects decisions court picketing enmeshed violence background violence could restrained picketing place economic connection area dispute could restrained picketing compel violation valid state policy could restrained this court make clear however picketing  could restrained merely based upon states notion labor dispute trying establish artificial bounds labor dispute actually case involves series cases court held picketing compel violation valid state policy may regulated restrained state regardless whether state policy announced judiciary legislative branch state well im sorry thats right thats right thats true i  thats right no yes no mr justice frankfurter youre right what i seeking inept way emphasize fact that issue detoured issue appeals made respondents respect policies might applied strength labor union growth labor union change economic circumstances that issue and say considering record court bound conclusions wisconsin supreme court respect purpose picketing based upon undisputed facts record we say that finding fact it conclusion law it mixed finding fact law court traditionally asserted right draw conclusions whereas facts undisputed we say even may considered finding fact distinguished conclusion inference law still subject independent review evaluation involves claim first rank thats rights first amendment that decided say court civil liberties cases involving coerced confessions discrimination empanelling juries decided court picketing cases previously court i refer thornhill meadowmoor graham court said we think theres one consideration court must give determining whether inference conclusion drawn wisconsin valid one believe presumption would ordinarily prevail favor state action operate substantial claim made first amendment rights we say normal presumption must yield presence considerations comity state federal government the freedom expression decisions court rule the restraint exception doubt say decisions court must resolved favor fundamental right where least  i think settled i think theres   i think theres question language used describing situation i appreciate justices feel preferred position i appreciate justices feel momentum respect i think quote justice frankfurters language i think event agreed entitled great weight  sufficient weight overcome presumption constitutionality i think figure agreement presumption unconstitutionality examining statute now assert presumption unconstitutionality action taken state judiciary i think little bit right well say  well certainly decisions  well right well say decisions court matter test court may applied court made fairly clear seems heavy burden upon would justify restraint prove basis restraint need clear unequivocal convincing proof well i think im coming court adopted test well i  im quoting i believe  well i dont   suppose going get argument semantics  well right at least court agreed also required solidity evidence in words youre dealing rights whether say go slow whether say burden shifted whether say presumption shifted must something record various kind inference based upon speculation remote possibilities certainly  yes say state facts heres quote made  made completely opposite judgment   identical  i think frequently happens concerning questions law concerning conclusions drawn undisputed facts your honor that effect statute yes and dont quarrel policy we thats true well record fails show  evidence purpose compel employer violate rights employees not join labor union thats right we say employee right join we say employer may coerce right join we say union may coerce employer coerce employee right join and say one single fact record reasonable inference may drawn finding may made picketing facts circumstances purpose coercing employer interfere rights employees yes yes thats point the evidence a solicitation nonunion employees representatives labor union discussion advantages organization followed peaceful picketing truthful banner site nonunion employees working unaccompanied threats violence intimidation unaccompanied demand made upon employer enter contract union interfere rights employees join join union no demand there never demand made upon employer never discussion employer respect matter the union confined solicitation employees picketing employees refused solicitation picketing near place dispute place employment displaying standard  on public highway county trunk p adjoining place employment thats they marched entrance private road leading gravel pit private road led public highway no theres suggestion case theres law knowledge would make unlawful they placard not per se the placard said employees establishment 100 affiliated afof l thats sign ever said never connection employer never approach employer never discussion well argument runs something like read opinion you couldnt picketing  persuade employees join union already solicited solicitation unsuccessful you couldnt picketing inform public many people travel road therefore think picketing signal anybody wanted make delivery might sympathetic cause would go picket sign no the statute   forbid well lets follow  all right  this  chain reasoning if picketing signal deliverymen must picketing hurt employer if picketing hurt employer must compel employer one two things either tolerate picketing violate law get therefore chain reasoning logic go back initial picketing find accomplish unlawful purpose compelling employer violate state statute we  that would violation that would violation your honor thats right no there  well yes there discussion respect advantages unionism discussion   took place employees union representative none whatsoever yes no never demand   employer your honor never discussion employer yes surely thats true that  well industrial objective protect standards in protection standards joining union would one way certainly well  surely thats right made upon employer thats right thats right its  simple now i say chain reasoning  yes well would net result actually  well  i think  excuse it would still violate first fourteenth amendments well  thats right yes position mr justice black challenging second kind statute  say might result we challenging application valid statute we dont want  case  except  yes well would rather put way your honor we would rather say net result decision completely set vitality holding court labor dispute even though employees employment employer actually said  yes well done much subtle fashion your honor well net result well think we think we appreciate court felt otherwise we believe actually public advertising whether   whether   press yes otherwise your honor well court indicated  no no court held less lawful circumstance this court held circumstances usual attributes usual protections given speech evidenced newspapers film pamphlet extend completely protection would afforded speech evidenced picketing thats court done yes yes youve restrained  well  well i know court done respect mass picketing respect picketing unlawful purpose respect picketing enmeshed violence respect picketing outside industrial dispute yes thats right and distinction i said court drawn well distinction ive also said i agree   nevertheless were confronted yes but i say confronted situation seek reverse holding quarrel way say applied sure im sorry it conclusion wisconsin supreme court second opinion that hope intent union that conclusion drawn undisputed facts wisconsin supreme court   picketing signal purpose what  well finding fact i say kind conclusion reviewable its inference say could drawn matter well right but  position certainly signal known communication form well assume one objects one things least union foresaw would act signal would flow that person employer case might violate law consequence agreed exercise constitutional right reason backward subjective reaction employer consequential damage say action therefore beginning unlawful well  no no well hypothesis i dont case assumed proven proven you assumed statement number one intended solely signal number two signal responded number three knew would responded number four knew responded would hurt employer number five knew would hurt employer would violate law therefore intended hurt employer violate law therefore go back signal say longer constitutionality protected now kind priori reasoning nonsectarian reasoning upside backward reasoning motivated court opinion case to say picketing  we may may i dont know thats test whether effectiveness test it may particular community state organization high even newspaper ad might induce great many union people go store make deliveries store gravel pit it may small community like waukesha county neither picketing advertising radio movies would persuade anybody continue business employer continue go employers place business but i say right picket constitutional right please depend upon slender rights going look effectiveness going look subjective results reason backwards point determine whether first instance unlawfully purposed placed picket malicious intended deliberately run somebody business way compel alternative violate law and wisconsin us they made conclusion record opinion completely excepted completely lacking justification kind conclusion would made difference case evidence record union gone employer picketing politely without coercion without threat picketing said “wed like shop organized” yes yes would  that would made difference it would make difference under decisions court particularly gazzam case would position ever  asked employer put employees union sign contract us time legally inhibited nevertheless refused picketed entirely different picture it picture that picture  now see   already court to test absence element say deprives finder fact say that  infer went well i dont know talking absence elements there  supposing engaged solicitation whatsoever merely coldly put picket particular place there might great deal basis drawing inference trying put heat employer weve made glorified effort interest people organization supposing drop hint place line one employers competitors were going make employer sign contract picketed nothing like record precisely point your honor well wanted influence somebody surely we trying persuade nonunion people join union we trying advice friends sympathizers people union destroying standard fought maintain and  well mr justice frankfurter right persuade employer i dont believe court draw inference trying make employer commit unlawful act no i think entitled assumption intend anybody violate law and i dont think inference drawn absence evidence support inference well reason your honor agree fought least litigated problem unlawful purpose reason now happened that court announced unlawful purpose doctrine courts formally pay least lip service early decisions court stirring around records find unlawful purpose now without intending disrespect wisconsin court say thats exactly rehearing case it find record first said couldnt possibly finding surely  what happened shear speculation i dont know happened well i think view fact i exhausted time might something i want say remaining five minutes i sit thank well i dont mine id glad send i could mailed today im addressing question asked mr chief justice warren there allegation proof respect number people travels county highway country road respect number customers might it first arose courts decision motion rehearing footnote brief point evidence support i think case thoroughly canvassedi want point alternatives employer position many employers survive picketing well many employers fact increase business patronage reason sympathetic unions cause if particular employer might increase truck fleet get deliveries money may saving employees members union drawing union wage and finally although never believed employer anything strictly neutral matters court law indicated beyond possibility employer sit employees discuss fully frankly advantages disadvantages organization either make promise benefit exchange whatever action may take threaten reprisal exchange whatever action takesso confined case might indicate solely question either got yield go business and i say fact employer might inclined violate law applying subjective test its applying test effectiveness picket line used determining whether right constitutional rank unlawfully purposed thank you,1047.0,1532,78,number 79 international brotherhood teamsters versus vogt incorporated mr previant in number many would  would interfere course intended argument stated difference 11  11106 2b 2a well found violate b i mean final rehearing suppose trial court found coercion find did find suppose found coercion would im saying facts  facts   couldnt found coercion thats i bring question so wisconsin said picketing order coerce recognition union unlawful would unconstitutional im sure theyre im sure theyre im talking employees what im  the action says picketing coerce employer recognize union shall hereafter barred would unlawful pardon yes what picketing  what picketing well  suppose court  im asking questions troublesome questions in mind opinion court troublesome mind suppose wisconsin court found effort found coercion get union recognition wisconsin law barred would unconstitutional but  i dont follow constitutional bring pressure bare state would call coercion get union recognition would violative constitution i dont follow i cannot   connect coercion well state law shouldnt means picketing obtain object thats state law yes well unconstitutional is so isnt  youre  youre attacking validity statute whether facts bring within that depends construction state court made specific facts allowable area differences judgment well due respect mr previant i dont get far starting violation  finding violation constitutional right if thats course thats end matter what im troubled exactly youre asking us namely i understand youre asking us say warrant undisputed facts  warrant undisputed facts  part supreme court wisconsin draw inference thats draw inference effect compel use means picketing means gaining recognition union that disallowable inference court right am i right finding shifting position supreme court took place june 28th october 5th yes in court that cuts ways well im  im surprised im puzzled tricky   tricky problems fault but problem isnt  i understood colloquy recognize state may make state policy bring called coercive influence picketing bear bring particular result is right but  i understood indicate issue us basis record warrant conclusion   bringing within policy so dont argue whether allowable policy the question wasnt baseless therefore arbitrary finding come within policy am i wrong all right isnt settled document court mr previant well thats  what youre saying  youre saying anymore youre contending anymore deal freedom speech go slow a little bit all right lets   i dont think  see i put burden difference  or simply warrant caveat notion principle law presumptively things deal freedom speech justified go you know put way come result want come i dont mean i mean anyone puts way comes result all right yes i know things could quote know inaudible it isnt semantics but judgment   different judges set facts also something record this court done and maybe later judgment wiser judgment means much respected may i ask question get clear you say thing consider whether right draw inference statute violated number 11106 2b you  agree statute valid saying picketing coerce intimidate induce employer interfere employees enjoyment legal right you dont quarrel and say quarrel found statute violated inadequate inferences  inadequate evidence support inferences in short say do say theres evidence show coerced theres evidence show intimidated evidence show purpose induce theres failure show purpose interfere employees enjoyment legal rights which one now isnt shown what fail show you mean purpose compel employee  coercion intimidation inducement interfere employees right and thats whole basis argument now would bother maybe said enough satisfaction enough mine yet state summary evidence tell us effects  that point isnt what demand does show well  anything enjoined marching around what  enjoined thats  was highway street  and marched backwards forward   running around is law wisconsin held law march backwards forwards highway what say whole evidence marched backwards forwards they placards is law wisconsin claimed law wisconsin march backwards forwards placards what placards say yes placards say was ever is evidence agreement ever said anything else employer except said  employer except said placard did court point way coerced intimidated induced argument what  included  statute forbid well   reference particular thing by seeing   intimidating employer get i dont know  which would compel join union didnt belong wanted belong inaudible as i understand say demand specific wages hours conditions employment so  this concerned merely abstractly stating i dont mean carry implication concerned merely absence affiliation employees plant enterprise belonged union is right but i mean couldnt anybody  there specific demand employer except relation  i mean use neutral phrase except relation unionization is right no i dont  no far picketing   justice black developed picketing must purpose it wasnt   charivari it wasnt mardi gras it industrial objective didnt and industrial objective get join union is right well  aim protect standards union thats i know   one reasons unions one appropriate necessary point view right   demand specific changes conditions employment employer and mode communicating whomsoever communicated employees enterprise didnt belong union and saying effect isnt construed state statute facts case forbidding members union advertise fact want people working join union and thats  saying statute written language way applied it would violate one in words   hadnt   put statute shall unlawful law state wisconsin men invite people join union publicize fact would statute violate thats claim  your claim i understand said evidence shows therefore theyve applied statute way makes unlawful men invite others join union privately publicly i understand but court   court construes meaning would bound states construction meaning statute what youre saying understanding that statute applied meaning interpret authorize   forbids   forbids people  members unions invite others join publicly why want get around labor dispute saying forbidden maybe youre right wrong   facts  limit saying unlawful wisconsin union men invite others join union publicly whatever way theyve done youre claiming theyve done well “public” dont mean  thing putting ad paper whole article written friendly people by “public” mean way  public way what im  im  im questioning public aspect this public ad  milwaukee journal public well court held otherwise case that left right lawful march backwards forwards person could less lawful invite somebody join union circumstances well course members court drawn difference marching backwards forwards element picketing publicity and say aside one thing found say supported perfectly lawful march front bills well i supposed members court agreed isnt enough say  marching abstract proposition doesnt settle cases that may march numbers circumstances placards may say things might say newspaper would difference i supposed said decision unanimous point i dont think ive ever said weve  he doesnt know well weve  weve outlawed mass picketing havent mr previant well  so already claim marching constitutionally protected circumstances what think what think you wouldnt saying mass picketing first amendment would well im suggesting   unlawfulness may derived conditions reference picketing would unlawful context newspaper all right thats distinction i said “i havent drawn” well thats  thats  i suppose one says court drawn one means court you made clear i think made i may say mr previant narrow circumscribed position urging well mr previant may i ask one question did make reference perhaps i put way finding picketing purposed shutoff deliveries employer was finding picketing purposed part least shutoff deliveries employer operators vehicles members picketing union would cross picketing line well  i dont follow mean conclusion is say finding something else well lets  lets suppose could drawn then would position well  i gather  i understood mean conclusion signal whatever word way pressure exerted upon employer i think said earlier would unlawful pressure induce employees join union normal operations business could resume no i want get  i want get fact picketing part purposed shutoff deliveries employer affect conduct business would effort relieve put pressure employees join union would case now hypothesis   would   case

authority demonstrating work interpreter 28 usc section 19206 limited spoken communication primary among court interpreters act whose central provisions afford simultaneous consecutive spoken interpreter services when well justice sotomayor i think  textual ambiguity statute extent covered spoken interpreter services one could argue either way dont  i happy proceed either assumption but clear however far extends within area spoken interpretation document translation courtappointed experts your honor i think legislative history seems indicate that provision actually inserted 19206 separate housekeeping reason parallels rule 706 federal rules evidence preexisting rule addressing courtappointed experts simply put enumeration yes your honor i  i think  that may well case but i  i think of course well well your honor i think your honor i think primary reason court  adopt  inconsistent text yes your honor and  also worth noting courts  none courts appeals adopted construction 19206 considered addressed primary arguments case they havent addressed uniform professional literature addressing  topic dictionaries aggregate administrative offices interpretation statute consistent congressional distinction written translation spoken  spoken interpretation runs throughout code well your honor im  im  im sure i  good answer i  perhaps werent presented  arguments didnt opportunity consider i think  i think your honor  kan pacific disputes little  central argument their discussion well your honor i think   best reason reject view doesnt make coherent whole statute these provisions operate together uniform set  uniform set policies addressing common subject and way  provisions interact broad strokes makes perfect sense reading  primary class cases motivated passage statute namely cases brought government significant constitutional confrontation clause concerns criminal defendants understanding spoken proceedings core class cases congress elected pay spoken interpreter services directly first instance now noncore class cases litigation private civil litigation congress elected pay services 19206 facilitate lesser manner providing party incurred expenses could recover end case well justice breyer actually specific provision bill prior version bill addressed context puerto rico and significance provision congress addressing written translation part  part provision specifically used word translation refer and confirms usual congressional practice differentiating terms  statutes generally fully applicable congress knew difference terms used appropriately fact removed  provision statute statute passed contains words interpreter interpretation forms translate reaffirms  ordinary meaning terms apply your honor professional literature addresses sight interpretation sight translation uniformly recognized species interpretation it occurs   interpreter speaks aloud presence audience communicated course spoken proceeding well your honor i think preparatory work occurred outside court would compensable interpretation work but  interpreter returned court gave oral interpretation document would constitute interpretation thats true mr chief justice but key reason would constitute interpretation  interpreter speaking aloud communicating course spoken conversation audience  doesnt speak english perhaps i your honor i apologize well your honor i think literature typically class incourt oral communication content form interpretation but ambiguity point really  really doesnt  doesnt affect anything practice i mean sight interpretation occurs brief interval larger proceeding if i understand your honor correctly yes i think ordinary meaning translate applies context  communication information written documents and  discrete interpretation  limited im sorry i apologize your honor yes use word translate generically theres question frequently court i think court well people use word translate manner doesnt differentiate modes our point  double meaning doesnt apply interpreter single narrow meaning limited spoken communication and kan pacifics discussion dictionaries limited single dictionary websters third the majority dictionaries categorically exclude document translation scope it your honor well court  mci v att case indicate but  event  terms definition supports reading kan pacifics indicate even dictionary definition common meaning term meaning referring spoken communications and court frequently looks common meaning purposes statutory interpretation mallard construing word request ramsey construing word envelope i talk  theres  text the  text im  im sorry im sure theres explicit statement im aware legislative history theres lot provisions legislative history plainly presuppose and congress received professional literature  documents american association language specialists specifically respect costs congress  house report alludes rule 43f 43d relevant preexisting rule and course undisputed rule 43ds cost provision  limited spoken communication interpreters so history well but  i think theres doubt text statute subsection k modes subsection appears page 5a red brief appendix initially passed expressly says interpretation  section must done using methods agree limited spoken communication now not your honor no your honor that would constitute interpreting would  interpreter would communicating live parties context realtime proceeding well that  thats correct your honor yes your honor courtroom context live spoken proceeding satisfies ordinary definitional elements interpreting but thats case somebodys office presence single party written document and  theres question your honor extent theres ambiguity respect unusual examples distinction thats absolutely clear vast majority real world incidents well i think  one could potentially argue spoken interpretation deposition isnt covered light dictionaries like blacks law dictionary indicates word restricted people work trial but i certainly think could argued either way case im sure definitive  i think could argue either way your honor it doesnt affect case i think theres reasonable reading that covered i think thats certainly  vested interest opposing well your honor sort discretion demonstrably prevent issuance large awards number large awards issued notwithstanding discretion well necessarily your honor the  district courts thats way works your honor but i dont think that discretion sufficient eliminate deterrent effect court recognized cases like farmer fleischmann occurs end case litigant already decided whether bring suit the deterrent effect occurs ex ante riskaverse litigant decide whether bring case but i  i would note sorts policy questions your honor arise context language terms extends interpreting translating and would say relevant policy question simply whether sensible reasons  congress may drawn line and plainly adequate reasons services document translation services excluded potentially large fall general principles court recognized  presumptively frequently avoided certainly your honor as difference i mean im aware  statute interpreters spoken interpretation award approaching anywhere near larger document translation awards issued but nonetheless i denying could large interpreter awards cases but fact adding document translation awards additive the sort necessity review would necessary police document translation awards would quite burdensome district courts and fact necessity standard actually particularly problematic apply translations your honor because fact dont know document says translated and exercise trying go back reconstruct ex ante  whether person reasonably necessary causing translated something didnt know meant likely lead subjective your honor i suggesting tremendous financial strain system we saying statute plain language extends im sorry your honor i actually i didnt hear end question im sure great bulk i mean theres significant disagreement well i think  i think increased time im sure i could pinpoint date your honor your honor im sure i find adversary arguing first decision certainly wasnt construing 19206 time your honor your honor certainly your honor um addressing 1978 your honor absolutely correct your honor we agree and structural reasons  within court interpreters act every bit powerful ordinary textual indicia support reading and fact kan pacifics argument word interpreters assigned different meanings different parts statute  unsupported kan pacific relies characterizes different language section 2 put 1827 1828 section 7 put cost provision and notes section 2 sometimes uses broader phrase interpreters courts united states  whereas section 7 uses word interpreters alone but kan pacific doesnt examine context section 2 does use broader phrase and specifics really undermine argument one might make along lines as originally passed section 2 1827 contains 26 occurrences word interpreter counting title and 26 cases 24 simply use word interpreter so certainly threshold overarching pattern usage distinction more fundamentally though substantive provisions addressing use interpreters parties cases 1827 without using broader phrase subsection im sorry your honor without using broader phrase courts united states  subsection provision  governs use interpreters cases brought government this appears page 2a red brief appendix simply provides upon determination need services interpreter used cases the two provisions use phrase interpreters courts united states  subsections b 1a red brief appendix provisions  addressing scope administrative offices duties statute and simply makes clear keeping offices ordinary function  facilitating work federal courts making clear offices  instance certifying interpreters state courts so nothing language suggests way  word interpreter means something different different places services interpreter viewed embracing thing so think variety indicia meaning converge case support conclusion 19206 limited spoken communication if questions i reserve balance r himmelfarb very briefly your honor three points in first place justice breyer i wanted let know first decision  first appellate decision construing 19206 encompass document translation dc circuits decision lam quy 1981 second mr himmelfarb noted blacks law dictionary takes definition arguably could encompass document translation didnt mention operative version blacks 1978 statute passed  different definition excluded document translation and change definition occurred 1999 seventh edition number judicial decisions construing 19206 come supports your honors observation could well merely reflect recognition decisions rather independent support finally your honors mr himmelfarb cited certain notices issued administrative office many years ago these brief notices ministerial documents simply announced forthcoming examination the office issued guidance judiciary policy  fully expressed views issue and posted offices website its current june 9 2011  expressly provides document translation part statutory services interpreter if questions id happy address them,642.0,872,33,we hear argument next case 101472 kouichi taniguchi v kan pacific saipan limited mr fried can i make sure i understand extent argument are saying interpretation oral interpretation courtroom i  i say read way suggesting appointed experts get recompensed time theyre testifying thats time spend court yes but court experts get  get paid prep work could i  one question i take arguments i read common dictionary question primary meaning interpreter interpretation oral languages but dictionary broad enough include translation work well given courts 70 years awarding  except i think seventh virtually every court 70year period awarding translation fees  authorized shouldnt enough us meaning dictionary term broad enough thats courts world hasnt crashed despite one case large amount given  adversary points fact translation fees tend fairly reasonable  muck works i think i drawing  i drawing ways colleague next usually asks question laughter its wrong answer right just curiosity think courts took granted opposite reading perhaps dr johnsons answer lady pointed error dictionary answer stupidity madam sheer stupidity  laughter there  lots regions country puerto rico example vast numbers documents translated go federal court necessarily commonwealth court thats expensive people and might thought long time expense wont go away least better paid loser paid winner so thats common practice i dont think thats foolish approach and find language go back  go back justice sotomayor what think  i mean first circuit dealt deals lot puerto rico felt fell within idea fees exemplification certifying document and fact certify document comes federal court san juan translated often and translation cost least consistent idea trying  may  dont  may impose cost loser what document  thats read open court document contract another language interpreter  witness presents document interpreter interprets but  interpreter diligent said im going to translate document open court i would like advance i sure translation going accurate fact interpreter looks document in preparation trial translates but  shes interpreting shes already got thing whatever language english i guess but i mean shes interpreting shes reading english translation oh i misunderstood hypothetical im sorry i thought situation got   document  say french person translates interprets  i dont want prejudge issue   english person reads english thing  court thats interpretation point well true matter common usage talking oral testimony court often use interpretation translation interpreter translator somewhat interchangeably talking rendering document  different language generally talk translation this matter common usage do think thats correct well didnt understand question that wasnt quite point my point i think say  fact supreme court case said hernandez case talking oral testimony court tend use translator translate interpreter interpret somewhat interchangeably is correct websters third i recall dictionary defines imply mean infer infer mean imply its good dictionary laughter could get back issue in legislative history provision indication congress explicitly rejected translation work coverage outside text is statement one sponsors congressional bill those provisions passed respect so lawyer sits interpreter office says interpreter i cant pay translation work  now sit interpret letter says  is asking lawyers accept reading but would say might different courtroom because lawyer communicating something live it could courtroom outside is something logical what depositions the translation would spoken word wouldnt court well whats  whats position i  i take deposition law office i interpreter is recoverable well think affects way read statute what think result let ask question in background concern going minor cases huge translation costs would simply unfair and answer yes isnt taken care statutory direction court may give costs well isnt abuse discretion well i mean words court sees  cost preparing documents english language quite substantial light whats involved case fair award cant court discretion deny way works i guess im  im problem theyre potentially large interpretive services potentially large although claim dont  sort terminus point ive trials weve multiple languages simultaneously translated multiple defendants witnesses speaking even languages i southern district new york and fees without translation oral courtroom work sometimes went ahead months so potentialitys question if youre talking disproportionality goes word reasonable statute doesnt i mean ortho case point court sizably cut translation fees and importantly little i tell huge patent case patent claimed control 60 percent market so i dont know that small case anyones definition well i havent  i interested amici side consists professors i guess trade associations interpreters translators people would financial stake defense bar plaintiffs bar certain circumstances filed brief and i tend though putting lot weight take sign along long period time hasnt tremendous financial problem what evidence there i see cases general the plain language argument i got but many years great bulk court going way how many years would say great bulk federal system deciding differently way think thats bulk well rot set in opinion how long when first one as far back 19  it district court but far back 1930s some 40s 50s no clearly but awards common you case cited 1812 i take thats i thought  i thought addressing whether good idea give fees whether fees payable particular statute right which enacted 1978 thats long ago do without thank counsel the case submitted,1292.0,1718,13,thank mr chief justice may please court the word interpreter two possible meanings relevant broader one narrower one the broader meaning person translates one language another under definition terms interpreter translator used interchangeably it used narrower sense context i think justice scalia the narrower meaning interpreter member profession specializes oral translation narrower sense interpreter distinct translator sense youve identified person specializes written translation our submission great majority courts expressed view question recognized broader definition makes sense particular context issue and say number reasons the first basic purpose translation litigation context make evidence intelligible parties court section 1920 reflects congressional judgment cost making evidence intelligible parties court borne losing party well well let clear i possibly im obviously standing saying lose language would good idea statute cover written translation thats legitimate enterprise court interpreting statute what im saying text statute bears two  permissibly bears two possible meanings that case legitimate enterprise court say makes sense likely congress would intended particular context well let  let address first part question first essentially i understand isnt background principle says costs dont get taxed i actually think insofar far tax  costs concerned distinct attorneys fees background principle actually goes way i think ordinarily true i dont think follows follows way sort tiebreaking interpretive canon says interpreting costs statute version effect since middle 19th century unsure scope err side narrowness rather breadth i dont think interpretive principle no dont well i think obviously start case statutory case submission two possible ordinary definitions you two possible common usages i mean i guess i dispute we websters know justice scalias view notwithstanding viewed many people authoritative dictionary english language we got blacks law dictionary i think everyone agrees leading law dictionary provides definition interpreter broad definition advocate to sure thats true thats absolutely true dictionary law dictionary take cases account i think ordinarily presumed congress taking account cases taking account dictionary definitions well i  im sure thats true i think large litigations many many days trial potentially pretrial proceedings could large oral translation costs where many depositions could large oral translation costs but even i accept premise question seems way costs get controlled exercise district courts discretion tax every  cost translating every document the fifth circuit one well typically criteria  i add criteria taxing costs every sort interpreter costs document translation costs essentially thought necessity reasonableness so connection document translation costs fifth circuit suggested way tax appropriate way tax might tax cost translating headings foreign language documents sufficient let lawyer know whether relevant document might bear translation documents really turned based translation heading significance case so thats one example way discretion gets exercised that  thats true for  the necessity limitation subsection 6 subsections dont specifically use word 54 federal rules civil procedure essentially make discretionary call district courts necessity long recognized one components discretionary determination the reason say doesnt make sense narrower definition interpreter one congress enacted written document translation often every bit important oral translation in many cases could important contract case example well i mean i suppose goes without saying would rather win subsection 4 lose subsection 6 there thats true absolutely true there courts suggested document translation fits subsection 4 i think done tended  tended section 6 added 1978 we havent i think accurate before 1978 courts taxed document translation costs i believe also relied inherent authority time thought permissible ground taxing costs absolutely there  frankly nothing legislative history court interpreters act really bears issue one way another there lot legislative history petitioner relies addressed section 2 separate provision deals separate subject appointment interpreters cases initiated united states no thats right we dont  i guess i go back i started think dictionary definitions common usage two permissible meanings interpreter i dont  i  i think i would dispute i dont know whether one common meaningful way it may slightly common use narrower sense refer member profession certainly common enough district judges country written opinion sort matteroffactly talking people translate documents interpreters im aware there arent   i frankly dont think many places united states code term interpreter used sort obvious narrowest sense based context statute so example number statutes talk funding translators interpreters citizens united states it seems us context congress getting interpreter translator narrower sense members profession justice kagan i would say every provision united states code interpreter  word interpreter used either clear whether includes document translation context strongly indicates limited oral translation and neither situations obtains view i aware provision united states code there  none clear covers document translation there  state statutes cited use term interpreter  clearly cover document translation cite brief i would surprised 50 percent hits used narrower sense however i couldnt venture guess i would rather bet laughter i want say something concept sight translation something friend mr fried averted sight translation hybrid endeavor it oral translation written documents one reasons think broader meaning interpreter makes sense section 1920 cant really account sensible way sight translation in case example counsel  kan pacifics counsel took taniguchis deposition and prepare deposition reviewed  review contracts written japanese medical records written japanese now view documents translated writing prepare deposition would result potentially taxable cost under taniguchis view wouldnt but sounds like either partys view instead handing documents document translator translated writing sat law office member interpreter profession said heres box documents please tell say that would potentially taxable cost that seems to odd result one thats well i dont know would increase costs it may cheaper use oral translator   oral translator opposed written document translator and might variety reasons would choose use one another time constraints importance particular document but i dont think likely congress would thought potential taxability translation well i think every court thats ever thought found deposition  oral translation deposition well theres  i dont see basis statute frankly practice translators interpreters drawing line particular place and far question taniguchi would court  court draw concern i think hard question answer moved back forth many times his briefs offer several different  several different narrower definitions interpreter sometimes saying oral translation oral speech sometimes saying oral translation language whether oral written sometimes saying limited incourt interpretation sometimes saying that seems us good reason adopting broader interpretation it seems unlikely congress would want courts get extremely complicated frankly unprincipled line drawing exercises i think  i think line drawing sometimes necessary exercise text statute compels our submission text statute doesnt compel readily available alternative interpretation doesnt require sorts line drawings and far whether sort  outlying  examples i give outlying oddball circumstances goes i dont think sight translation example core function interpreters translators alike and i guess point i would say  make sight translation friend mr fried suggested that  something could covered takes place course live proceedings i think yet another narrowing word interpreter but far i aware sight translation little sight translation actually occurs well i think  i mean i think important point and goes question know whether difficult district courts make determination whether particular document translation taxed one arguments side i think history strong evidence difficult courts certainly since 1978 provision added even and havent evident difficulty deciding whether tax documents document translation much so i think  history certainly bears case respect a word i cant think case top head i think true case little bit different insofar courts taxing document translation costs 1978 relying something word interpreter so may stretch say congress chose use word interpreter necessarily incorporating courts previously done but i dont think entirely irrelevant done long time i think unfair presume congress would aware the court interpreters act two main provisions relevant theres section 2 really  main provision  section 7 became 19206 title 28 provision issue an important part taniguchis submission section 2 limited oral translators therefore follow section 7 provision issue likewise limited oral translators and main submission  question congress actually used different language section 2 section 7 section 2 added two provisions title 28 section 1827 section 1828 titled address respectively interpreters courts united states special interpretation services in section 7 added subsection 6 1920 congress use two phrases instead uses phrase interpreters simply interpreters courts united states  special interpretation services so extent appropriate canon use similar different language different provisions statute seems us appropriate canon one presume congress uses different language intends different meanings i want respond mr frieds point number times word 2 and i understand point  much frequently used  words courts united states  what statute actually add  say adding section 1827 calls it subsection says administrative office united states court establish program facilitate use interpreters courts united states  im sorry red brief 1a appendix beginning court interpreters act and theres subsection c flipping next page  im sorry subsection b  says director certify interpreters courts united states  so beginning statute establish thing called certified interpreter courts united states when thereafter speaks interpreter simply thats shorthand certified interpreter courts united states so seems us far court interpreters act concerned even true section 2 uses term narrower sense doesnt necessarily follow used narrower sense section 7 and point i would add set  point brief really clear section 2 limited oral translators soon court interpreters act enacted approximately 16 years thereafter administrative office would publish notices federal register notifying public  going certification exams interpreters section 2 court interpreters act these pretty streamlined notices long and one main aspects main sections notice list director administrative office said  duties interpreters courts united states and sure listed simultaneous consecutive interpreting  listed sight translation listed document translation so minimum section 2 sufficiently clearly limited oral translators director administrative office couldnt issue notices saying otherwise i guess  last point i want make statutes use term interpreter translator together i already addressed part saying many statutes really pretty clearly used narrower sense youre talking members profession the  thing i would say premise taniguchis reliance statutes seems would strangely redundant congress speak statutes interpreters translators together fact two terms could used interchangeably redundancy avoided but subsection 6 1920 redundancy it covers interpreters special interpretation services and i dont think anybody could dispute anyone carries special interpretation service interpreter so odd redundancy congress addressing subject translation,585.0,820,30,have ever seen book know translated foreign language know war peace know mercy call translator says fly page know john smith comma trans period does ever say john smith comma int period no doesnt it reflects judgment right interpreter means translator i mean begging question you could say one embrace but whether congress thought mostly dependent language congress used isnt why interpretation make sense shouldnt view backdrop american rule fees party generally bears costs specific circumstances loser pay now taxation costs narrow concept what difference case lot documents rendered one language another prior court proceeding case mass scientific evidence interpreted scientist or financial evidence interpreted accountant in instances losing party doesnt pay winners expenses back costs get taxed costs narrow small part expenses party litigating case isnt  isnt true well arent asking interpretive principle errs side breadth rather narrowness why dont ask whats common whats best reading but dictionaries tell us one usage far common well i guess blacks law dictionary  editor  coauthor i  i feel obliged spring defense laughter since law dictionary presumably ought taken account cases referring many use word  sense right like garner one  one things concerns impact  cost allowance normal litigation incentives an interpreter court one thing when suddenly get situation costs could quite large particularly  disparate way necessarily shared sides somebody goes court know going to  lose pay interpreter side comes says well think need submit 10000 pages  documents translated way lose going pay in words much variable element costs interpreter so  goes exercise discretion mr himmelfarb section 1920 two provisions specify costs necessarily obtained use case and interpreter provision doesnt qualification doesnt say necessarily obtained use case you asking read interpreter means mean translator well import sub 6 necessary use case  what think  i guess nobody wants defend argument including first circuit several others look provision permits taxing costs making specific exemplifications official documents costs making copies materials obtained use case now going make copy use case something japanese going to turn english so included part costs making copies materials documents use case now discretionary whether whether dont but thats several courts could read i wondering didnt strike obviously wrong maybe obviously i sure would like win subsection laughter all right so history prior 78 serious number  number circuits said get translation paid   necessary create copy usable court then congress passes knowing cases principle shift congress passes majority courts say right provision permits is accurate statement is anything history 78 statute suggested congress didnt want taxed so legislative history  theres  legislative history side either right saying  mean include so absent legislative history i guess rely words statute right that means dont look well two  may two permissible dont dispute fact natural common speak someone interpreting oral communication someone translating written correct well us code is place us code word interpreters clearly encompasses written translators so every case us code uses word interpreters means oral translators thats obvious way use word case supposed reach different conclusion let rephrase answer different way you  dont know situation us code translators  interpreter means translator and checked every one none right laughter somebody computer search database lets say newspaper articles magazine articles use term interpreter relationship foreign language and lets say look 1000 hits how many think would use term interpreter refer rendering written document one language another you like daring justice alito go laughter how much would bet laughter if bet enough i look 1000 i would surprised 2 percent its odd result nobodys going because point dont know going get saddled cost so wouldnt likely would something would increase costs would is  clear does anybody contend  side contend use viva voce translation outside court covered meaning interpreter i assume interpretation meant interpretation oral proceeding trial and  saying hold interpretation still include oral translations outside trial at deposition i consider part  part trial process  lawyers office asks somebody sit  read document i dont know mr himmelfarb why  different case draw line find result drawing line created close cases cases near line so know give obvious example fact minutes every 24hour period wheres hard say something night day mean night day and seems question here think hard cases they marginal cases i accept following history basically giving  want statute statute nobody thought going history statute capable translated natural thing and question take  go smaller capabilities leave well enough alone say gee hard translate  interpret statute way have got examples law i mean think example law i trying think history something the statute comes along makes little

erroneous refusal trial judge dismiss potential juror cause followed defendants exercise peremptory challenge remove juror the ninth circuit held case that sequence events requires automatic reversal conviction whenever defendant goes exhaust peremptory challenges jury selection we disagree result three alternative theories first use peremptory challenge exclude juror excused cause denial impairment peremptory challenge right proper purpose challenge used second assuming impairment peremptory challenge right case like one impairment warrant reversal otherwise fair trial jury actually empaneled sits impartial within meaning sixth amendment and third even case despite impartiality jury sits might error peremptory challenge process affects substantial rights effect found case like one defendant concededly untrammeled use 9 10 peremptory challenges never indicated record objected panel member actually empaneled seated jury the source peremptory challenge rights federal system rule 24 federal rules criminal procedure provides right peremptory challenge defense criminal cases increases number depending type case now rule 24 terms spell procedures trial courts use administer peremptory challenge process and court long made clear trial courts discretion formulate appropriate procedures thats right mr chief justice the  impairment conceivable record view would rule 24 right peremptory challenge the ninth circuit effect converted thought violation rule due process problem reasoning time defendant deprived rulebased right defendant also deprived procedural right protected constitution that theory court ever endorsed analysis variety rulebased statutory rights particularly context federal habeas corpus and certainly justice ginsburg i think rule  arguing today would apply equally even strongly civil context this court already made clear mcdonough v greenwood case errors voir dire process might impair intelligent exercise peremptory challenges rise level harmful error requiring reversal  civil judgment and principle court applied case cost society courts litigants high reverse conviction simply error jury selection process might infringed partys desire remove particular juror peremptory basis rather cause now error question jury selection actually results seating biased juror defendant adequately preserved challenge entirely different case case goes heart sixth amendment protects defendant well view would  would result error would require reversal conviction unless  juror would exercised peremptory fact biased juror sits jury if  sit jury position claim may preserved claim doesnt warrant relief costs society simply high reverse conviction simply defendant deprived  hypothetical your honor given one peremptory challenge there prejudice justice souter fact defendant forced virtue exhaustion peremptory challenges accept juror panel biased if court accepts primary harmless error theory cognizable harm defendant assert deprivation impartial jury thats correct now fallback well justice souter doesnt say litigants federal trial judges forget peremptories there rulebased right thats issue well variety different scenarios could come in federal system judge announced outset trial im aware judge done judge announced outset trial courtroom simply dont peremptory challenges i think theyre waste time inefficient i would assume defendant would able pursue extraordinary writ court appeals error corrected thats correct i would expect appellate court would write rather strong opinion would admonish trial judge others circuit flout rules procedure well i think defendant would different objection case would  judge essentially changed way peremptory challenges  administered settled rules common law therefore could tell judge that way peremptory challenges administered now question thats right this court this  court i think would position justice scalia important distinguish laughter well justice oconnor  fact scenario actually fact scenario case i would  would agree far serious intrusion upon defendants rights upon integrity judicial system biased juror actually sits panel there states determined administration peremptory challenge process gamesmanship whether biased juror sits doesnt sit our fallback harmless error position question case defendant claiming peremptory challenge rights infringed whether significant enough effect rights justify setting aside conviction i dont go far i dont want fall back farther i but let point laughter that principle could applied consistently cover cases essentially justice ginsburg ninth circuit government disagree case serious injury fairness trial the ninth circuits position regardless fair actual unfolding trial process whether defendant counsel performed effectively introduced evidence wanted introduce got opportunity cross examine governments witnesses impartial jury within sixth amendment  ninth circuits position despite impairment rulebased nonconstitutional peremptory challenge even single one requires tossing entire results trial starting our position simply that far high price pay case error affect fundamental fairness trial infringement peremptory challenges this court reserved category structural error error justifies setting aside results trial even though one cannot determine effect outcome serious deep constitutional injuries fundamental structure trial total denial counsel sitting biased judge denial proper reasonable doubt instruction kind error fundamentally infects trial unfairness unreliability our position denial infringement single peremptory challenge simply rise level that  thats correct justice ginsburg would falling back way members court suggested government needs go that casespecific result case defendant got end jury selection process judge said well i bunch jurors box im swear objection defendant said in case request additional peremptory challenge use juror even might opportunity court consider reversing conviction merely impairment peremptory challenges i dont think case well i think that substantial risk justice souter i also think true trial lawyers theyre selecting jury trying obtain either result wholly favors client  defendant seeking acquittal  least hung jury and  defense lawyer may willing take risk hell sort reversible error appeal well  fact way peremptories used mr chief justice laughter the  legitimate purposes ascribed historical sources going back blackstone peremptory challenge include buffer zone impartiality juror judges may make mistakes peremptory challenges help clean mistakes safeguard fundamental sixth amendment value stake the peremptory challenge also serves symbolic atmospheric purposes making defendant comfortable jury actually going decide fate giving assurance community litigants participated jury selection body actually decides case fairly disposed decide based facts evidence law the question since jury actually sat indisputably impartial additional values peremptory challenge reassurance litigants fairness trial reassurance community verdict respected  values sufficient justify throwing results otherwise fair trial and judgment they important values constitutionally protected values they neither values go fundamental fairness judgment go reliability ultimate conviction ensued case and result thats correct thats correct i dont think theres question view could said infringement rulebased right the first position courts consideration federal law ought construed way oklahoma law construed ross v oklahoma say peremptory challenge properly regarded serving purpose protecting impartiality jury oklahoma law justice ginsburg there nothing statutes rules governed court determined whether would procedural error defendant use peremptory challenge cure forcause strike put another way whether defendant cure error forcause denial deprived anything protected rules well justice scalia i dont think i halves rule i would interpretation i dont think essential court agree order agree infringement peremptory challenge defendant actually case assuming could get review lets biased juror sit jury actually factfinder doesnt satisfy sixth amendment court determines thats error warrants review either reserved  preserved error plain error doesnt mean also opportunity way actually using peremptory challenge remove biased juror still getting reversal theory peremptory challenge rights infringed and thats fundamentally part company respondent respondent would defendant automatically gets reversal conviction judge makes even single error assessing forcause challenge and uncommon experience federal system one reasons doesnt result reversal convictions many circuits employ rule advocating if defendant uses peremptory challenge juror doesnt actually sit defendant suffered sort harm warrants reversing conviction even  thats right even juror removed peremptory challenge thats position third circuit would take and thats disagree case most courts adopted rule automatic reversal sorts errors peremptory challenge process relied swain v alabama dictum appears decision court said denial peremptory challenge important warrants reversal without showing error now swain course didnt involve question infringement defense peremptory challenges that statement relationship facts case but swain citing relying cases 19th century reversed convictions without inquiry whether harmful error those decisions preceded enactment federal harmless error statute federal harmless error rule and submission that dictum authoritative case announced event followed court today approach taken federal law error sorts harms warrant reversal shall disregarded now two ways look problem harmless error one say  perceptible effect  outcome case when denial peremptory challenge way say perceptible effect outcome case that kind analysis applies evidence shouldnt admitted admitted evidence excluded let case possible make analysis entire record determine whether injurious error the category harmless error analysis court sometimes referred structural error sort fundamental deprivation basic elements trial process and context court look see whether effect outcome case reversal automatic the ninth circuit sorted error structural error box the governments position wrong way categorize error level errors merit treatment structural error i think judges make close calls virtually every case juries empaneled many jurors on forcause challenges much whether juror actually qualified whether hes citizen whether hes 18 whether speaks english question whether juror really impartial thats right principle abuse discretion hard overcome so challenges forcause judge rejects result appellate reversal but important remember jury selection doesnt take place parties transcripts front jurors actually said they rely recollections judge parties youre dealing lot different jurors in case read jury selection process many many jurors brought individual questioning things said questionnaire some jurors questioned closely whether would favor one side ultimately concluded yes your honor i would able follow instructions apply law facts case when  juror actually sits case yes there  courts treat waiver defendants right challenge juror well hard leave peremptories justice breyer what  normally   dont go theory correct and cases treat failure exercise peremptory waiver right complain impartiality jury lack impartiality jury correct the judge probably inherent authority it he terms rule one could read rules quite strictly say multidefendant cases judge in fact process jury selection basically aimed towards achieving impartial factfinder decide case judge latitude ensure basically gets right strong interest assuring finality verdict its hard get everybody come court trial it costs lot money it takes lot time everybody once done judge certain amount latitude make sure particular jury subject assailed appeal in case example question arose whether one selected jurors could sit jury absconded jury selection didnt quite come back instructions court later found brought back court the judge said i dont really want problems the defendant objected the governments position sort middle im going put guy jury i assurance reversible error claims remain end jury selection id like save remainder time rebuttal there many things trial judge orchestrating jury selection effects defendants peremptory challenges equally severe severe one the trial judge multidefendant case require defendants exercise peremptory challenges together without extending additional challenges defendant reduced number effect 10 provided rule 5 hes sharing another defendant the trial judge require parties select jury exercising challenges simultaneously fact happened case and event defendant may exercise challenges somebody would removed government event and trial judge say parties must make challenge cause instantaneously denied exercise peremptory challenge  dont may challenge juror each entirely legitimate procedures may defendants point view infringe would otherwise free untrammeled right exercise peremptory challenges the rule ask defendant actually exercise peremptory challenge remove juror removed cause cannot claim error appeal he given substance right basis reversing conviction thank you,492.0,842,19,well hear argument no 981255 united states v abel martinezsalazar mr dreeben mr dreeben  mentioned i think peremptory challenge right impairment what source peremptory challenge rights i take it really impossible justify ninth circuits reasoning theres constitutional question talking federal rules but far rules concerned mr dreeben case  perhaps larger  face peremptory challenge rule federal rule exists civil side so argument today based consequences allowing challenge cause improperly   would follow equally civil peremptory forcause challenges do adequately preserve object say i want extra peremptory suppose  suppose biased juror seated wrongfully all peremptories exercised ask additional peremptory is  preserving right even peremptories left judge doesnt give one no im assuming didnt so theres never prejudice there never prejudice okay but   thats accepting juror excused cause there never prejudice effect abridgement  peremptory challenge right but  effect   says forget peremptories the  issue pursue issue biased juror claimed excused cause well i think says forget judge doesnt let issue pursued issue biased juror excused cause what  doesnt  fact goes trial i take end trial would get relief theory absent seating biased juror excused cause anyway mr dreeben well i suppose rule works way around   i suppose trial judge could say know theres lot close forcause issues im sure you guys  people exercise peremptories first ill rule forcause would get reversal appeal would get appeal thats  thats issue you  would say still reversal appeal unless theres what   i take governments position peremptories must used strike biased juror suppose  suppose counsel certain biased juror  seated objection use last peremptory strike  biased juror he says im going use peremptory somebody else and biased juror  seated now governments position  theres harm peremptory could used strike biased juror do fallback position because one attractive so whats second position so  could well lets suppose dont accept governments proposal first choice then whats fallback position you dont retreat far order overcome objection justice oconnor i find rather  rather significant that say still maintain first position harmless error without going step say moreover even biased juror seated one peremptory left could used strike  harmless error i mean  goes beyond  seems  need say order sustain case   primary theory your primary theory biased juror seated theres harm and hypothetical ive given biased juror seated youre trying know take bigger bite say moreover doesnt even matter biased juror seated long peremptory left could used strike i  i dont know go far dont fall back way second theory you still use first  first biased juror theory but mr dreeben would leave case lawyer says i know i dont basis challenge cause i cant say would biased juror but seems fishy i dont think hed good client thats peremptory supposed and  say would immunized appeal just bad but case even  i think  gave us outset three stopping points in case could say well even rule doesnt make  defendant didnt point juror sitting jury defendant would exercised peremptory yes nothing   dont want anything turn whether requested perempt because anything everybody going request perempt going case does government take position purpose peremptory challenge provided rules is obtain impartial jury also permitted  one permitted uses get jury thats simply favorable client impartial yes i know of course case doesnt decided constitutional grounds theoretically could right rules yes but mr dreeben theres word advisory committee note suggests federal peremptory challenge used judge makes error cause that oklahoma law but read federal rules civil side criminal side say x number peremptory challenges oh you go put another way whether doesnt challenge fails use  challenge fails use peremptory get rid hes injured i mean oklahoma rule must use  must use  peremptory rule youre arguing since youre talking  oklahoma rule youre saying federal statute interpreted way i assume thats want us interpret federal statute mr dreeben i asked civil case third circuit kirk raymark industries case took position civil side ninth circuit took criminal side denied challenge cause improperly get new trial the third circuit yes do  way tell us often difficult forcause questions come trial courts i  i feeling often judge really make close call forcause on  forcause challenges but easier case government appeal juror seated cases like wainright witt defer  trial judges ruling thing are  courts cause  excuse juror cause the judge says the judge wrong appeal are courts dont give new trial circumstance im leaving peremptories yes oh leaving peremptories i see they go theory its oklahoma type theory i mean ones dont either give new trial go theory i question terms rules in case like multiple defendants i  i guess clear judge could given perempts could allowed beyond   10 in case single defendant judge discretion increase number but terms rule very well mr dreeben mr gordon well hear thank mr dreeben the case submitted,1120.0,1884,0,mr chief justice may please court i think justice souters question regarding  whether would prejudice ever found governments proposed rule telling what discussing two alternative propositions addressing harmless error case if government correct primary position case error almost always harmless that  thats correct only  trial court made 10 errors federal system would ever occur otherwise governments primary theory defendant would waived right assert sixth amendment violation later road well i agree i think governments position offers defendant nothing relegates peremptory challenge nothing less tool clean trial court errors forcause challenges and i think it completely ignores primary core value peremptory challenge analytically peremptory challenges distinct forcause challenges they intended exercised otherwise qualified jury pool well i  i would disagree well justice oconnor i would disagree characterization two reasons first need look system exists today circuits taken position consistent ninth circuit court appeals the primary question whether district court made mistake respect forcause challenge already reviewed abuse discretion standard it allows district court quite lot discretion ever reversing conviction we understand even governments reply brief concede that decision virtually unassailable its rare case perhaps 2 maybe 1 percent cases ever reach position district court abused discretion failed remove juror cause i would suggest existence peremptory challenges allow  allow courts appeals comfort  applying discretionary standard review the second issue no i disagree proposition defendant right use challenge peremptory challenge event way sees fit when district court made mistake respect forcause challenge viewing prospective juror juror gilbert case said would favor prosecution looking jurors another kind bias kind bias cannot articulated it cannot expressed meaningful way i think thats  thats partially true i dont think illogical sense i think question ought addressed judiciary legislative branch i think i think justice scalia ignores reality trial as government explained defense attorney defend case win case he wanted objectively fair impartial jury required sixth amendment wanted able remove jurors perceived prejudiced case after understand peremptory challenges we peremptory challenges entrust counsel intuit respect prospective jurors case defense counsel with due respect justice ginsburg i disagree proposition two reasons the first take look record defendant  forcause challenge denied denied twice the defendant asked forcause challenge granted it denied the defense remind  reminded district court  juror indicated disregard presumption innocence prior ruling district court indicated defendant wanted use peremptory challenge could use peremptory challenge it ignores realities trial defendant stand sit wherever ask  ask district court something expressly denied in case  secondly well  earliest possible opportunity could done time peremptory challenge  forcause challenge denied it would exercising peremptory challenges we know first meaningful opportunity arose ask additional peremptory challenges juror  prospective juror  actually became petit juror finck ended missing asked additional peremptory challenge in fact asked twice additional peremptory challenge we keep eye ball view the eye ball government prove  dealing harmless error prove actions prejudice and question record defendant told use peremptory challenge thats wanted defendant asked additional peremptory challenges  juror finck ended missing  first day trial actually objected composition jury whether record government able prove absence prejudice thats correct and i think demonstrates given opportunity exercise peremptory challenges along fact exhausted peremptory challenges intended use peremptory challenge well thats  well know defense counsel government exercising peremptories focus beginning panel i mean thats  theyre  theyre looking likely jurors end sitting petit the fact  juror end may ended sitting  really act fortuity that juror and i agree but point a defendant  defense counsel case trial counsel case could speculated correctly that juror likely sit petit jury petit jury petit jury b  b opportunity exercise peremptory challenge that absolutely correct i disagree we   i think youre  amici the part laughter well ill leave decide laughter the amici points i think quite accurately must distinguish pointing error pointing consequences error in case district court denied peremptory challenge  forcause challenge logical consequence defendant going exercise peremptory challenge remove and fact know record thats exactly district court anticipated defense counsel moved strike juror cause well next  well thats harm the harm error no i dont think thats  i dont think error i think well consequence error i think  really  playing words little bit consequence error denial peremptory challenge rights natural consequence consequence flow  denial forcause challenge sixth amendment justice scalia i think i believe need understand value jury system the reason jury system healthy disrespect  healthy respect distance court jury its buffer defendant during trial rule 24 plays subtle role healthy distance two the district court makes objective review prospective jurors the defendant sitting defense counsel opportunity disagree rulings disagree peremptory challenge gives right but district court incorrect objective viewing  conceded case error must reversed and i think important understand defendant case receives windfall governments second fallback position third fallback position precisely conviction would reversed courts decision ross v oklahoma the play speak i think important i think play resolved highly deferential standard review given district court reviews sorts errors if defendant would left peremptory challenge used peremptory challenge another juror clear record prospective juror gilbert would become juror sat alternate jury under courts decision ross v oklahoma although werent facts specific case well im assuming two things number one im assuming governments concession would hold true appellate court level juror actually sat juror gilbert would sat hypothetical would fair  rather unfair partial juror sit jury panel and reading courts decision ross violation defendants right  sixth amendment fair impartial jury sat ultimately i wanted go back justice scalias question i think need look whether appropriate court rule rule 24 actually embraces notion whether defendant required remove jurors i  i think sense put gun somebodys head got 10 peremptories he forced use meaningful sense word the defendant trial facing score years prison if wanted fair impartial jury least know retrospect judge abuse discretion standard abused discretion he let juror sit said no at court appeals fact position government took district court abused discretion juror gilbert  removal  failure remove  i apologize  prospective juror gilbert abuse discretion the court appeals held otherwise case and upon filing petition rehearing suggestion rehearing en banc ninth circuit petition certiorari court government changed position actually flip case say  said ninth circuit agree court abused discretion think violates due process  level court took  government took opposite position case i i mean i think i agree i think cases court decided example logan v zimmerman example hicks v oklahoma  glean well i agree i think  i think case goes cases way margin what looking laughter i mean i dont know i speak i think laughter well laughter the  i think glean logan v zimmerman  hicks v oklahoma important rights stake  indeed one important rights afforded criminal defendant  denial right rise procedural due process levels i  i agree and i  i dont think necessary  i hope i set forth clearly brief its necessary court reach conclusion  procedural due process violation order affirm ninth circuits opinion it would obviously affirmed different grounds way but find rule 24 violation going leapfrog difficult area i think area dealing structural error versus nonstructural error appropriate harmless error standard and court faced two diverging options one no i going say one requires reversal almost time  get past discretionary standard review one requires finding harmlessness time  unless district court makes unfortunate series 10 rulings erroneously  forcause challenges im sorry interrupting justice souter raise good point its  answer i couldnt find case regard and i think  reason case different look peremptory challenge truly unique tool creation jury i think number peremptory challenges decision chief justice left grace congress case and going change number peremptory challenges proposed government requiring defendant affirmatively really engage prosecution clean sixth amendment violations requiring  modifying rule 24 substantive drastic way and procedures i believe title 28 allow court recommend changes rule 24 allow congress reject accept modifications and know that procedure employed last 20 years we know rule 24 modified since swains decision 1965 i think focus justice ginsburg  necessarily right fair impartial jury although i think thats important correct i think thats true but take look rule 52 speak effect substantial right the substantial right involved case right peremptory challenge what i think adopt yes i think  view and i think courts view i agree cant and i hope thats i said what im trying say court ruled continuously since last century holland case right peremptory challenge essential right afforded accused jury trial process and reason essential allows defendant play role jury selection outside role judge it really furthers goal trial jury  respect and weve recognized  court continually recognized trial jury deserves peremptory challenge in fact court holland stated although court previously stilson said necessary right sixth amendment arguably substantive right right essential  right peremptory challenge  cannot trumped sixth amendment example holland im sorry justice ginsburg well i think im saying due process would always require 10 peremptories the decision whether  number peremptory challenges offered criminal defendant decision made legislature case congress well i dont  i dont believe i think matter observed its matter arbitrarily denied and speak arbitrary denial peremptory challenge case talking district court denying forcause challenge i think  i dont agree concept i think district court makes  abuses discretion makes arbitrary capricious decision evidenced  standard review case denies forcause challenge defendant  prospective juror case states would favor prosecution never effectively way retreat position fact arbitrary denial i think perfectly acceptable depending  well hypothetical chief justice rule amended i think mr chief justice i dont think i dont think i agree i think i agree i  i  need  i needed understand chief justices position amended rule amended appropriately and long rule view amended congress least amended procedures set forth congress would  certainly procedural due process violation we  i mean need  need look cases late last century early century in every instance court looked whether peremptory challenges provided defendant essential right deselect jurors court cases it held but court cases werent reversing convictions in every one cases cited government harrison v united states court said error made defendant forced deselect proper jurors precisely two reasons one  court looked nature peremptory challenges  undermined court didnt reverse conviction and number two court looked terms statutes involved rules procedure involved  stated defendant received precisely entitled federal rules  rules procedure they werent federal time well let state way in order rule expressly approved  order rule amended expressly approved congress the alternative looking rule 24 exists today without modification assuming i think appropriately interpretation correct deprivation right violates rule procedures set forth rule 24 nonetheless i think  point im trying make  chief justice rehnquist points cases fringe dealing fundamental rights erroneous denial procedural right rise procedural due process violation and  i agree justice scalia dont go far i think need decide rule 24 amended ought amended  accordance procedure violation rule 24 instance what district court case    i wasnt part trial they exercised peremptory challenge conclusion voir dire case,688.0,1106,27,that  error would harmless biased juror fact seated isnt correct but  biased juror seated yes  would able claim error harmful  ability totally superfluous it doesnt give anything wouldnt without anyway youd able say juror excused error failure grant motion strike cause yes rule propose would turn every forcause ruling judge automatic reversal seems and i think would troublesome i mean shouldnt  shouldnt client put  hard choice sure  impropriety seating juror shouldnt wasted one peremptories it really choice shoot peremptory wasnt well thats  thats one  one  thats one version certainly now i wont say implausible in ross case oklahoma different version and i  i think states follow i mean inexorable one reach conclusion reach peremptories valuable never used repair possible error part trial judge but  government isnt  doesnt say  forced use theyre  dont need oklahomas position it isnt question whether waste peremptory the fact chose use peremptory way question did get 10 peremptories answer you got 10 peremptories you chose waste one strike juror would  disqualified cause anyway your remedy problem sure get case reversed appeal chose use one 10 peremptories it seems havent harmed it choice but mr gordon case wasnt even suggestion counsel i extra peremptory juror 10 would panel so talking kind abstract terms case neither biased juror sitting panel even one defense counsel said i would challenged one i could for record could said your honor ive obliged use peremptory i want record i would used one jurors well asked perempt wasnt juror excused going replaced was but  absconding juror fact replaced alternate peremptory exercised but could peremptory challenge exercised alternate wasnt petit jury but case isnt make sure i understand answer justice ginsburgs question time original panel selection plus selection alternate concluded client point go court counsel didnt go court say judge i want exercise one peremptory i cant forced use  strike juror i object cause he how judge supposed know hes making mistake i mean judges arent mindreaders you argue judge made mistake law never told or wasnt i mean lawyer didnt tell judge youre making mistake thats point object what part disagree the part judges arent mindreaders part so error denying forcause challenge certainly could appeal error of course unfortunately didnt hurt didnt sit all right whats next error no i mean error made i agree made error denying forcause challenge now another error made youre another error no its consequence choose use one peremptories im  im less interested harmless error issue i issue whether violation rule it seems weve discussing  know question whether  whether judge excuses somebody cause  black white you category jurors stricken cause rest shouldnt stricken cause in real world  clear maybe review comes trial judge spectrum and  could go either category why isnt realistic  view rule 24 saying look youre doubt whether clearly falls category  stricken cause thats one things peremptories and used way got full 10 peremptories no violation rule period it depends upon whether view purpose rule 24 embracing ability defendant strike jurors  know maybe excused cause maybe shouldnt if view purpose rule 24 know allow  play joints seems  simply violation you use  use peremptory exactly one purposes designed take care doubtful cases maybe  maybe stricken cause maybe shouldnt but peremptory choose  im saying must use way choose use way case involves you got 10 peremptories well say case would reversed ross oklahoma this case well makes rather difficult say  different case would reversed ross doesnt rule  rule 24 face course doesnt embrace notion get 10 peremptories your client got 10 peremptories that never reviewed court appeals it stipulated and court appeals held otherwise case you dont  dont think due process situation how say talking violation rule we dont reach constitutional questions decide rules statutes those way margin i think well want case decided way regarded way margin i think good advocate would say under jurisprudence dont reach constitutional question unless find statute requires particular thing and construing statute  rule seems generally conceded could construed one way and construe rule  way give client relief seeks isnt basis  ross constitutional dont final say oklahoma statutes construed im sorry go have ever used  structural error concept context constitutional one have ever used find  statutory  harmful statutory violation i dont think but know i  im sure would raise grave constitutional question state abolished peremptory challenges sides i realize thats debatable doesnt seem  know  say youre entitled unbiased jury one would disagree but say youre entitled matter fundamental fairness 10 peremptory challenges i think lot people would disagree but rule 24 doesnt say anything automatic reversal its part set rules one hand get 10 peremptory challenges hand disregard errors substantial and impartial jury fact one say substantial right  substantial right impartial jury  affected well thats right sounds like constitutional dimensions well thats  thats say question substantial right purposes rule 52 then youre saying anytime dont get rules say get affects substantial right cant well  i suppose say due process saying peremptories  merely peremptories 10 peremptories required due process that seems youre saying and say whatever number legislature picks number observed theres one short due process violation im clear mean arbitrarily denied and youre suggesting trial court wasnt acting total good faith trying achieve unbiased jury he may made mistake call arbitrary i think questionable what  rule 24 read side shall get 10 peremptory challenges challenges shall required exercised case like  lawyer view district court erroneously denied forcause challenge exactly would constitutional  could  could constitutional challenge rule like i mean hard question i mean weve said several times dont constitutionally peremptory challenges well give 10 say got use correct errors judge could possibly constitutional violation but  court days reversed convictions right left would never reversed today mr gordon maybe i shouldnt waste time youre relying exclusively constitutional violation but i dont understand constitutional violation accept rule rewritten pursuant chief justices hypothetical would constitutional  government argues written statute acknowledge would  would constitutional but say since written statute interpret statute way would somehow unconstitutional  get constitutional violation acknowledge could happen expressly approved congress i see argument i cant see step violates constitution may i ask case trial judge require peremptory challenge used right particular juror interrogated could saved peremptories till end  12 jurors ready seated say ill  ill challenge a b c i

article iii standing that im explaining claims somewhat show fit within standing requirements article iii exceptions third party standing powers your honors id also like direct attention i could states brief the state brief agree forms petitioner campbells claims three grounds with respect equal protection ground page 22 note 9 state louisiana recognizes courts decision discrimination selection grand jury occurs proper remedy reversal subsequent conviction thats happened there discrimination selection grand jury grand juror number 12 chosen discriminatory manner with respect due process claim page 26 note 12 guice 2 fifth circuit noted foreman louisiana selected venire rather grand jury discrimination selection foreman necessarily taints composition grand jury well only 11 12 members chosen random if petitioner may obtain relief challenging composition grand jury failed but fact mr campbell beginning hes saying twelfth member grand jury chosen discriminatory manner always chosen white and page 30 b heading respect sixth amendment argument state writes court decides sixth amendment implicated regardless whether judicial body issue grand jury grand jury foreman state concedes holland v illinois petitioner standing assert sixth amendment challenge its law constitution amendments prior decisions court forced state make concessions issues in dissent justice scalia chief justice rehnquist joined case powers v ohio theres statement it would absurd page 1379 supreme court recorder 111 it would absurd suppose black juror right discriminated peremptory strike trial black defendant trial white defendant however absurd position state taken an african american prospective grand juror right discriminated selection grand jury foreperson cases involving black defendants cases involving white defendants in conclusion brief page 34 state says louisiana way condones race discrimination administration criminal justice corner however states presence today shows otherwise this court opportunity power correct racial discrimination administration criminal justice currently accepted state louisiana if questions id reserve balance time may please court i would like address points raised general ieyoub the injury harm involved youre looking claims would fall article iii standing right indicted nonimpartial grand jury that denied opportunity impartial grand jury look evidence presented grand jury say going indict manslaughter even going indict that right citizens mr campbell convicted however right grand jury look evidence say going indict manslaughter your honor arent arguing conviction fundamentally unfair we arguing denied rights grand jury stage your honor theres long line cases court find racial discrimination grand jury well respect due process i believe due process harm order convicted sentenced life sentence louisiana citizen right indictment grand jury grand jury impartial well your honor evidence record cant see evidence record thats pointed clearly vasquez v hillery case which says cannot determine well your honor analysis argument right cannot tell harm youre allowed look deliberations look votes equally strong due process area equal protection area your honor thats would disagree your honor peters v kiff your honor case involving i believe petit juries and extended grand juries here harm hes given chance grand jury say know defendant may may done going find manslaughter subject life sentence i dont recall your honor okay your honor id like your honors id like address issues one general ieyoub raised point 9 votes needed grand jury case would seem urging issue urging rule could discriminate 3 12 grand jury members still get 9 votes ones valid indictment i dont believe good rule general ieyoub also argued louisiana supreme court said grand jury foreman ministerial look grand jury louisiana supreme court said that case review the problem systematic exclusion judge petitioner campbell denied standing raise claims whenever state argued start going merits claims they start saying hes got prove prove respect due process yet petitioner campbell isnt given opportunity prove whether due process violation equal protection violation sixth amendment violation hes given standing assert if theres questions id yield time,618.0,868,34,well hear argument next number 961584 terry campbell v louisiana mr burnes well hear is true theres never nonwhite foreman evangeline county but youre saying years time frame talking nonwhite theres difference way foreperson selected new orleans right is experience different so dont know whether evangeline county unique louisiana represents general way things this issue so apparently parishes thing uhhuh let ask since youre interrupted make faircrosssectionofthejury claim regard foreperson jury how would work connection single person foreperson how would apply faircrosssection theory i guess couple theories equal protection due process certainly isnt clear fair crosssection claim could made right youre pursuing claim nonetheless well would like justify since youre pursuing how work there 300 people big venire called and judge selects someone large number foreperson grand jury and subsequently members grand jury selected random clerk something sort what foreperson grand jury louisiana can cast vote and left states description powers page 26 well said ministerial duties might called ministerial hes also vote also voting member is different situation hobby case where court said grand jury foreman case ministerial role but hobby foreman chosen why different why different case but hobby objection wasnt the foreman foreperson always white but choice made discriminatory fashion people already chosen i mean discrimination still well hobby focused remedy and look standing were concerned today remedy standing well i thought questions petition refer whether client standing raise equal protection claim due process claim fair crosssection claim it didnt occur intended ask us apply remedy other rule standing claim send back i assume if determine standing matters mr burnes going back peters v kiff case court allowed someone challenge discriminatory selection petit jury grand jury one cases result ever anything conviction got set aside might conceivably case standing recognized court could say havent shown fact discrimination selection mr burnes wanted bring issue youre obligated put question presented i think justice oconnor pointed you three subdivisions every one limited standing fairly subsumed i think i think means general language question includes something perhaps lesser seems standing remedy two distinct things now case client raised claims along proceedings theres problem waiver anything kind these preserved i take im sorry i didnt understand bare claim are also raising urging campbell standing raise denial equal protection nonwhite might selected the first equal protection question sort i mean strange assertion equal protection why isnt perfectly valid answer that well black man could object this grand jury black man couldnt objected grand jury foreman always black thats perfectly fair its almost gameplaying say equal protection violation its standing question simple simply put does standing right would perfectly equal protection louisiana rules black man standing challenge exclusion blacks white man standing challenge exclusion whites neither one standing challenge opposite whats unequal thats right it ruled standing question it wasnt dressed equal protection claim i dont understand i dont understand equal protection claim thats the standing question right wrong it doesnt become right wrong theres denial equal protection involved come way thats either right wrong very well mr burnes general ieyoub well hear but look look i mean i problem due process standing i problem merits due process claim supposed assertion conviction fundamentally unfair your client petit jury fairly chosen made claim that wasnt fairly chosen found client guilty beyond reasonable doubt crime alleged now function grand jury beforehand find whether hes guilty beyond reasonable doubt find whether theres reason believe adequate reason believe might committed tried well goodness weve gone beyond i mean games a petit jury said yeah theres reason believe guilty beyond reasonable doubt what fundamentally unfair clients conviction but could possible mistake grand jurys found probable cause given petit jury found beyond reasonable doubt hes guilty i mean i know terrible thing exclude people like maybe somebody im sure black grand juror excluded could set right justice department could bring suit set right i dont see client convicted fundamentally unfair manner hes petit jury fairly chosen found guilty beyond reasonable doubt he right error made somebody correct error deprive make conviction fundamentally unfair its conviction i mean youre asking something else money damages know something different maybe youve got claim clients conviction fundamentally unfair well mechanic case federal courts held even though federal grand jury conform requirements set congress nonetheless person convicted shortcomings grand jury harmless error why doesnt thing follow situation insofar due process claim concerned but due process cases well say impartial suggests members grand jury prejudiced client now theres evidence is which equal protection case youre melding together equal protection clause fourteenth amendment due process clause seems you know seems sort gaming theory criminal justice your client different grand jury might lucky enough get grand jury didnt find sufficient cause bring indictment might lucky although clear sufficient cause bring indictment indeed found guilty beyond reasonable doubt i find hard find deprivation fundamental fairness the issue grand jury whether enough evidence bring prosecution thats established conviction its established fortiori its established 10 times conviction beyond reasonable doubt i find hard see clients deprived fundamental fairness does peters v kiff help and grand jury i think was majority opinion court kiff i thought i thought really dont know 333 i recall thank mr burnes the case submitted,975.0,1464,38,mr chief justice may please court first your honors i would like correct statements made counsel petitioner he seems indicate wholesale discrimination around state louisiana selection grand jury foremen theres never proof in fact i know personal knowledge black foremen grand juries throughout state louisiana thats correct thats correct your honor also insofar selection foreman concerned louisiana judge select large grand jury venire general venire 300 persons what happens grand jury venire brought courtroom it 20 many 100 grand jury venire brought courtroom judge selects foreman grand jury venire venire shown satisfy general qualifications serve grand jurors 11 chosen it takes 9 12 reach indictment fact grand jury foreman necessarily voting member grand jury necessarily portend responsibility classified merely ministerial no your honor that stipulated state your honor orleans parish treated differently throughout louisiana law nobody knows except fact people orleans parish think theyre different rest state fact throughout louisiana law exceptions orleans parish i cant give your honor reason well your honor orleans parish judge choose foreman judge also selects 11 but thats i understand done orleans parish now places orleans parish judge select grand jury foreman 11 randomly selected box thats way done no your honor i dont think thats case in evangeline parish course ive stated judge selects grand jury venire 11 chosen randomly 11 grand jurors it doesnt appear way your honor basically your honor i think involves basically ensuring proceedings go orderly way setting forth specific distinct rules procedure the grand jury foreman stated louisiana supreme court louisiana supreme court interpreted louisiana law mean grand jury foremans duties fact ministerial yes your honor foreman voting member grand jury has power set procedure also codal article louisiana code criminal procedure states grand jurors may rule court disagree hes relative procedure takes place grand jury indication power greater thats correct your mr chief justice that correct your honor vasquez v hillery petitioner i understand member excluded class in case article iii standing equal protection your honor insofar powers concerned i would point court powers granted third party standing personal standing article iii insofar equal protection goes thats correct your honor no your honor sense reason i dont finding petitioner powers satisfied three criteria necessary third party standing injury fact relationship third party hindrance third party able bring action court placed strong emphasis importance voir dire phase trial adverse impact discrimination voir dire voir dire stage would fairness trial in finding injury fact court pointed theres discrimination voir dire stage use peremptory challenges discrimination body thats going decide guilt innocence thats true insofar grand jury concerned the discrimination takes place trial obviously grand jury proceedings long i agree your honor i think cases relative theres question grave consequences discrimination racial discrimination grand juries most cases whenever petitioner attacked entire grand jury venire peters v kiff case entire venire attacked rose v mitchell involve attacking discrimination foreman petitioner particular case member excluded class thats correct your honor i think powers extended cover case your honor powers court speaking third criteria hindrance party excluded bringing action stated said your honor would difficult individual juror excluded voir dire bring actions rare secondly difficult individual juror prove would discrimination recurring voir dire stage that doesnt hold true particular case i think court pointed powers discrimination use peremptory exceptions individual jurors different systematic exclusion clerks jury commissioners judges numerous actions brought individual blacks alleging discrimination discrimination selection foreman grand jury there seems hindrance terry campbell poor champion third party rights particular case taylor v louisiana yes again your honor i would suggest taylor taylor made valid due process claim entire grand jury venire entire venire exclusion systematic exclusion women as particular grand jury represent varieties human experience qualities human well your honor your honor equal protection equal protection claim your honor i would claim claim due process violated courts announcement theres discrimination 112th grand jury grand jury foreman i think analysis whether discrimination one person significant appreciable impact administration criminal justice thats thats correct that white person yes your honor yes i concede well your honor hobby v united states felt course hobby remedied theres question hobby v united states court court found discrimination one individual fact maintains ministerial position rest grand jury whole meets representational requirements values due process violation due we would win merits well no your honor first individual show injury fact that injury palpable it distinct it cant hypothetical analytical your honor court court speak standing hobby thats correct your honor thats correct your honor we different circumstances case existed hobby your honor let explain first relevant standing issue first injury fact in case instance campbells injury fact mr campbell suffered injury fact he suffered palpable distinct injury i think hobby shows no no your honor theyre alike regard secondly causation causation injury fairly traceable conduct complained illegal injury in case state respectfully submits way injury petitioner fairly traceable fact might discrimination grand jury foreman in fact case petitioners grand jury three blacks grand jury he six blacks petit jury convicted he used five peremptory exceptions knock five blacks state used one peremptory exception how said theres causation standing and finally redressability it shown yes your honor well well your honor court held fact theres discrimination found racial discrimination in grand jury discrimination no your honor well even say harm fact individual indicted must i show order indictment come terry campbells case took 9 9 12 we dont know vote grand jury whether foreman actually voted indictment event i dont see injury way fairly traceable alleged misconduct misconduct might alleged no your honor now insofar due process concerned addition injury fact causation redressability that means petitioner must likely favorable decision court standing would grant relief hes asking would case i dont think in light hobby v united states if court would find instance might standing your honor say discrimination affect hobby hobby thats correct your honor even affects composition grand jury determine whether particular effect violates due process values making claim due process clause what i saying fact may discrimination foreman case way violates due process values stated i think louisiana supreme court interpreting law stated basically grand jury foremans duties ministerial in addition hobby no your honor federal federal grand jury foreman also voting member im mistaken thats right the composition affected your honor affected and let point hobby addition talking well well course petitioner would prove right would prove in addition your honor speaking foreman ministerial responsibilities foreman hobby court pointed discrimination one individual hobby happened foreman discrimination one individual grand jury whole rest grand jury satisfied representational requirements due process would enough find violation petitioners rights your honor i think fact shown systematic exclusion number individuals your honor i would say one enough we would take casebycase basis your honor i would whenever petitioner makes claim grand jury venire entire venire large part venire selected discriminatory way due process values violated in particular your honor i dont think would standing make claim i said earlier theres allegation discrimination foreman grand jury one 12 i dont think would standing make claim yes your honor i dont think well your honor i dont think petitioner case i argued really satisfied criteria article iii standing allen v wright thats correct your honor i dont know court didnt address necessarily address standing hobby they found violation due process rights would argue hobby hold remedy yes your honor remedy the basic claim petitioner particular case has third party standing assert rights third party thats basic claim thats chief claim his lawyer stood motion quash argued saying terrys rights violated he asserting rights third party excluded it always third party standing suggest powers v ohio doesnt third party standing powers v ohio granted third party standing particular nature voir dire phase trial types discrimination took place time that occur how world say respect your honors bond trust created petitioner third party whenever theres selection grand jury foreman the defendant even present court practical matter as long yes your honor yes yes your honor all right yes not equal protection i think due process white person would that well theory would your honor significant impact theres significant impact administration criminal justice due process representational values satisfied second case but case third party standing he shown satisfies criteria article iii stated injury fact causation redressability no your honor i think replaced grand juries louisiana sit less 4 months 8 grand jury dispensed grand jury foreman changes thats correct your honor thats correct your honor unlike tennessee rose case grand juror jury foreman could sit 2 years long judge wanted sit but your honors due respect feel petitioner powers conviction affirmed this court always adding stories temples constitutional law your honors court please urge justice jacksons caution temples way collapsing one many stories added your honors request conviction affirmed,702.0,1092,41,but problem i mean wants standing make claim then youd prove right and youd say wasnt hed say wed argument general ieyoub dont dispute figures presented last 16 years theres never nonwhite grand jury foreperson evangeline county so wouldnt matter went counties except theres curiosity louisiana law im sure tell it doesnt work way new orleans in new orleans foreperson selected group 12 instead separately why but wouldnt problem throughout state way parish maybe i remember statute wrong i thought others selected new orleans like evangeline foreperson so youre saying new orleans theres random selection i one quick thing brief it says say said grand jury foremans role ministerial says brief grand jury may determine rules procedure what mean may determine rules procedure if power determine rules procedure thats enormously important power i mean involve well foreman voting member grand jury and power set procedure well mr that still doesnt power ministerial unless say power foreman ministerial every bit much power grand juror voting indictments thats correct isnt and vasquez v hillery court referred grave constitutional trespass occurs jurors particular race intentionally excluded grand jury proof case one member grand jury blacks always excluded foreperson selection doesnt fit vasquez v hillery why isnt standing raise part petitioner in case powers issue respect trial jury didnt think mattered would different rule grand jury well i guess thats argument do concede least petitioner third party standing powers thats i referred vasquez v hillery description grave constitutional injury occurs grand jury situation it also prepowers court made statement but extent one points made powers person excluded jury one case yes grand jury unlikely challenger kind surrogate standing person excluded either petit jury serving foreperson that would something cant imagine walking court somebody says oh i could foreperson im going sue im going spend resources suing but different say taylor v louisiana taylor certainly taylor complaining women jury man raped woman front child still standing assert claim no youre going substance claim rather issue standing taking argument would position state say fact well announce fact discriminatorily exclude blacks 112th grand jury positions one 12 positions always go white fact would support claim respect invalid composition jury well im responding argument argument i understood correctly somehow respond standing saying claim respect composition grand jury whole if i misunderstood argument tell i thought thats arguing i want see far go im saying im asking state announced right front going discriminate respect 112th positions every grand jury would fact insufficient support claim respect invalid composition jury argument insufficient result standing anybody then answer question alone would support claim but wouldnt i mean isnt say white person standing say grand jury indicted white thats right you concede a white person say werent enough black people grand jury indicted you concede all right now somebody says fine thats claim my claim even one position always white enough black people grand jury indicted could person standing make first argument standing make second argument since second argument first argument so would win merits but would person standing argue systematically discriminating one position creates bad grand jury point view constitution nearly bad discriminating eight nine ten three four i would like make argument constitutionally speaking things equivalent bad wrong event cant least make argument mr attorney general didnt hobby answer standing question there white defendant complained thing i know thats threshold issue nobody questioned standing hobby and course hobby foreman chosen among 12 already picked satisfactory crosssection so isnt hobby answer standing issue case thats end case and theyre relevant standing issue did hobby suffer palpable distinct injury so cases alike regard excuse youre assuming injury ultimate conviction right well i mean thats criterion i suppose theres never standing challenge grand jury i mean harm foul the grand jury meant determine whether theres probable cause bring trial indict matter badly set even make grand jury youre tried petit jury found guilty havent harmed right in in grand jury right suggests argument wrong the harm ultimate conviction there must harm involved but talking alleged injury conviction wouldnt true cases someone member class whether racial gender allowed make challenge the case i brought likely women jury would favorable taylor he certainly didnt prove well may i interrupt question as i think questions indicated agree difference hobby case hobby discrimination affect composition grand jury here if discrimination affected composition grand jury isnt distinction case hobby as i understand correct im wrong hobby grand jury selected after selection process one person designated foreman in case one person designated foreman claim that discriminatory designation determines composition one 12 members grand jury therefore discrimination shown affects composition grand jury one 12 whereas hobby affect one 12 whatever number isnt correct well duties foreman may ministerial we accept sake argument his duty voting member grand jury isnt ministerial let suggest point way as i understand petitioner argument really would essentially person selected method designation court foreman one random member grand jury therefore seems although certainly makes harder case one sense grand jury foremans responsibilities ministerial it doesnt eliminate case composition still affected well claim it affected discriminatory way 112th every grand jury going result racial discrimination thats claim thats thats affected right and thats trials doesnt go question affect standing how many would take 2 12 3 12 4 12 when cross line reading hobby well many one enough whats enough all right how many enough well youre taking casebycase basis youre saying one matter law enough when get point matter law might possible well claim venire discriminatorily chosen individuals discriminatorily chosen venire argument correct never would standing make claim never would claim even though found standing hobby you want us ignore well i dont see if article iii standing hobby court would say motion we said remedy required i guess case isnt i mean suppose judge system deliberately excluded blacks position number 4 position number 4 always white thats illegal isnt pure racial discrimination so exclude blacks always 5 6 7 well white person standing view well 9 10 11 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 now white person standing yes right now whats theory white person standing 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 theyre illegal theyre grand juries theyre i mean thats i think people trying get what would theory thing general ieyoub may i ask another question things work louisiana in brief page 28 said the foreperson presumably replaced every 6 months entire grand jury is reason presumably is so always change including theres difference theres carryover thank general ieyoub mr burnes 8 minutes

special issues problem justice souter created texas court criminal appeals black v state says retreat millimeter back language special issues we wont authorize giving extra instructions its futile ask so dont think jurek overruled fact courts opinion franklin stands testament certain circumstances perhaps many jurek court said jurek said later cases live quite happily together without questioning jurek justice kennedy at margin surely cases issues raised example boyd v california franklin this case 17yearold whose mother mental hospitals 20 30 times so i look eddings closest case see maybe theres opinion majority court answers question i think the court identified two things first factors the eighth amendment mandates certain factors shall considered mitigating youth surely among take stanford a troubled family background surely among then question factor identified evidence eighth amendment also mandates defendant able put evidence now surely state done job done three statutes state case clings good ones saffle blystone boyde say question threshold question whether evidence proffered entitles defendant instruction whether evidence goes sufficiently relates one constitutionally identified mitigating factors thats common question kinds criminal cases involving eighth amendment the court started opinion jacobson example noting evidence different jacobson quote would even entitled instruction the courts wrestling threshold issue ever since 19th century suggest standards could applied but third way evidence underinclusive precisely eddings powerful analysis particularly footnote 11 consensus adolescents tend dangerous particularly teenage years theres sense maybe societys fault not thats dispositive i us would say particular case sentencer words eddings locket requires sentencer listen that comes back jurek point penry says need additional instruction thats consistent jurek because court said griffin capital punishment case in griffin court said juror intuition takes care lot problems facts certainly expect juror intuition able deal law that wont intuition cant save failure court instruct correctly law and another analogy draw think powerful last terms decision morgan v illinois if seating one juror says i aint following mitigating instructions error much error judge says effect jurors cant consider mitigating evidence said because judge finished constricted view law last thing said jury deliberated fate 17yearold young man take law your judge facts take law beyond issue precedent seems us fifth circuit missed eddings point interestingly respondent doesnt embrace fifth circuits opinion deal brief it seems us fifth circuit mistaken reweighing evidence constitutional duty eddings look factors mitigating make sure jury

least 2200 years trace back far in stanford v kentucky court called roll call states it began saying one sure guide eighth amendment duty court look statutes passed societys elected representatives court called roll call 29 states expressly make youth mitigating factor 29 and done clear stanford reading statutes states dont mention youth expressly one catchall clauses catchall mitigating clauses court sustained cases boyde blystone saffle permit lawyers argue without headed pass prosecutorial judicial argument now response contentions make state number things it statistics we didnt bother

whatever say its interesting note 82 81 youths got life sentence arithmetic also interesting note run elementary statistical test null hypothesis results cannot attributed anything significant chance

changed practice statute point brief texas amended statute aid lawyers attorney generals office indeed reason amendment hard find one reads stunning concession page 28 attorney generals brief that say statutory terms issue relate matters might support affirmative answers special issues ie aggravating factors logical connection inquiry whether rational jury could give effect grahams mitigating evidence in short state seems saying factors probably face adapted aggravators additional instructions required penry might answer redeeming jurek promise circumstances particularly instructions asapplied way constricted confined trial judges instructions prosecutors argument theres chance mitigating force evidence could appreciated jury if go back objective reliable indicium say states done clear little like coker v georgia court noted stanford georgia stood alone here texas stands alone within house divided legislative enactment recognized mitigating evidence could considered former statute must given chance heard sentencer that correct justice oconnor yes justice oconnor thats true we asking court illuminate means word character character record circumstances offense language character evidence course receivable unless passes minimal threshold relevance that comes back believe factors evidence here positive character traits must considered eddings i think best case positive character traits existed despite troubled family background that i dont think hitchcock comes mr hitchcock kind uncle i think mr hitchcocks kind uncleness important lifetime adversity still manages mr graham loves lord cares children shows traits despite whats happened so say whatever threshold meet also looking cases boyde court quite frankly assessed relevance evidence factor already identified said might threshold somebody would meet that standard analysis would permit court draw line our view wherever line drawn disagree fifth circuit record combination circumstances even powerful eddings combination court said look whole sentencer authorized focus no justice souter i think franklin answer franklin contend evidence however characterized help jury answer second question case court said adequate the concession state makes page 28 brief however troubles question troubles i suggest court problem maybe true court could conclude second question simply isnt adequate purpose that calculus speak really aggravator state seems suggest then would mean however order redeem promise jurek state court criminal appeals would moderate language little bit instead saying things like never retreat would pay attention court made quid pro quo upholding statute face jurek that say accommodate statute circumstances presented state opportunity repeatedly refused avail it one reason claim couldnt conceivably procedurally defaulted cleared futility i hope ive answered question thank much well i understand mr chief justice im sorry i trying get paper graded improper id like reserve balance time i may we watershed difference jury told case special issue number 1 intent element offense something difference texas law id like try resolve at pages 6 7 brief quoting joint appendix extensive quotations voir dire jurors told deliberately means mind anyway persons intention something remarks effect at joint appendix 5 jury instructions given guilt phase intentionally intent respect nature conduct result conduct conscious objective desire engage conduct cause result now complicated language read section 602a texas penal code differs model penal code quadripartite intent elements texas chooses use word intention rather purposefulness preferred model penal code formulation defined thing its terms conscious objective desire cant doubt trial judge conflated two standards thus took care mitigating force might special issue number 1 the standard proof justice kennedy respect elements really isnt opportunity jury look things looked plus course additional aggravating evidence get punishment phase thats difficulty then look black v state now thats postpenry decision theres defendant no doesnt justice white thats thats correct justice white might lose might lost case defendant 25 years old i mean case different one margin opposed right center thered different result thats meaning asapplied challenge i may interrupt black v state discussion thats think wrong court appeals the court appeals turns penry head doesnt look question youth relationship thing court identified eddings central instead goes future dangerousness thing analyzes regard gets result gets of course justice rehnquist of course i mean court said eddings done there constitutionally mitigating factors theres assessment evidence standard the opinion court boyde v california teach anyone foolhardy enough come whats going happen make argument kind i dont think court needs worry the problem course court criminal appeals decide cases presumably court wont wont want hear the problem court criminal appeals black case page 364 say unless name penry took iq test say retreat means additional jury instructions its futile ask no procedural bar it could perhaps justice white in case that promise jurek well promised jurek going didnt seems difference facial asapplied challenge to look broadly stanford v kentucky court wrote opinion you counted statutes you looked 29 states said lets put youth 29 surely constitutional consensus found inadequate stanford yet quite much one coker i think fair question whether say youth whether one catchall statutes would adequate purposes and final observation i would make told mitigating evidence didnt take many pages transcript the fifth circuit accepted issue resolved the hearsay point i wonder trial counsel state district attorney it wasnt objected the point youth takes word transcript hes 17 evocative power law life 2200 years recorded legal history enough sentencers say oh thats mitigating and court please respectful submission,243.0,277,4,well hear argument number 917580 gary graham v james a collins mr tigar if accept overrule jurek jurek premised fact moral significance could theoretically least considered within framework questions im sure youth consideration could meet test describe unless overrule jurek well seems mr tigar almost case theres going evidence troubled background positive character traits im sure limits rule i experience mr justice souter it seems order rule overrule jurek certainly franklin and probably you raise two excuse questions i believe one youth evidence positive character traits now i suppose isnt defendant world hasnt patted dog kissed sibling kind grandmother time life let ask one question something havent touched course argument you mention brief perhaps theoretical flaw least theoretical inadequacy placing great reliance second texas question prediction future dangerousness because basically nature predictive inquiry whereas judgment must expressed consistent eddings locket moral judgment individual act accept view second question predictive question fact moral question lets say utilitarian sense moral inquiry utilitarian sense follow argument accept practical purposes always penry kind catchall question good enough we pose questions dont answer very well mr tigar mr palmer well hear well jury entitled consider strength states evidence intent mr tigar argument made case judge conflated i suppose doesnt go facial validity texas statute and might win case trial judge spoken differently might lose mr tigar opponent says claims raised texas since penry sociopath effect mitigating circumstance if prevail think would regarded mitigating evidence well could mental retardation likely every case affect somebodys control per se rule separate instruction useful maybe ought decided casetocase basis arguably least texas argues amply taken care issue 1 in case thank mr tigar the case submitted,1235.0,1703,11,mr chief justice may please court grahams claim jury could give mitigating effect constitutional evidence factually legally insufficient establish eighth amendment violation it fails factual matter many assertions legal theory based supported record fails matter law jurek yes sure im sorry one would think grahams mitigating evidence compelling suggests would included join appendix it the joint appendix consists 612 pages 434 devoted voir dire matter mind least bear question presented grahams punishment phase evidence contrast quite scant it may found record volume 20 pages 474 86 it occupies 13 pages record would occupied 7 pages joint appendix yet included examination record reveals i believe reason omission for instance graham tells us worked job support two children the basis assertion six lines hearsay testimony there absolutely competent evidence record graham gainfully employed supported family in theme grahams assertion 17 years characterized religious devotion basis assertion four lines grandmothers testimony attended church ages 3 11 she admitted knowledge activities age 11 absolutely evidence supposedly religious nature as grahams troubled childhood basis assertion 15 lines testimony grandmother there evidence graham mistreated way child absolutely showing event childhood contributed make extremely violent person become age 17 in addition graham misconstrues record voir dire examination trial while judge counsel state graham offered varying definitions word deliberately trial court fact define word venir members reduce states burden proof the record shows trial court repeatedly advised venir members term would defined trial use common sense interpretation word deliberately means answering first special issue to support statement i would refer court joint appendix pages 90 169 205 291 353 419 finally grahams assertion trial courts definition term criminal acts violence somehow reduced states burden proof second special issue likewise reputed record the examples offered trial court relatively minor offenses included broad definition term also referred robbery rape murder again term deliberately trial court told venir members criminal acts violence would defined trial term deliberately jurors would use common sense interpretation not grahams claim factually lacking also untenable matter law jurek in jurek court upheld constitutionality statute issue precisely allows jury consider whatever evidence mitigating circumstances defense bring the jurek court believe special issues narrow foreclose consideration mitigating evidence instead found got focus jurys consideration circumstances individual offender offense jurek controls grahams claim there defendant young person time offense both texas court criminal appeals fifth circuit held youth includes defendants age 23 time offense graham acknowledges must jurek jury could give mitigating effect youth answering second special issue claims relevance outside scope texas statutory scheme as court appeals observed though say youth cannot considered special issues necessarily say evidence defendant ascribes mitigating value cannot considered my response your honor examination trial record reveals youth offered one purpose show graham would future danger although graham introduced evidence age time offense tried 5 months offense jury able observe apparent age time trial in addition defense counsel stated without objection graham 17 time offense defense counsel argued youth graham im essentially paraphrasing closing argument redeeming value could rehabilitated would change would slow life spared the record devoid suggestion graham wished youth considered purpose trial the trial court requested give supplemental instruction graham claims entitled perhaps damaging graham rather whatever aggravating quality might attached youth fact state proved demonstrably violent person evidenced number extraneous offenses introduced punishment phase trial the state recited brief proved number robberies rapes committed graham 1week period in addition offered testimony juvenile probation officer grahams reputation peaceful lawabiding citizen bad her evidence testimony obviously supports inference prior 1 week may 1981 model citizen if however your honor accept definition youth given court criminal appeals fifth circuit consider going way 23 case falls apart a 23yearold defendant cannot make argument graham indeed 17yearold defendant obtains reversal conviction retried age 24 cannot make argument although graham acknowledges under statute your honor your honor i 360 pending cases i know many trials argument made 360 inmates death row texas convicted old statute although graham concedes must jurek remains your honor i aware that done i dont think done well your honor your honor what im saying court criminal appeals required i know least cases i dont want misspeak i know small number trial court gave instructions requested even though state appellate authority it became effective september 1st 1991 although graham concedes must jurek remains good law yes your honor your honor im sure i know case i think it excusing defendants failure raise issue trial in words excusing procedural default i defer mr tigar tells regard as i saying graham concedes must jurek remains good law yet asks court interpret penry manner cant squared jurek as court appeals observed grahams interpretation penry broad requires jurek overruled viewed light claim failed new rule would barred teague v lane alternative penry interpreted graham urges abrogate jurek penry wrongly decided overruled the court need go far however they decide case simply fifth circuit attempting reconcile two lines capital sentencing precedent clarifying holding penry as court noted many times explaining operations texas statute reconfirming validity jurek texas narrows class death eligibles guilt phase statutory elements capital murder no your honor yes your honor im saying yes your honor point im making present culpability culpability crime taken account jury two different stages trial 1 finding guilty capital murder found eligible death penalty second time first special issue whether committed crime deliberately no your honor the texas court criminal appeals said deliberately linguistic equivalent intentionally deliberately state mind embraces engage conduct it mental process activates intentional act yes your honor also something necessarily considered issue 2 jury knows told grahams counsel trial remain youth forever he change he slow yes your honor well your honor im sure if your honor understood i apologize what i saying present culpability determined guilt stage statute course youth legal excuse committing capital murder something argued first special issue that deliberateness your honor would urge court appeals case noble attempt reconcile courts two lines cases i really add nothing beyond no your honor i believe court appeals said special issues allow special issues particularly future dangerousness issue allow jury consider youth mitigating factor position first special issue also im sure theyd rest terms your honor posed what say i would argue strenuously court showing youth mitigating purpose offered trial regard future dangerousness issue regard wed rely boyde court observed mitigating value evidence determined purpose offered they your honor position first issue raises yes your honor i dont wish beat much first issue focuses present culpability second future dangerousness that correct your honor no your honor the way well your honor quite frankly im sure i understand nuances mens i understand court criminal appeals held deliberateness falls somewhere premeditation intent involves mental process simply intent act less deliberated premeditation exactly your honor yes your honor yes your honor i would site firens v state its 1981 case 620 southwest 2d 577 620 620 your honor 577 southwest 2d yes your honor i think much gleaned grahams brief case lists qualities youth deemed mitigating among impulsiveness inability think rationally maturely acting obviously deliberate going converse impulsive quality youth impulsiveness obviously deliberateness inquiry encompass as i saying moments ago class narrowed guilt phase punishment phase state bears burden proof beyond reasonable doubt special issues we know walton v arizona permissible defendant prove mitigation preponderance texas affords defendants capital defendants much protection regard requiring state prove issues beyond reasonable doubt the defendant allowed introduce whatever evidence wishes mitigation jury normally instructed grahams case page 10 joint appendix consider evidence presented not instruction limiting jurys consideration evidence fact instructed consider evidence introduced phases trial penry simply held believe supplemental instructions required case allow jury give effect mental retardation childhood abuse mitigating factors holding followed recognition although penrys evidence mitigating quality essentially aggravating future dangerousness inquiry that true your honor i suppose extent penrys evidence cannot considered within first special issue either that jury able give full mitigating effect evidence within first special issue well second no your honor accept perhaps chronological age relevance outside inquiries posed two special issues first two no no your honor accept thats relevant consideration far mitigating evidence goes its simply position special issues allow consideration regard whether acted deliberately future actions second issue yes your honor well i would defer court appeals said penry suffered uniquely severe permanent handicap that standard fifth circuit enunciated capital defendant must satisfy prevail penry claim im sorry your honor i cant give answer i i would say your honor no your honor tried sentenced 5 months oh 5 months now primary position forgive articulating poorly first special issue focuses present culpability second special issue allows jury give mitigating effect youth capacity rehabilitation capacity rehabilitation equally valid sense concern personal culpability graham also argues prosecutor argued youth basis sentence death the record support assertion the argument contained page 480 joint appendix simply stressed graham demonstrably violent person past actions probative future behavior the prosecutor argue even remotely suggest graham deserved die young finally your honors closing i would like respond i would consider rather curious assertion act texas legislature amending statute somehow lends validity grahams claim as initial matter i would note incorrect graham asserts footnote 11 reply brief office attorney general drafted sponsored new statute in fact statute passed one drafted supported office that matter aside hardly doubted legislature acted prudently responding penry courts concerns amending statute necessarily broadly enough encompass class penry excludables their action however taken concession validity 360 remaining convictions i think assertion perhaps supported fact 21 executions taken place since penry old statute in closing your honors i would like emphasize scope decision case far exceeds mere youth we seeing since penry decided weve seen number claims capital defendants constitutes mitigating evidence included fact defendant sociopath condition court found aggravating smith v estelle yes your honor james demouchette last prisoner executed texas execution took place last month precisely submission sociopath that explained actions could control therefore mitigating rule penry weve also told things hispanic petitioner claimed part hispanic culture smoke marijuana get fights evidence presented trial mitigating weve weve seen claims defendants brought claim hate particular racial group therefore acts violence committed members group mitigating again claims bizarre may seem fit within language henry explain defendants actions show burdened condition control if court questions concludes remarks,466.0,572,24,could speak little bit mr palmer i think us may hard time hearing are going get someone else speak are going get specific argument case sufficiently young purposes second question future dangerousness jurors considered youth likely response would young even conviction hes still going remain young going quite time outgrows impulsiveness violence whatever case may therefore considering youth really must considered aggravating factor rather mitigating one result unless special penry kind circuitbreaker would way consider youth mitigating factor what response argument counsel many cases death sentence pending texas that fall old statute argument made youth factor 360 old statute did texas courts old statute perhaps penry case grant supplemental instructions cases mr tigar represented us court criminal appeals said retreat i wasnt sure prepenry postpenry what date new statute 91 may i ask timing your opponent cited black v state i havent read what significance case time sequence its 1991 case i think but i take position youth mitigating factor sense reduces culpability offender committed offense yes culpability crime thats committed mitigating factor second question jury answer reflect it goes future dangerousness well deliberately means intentionally so extent claimed youth compared adult really full control may considered issue 1 i understand i understand that future how youth enter determination guilt initially way find requisite intent existed thats duplicated i thought youd indicated youth taken account deciding whether hes guilty begin guilty murder so youre back special issues you indicated penry could clarified do suggestion formulation clarify penry well think court appeals dealt youth terms culpability i thought said long youth could considered factor future dangerousness far well court appeals expressly deal notion youth mitigating factor sense less culpability committing crime hes committed did court appeals talk saying dont need dont need special instruction but opinions court perhaps i havent joined really refer culpability dont and plenty support cases youth factor fairly considered terms culpability yes right mr palmer im sure i understand youth considered first question as premise asking may i ask go back moment something i think i recall saying commenting manner texas courts defined deliberateness said didnt simply equate intention if i remember said correctly said defined deliberateness deliberation process leads intentional act correct all right well follow that whenever intentional act committed must therefore deliberate act result deliberation then i dont think i understand so isnt merely element leading intentional act sense mental element addition intentionality and defined texas courts this i dont mean put spot could give cite case in construed im sorry 6 yes now premise would explain youth comes consideration deliberateness is sense young person thought less capable engaging kind deliberative process point but wasnt also true emphasis opinion lesser moral culpability mentally retarded person to extent i guess excuse suppose extent im trouble hearing but extent isnt case somewhat similar least case least justice whites questioning suggested youth may reduce moral culpability defendant oh take position reduce moral culpability defendant the chronological age mental age might that reduced moral culpability defendant relevance that special issues allow adequate consideration reduced moral culpability but wasnt satisfactory answer penry thats im clear i see relevance youre predicting future dangerousness im quite sure i understand seriously distinguished two cases moral culpability thank suppose 10 years goes 17yearold sentenced hes 27 years old future dangerousness take account youth time commission crime it 4 years case sentenced thats claimed mitigating fact persons sociopath thank mr palmer mr tigar 9 minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-20,-8,195.0,-223.0

decision relating conditions confinement metropolitan correctional center federally operated shortterm custodial facility new york city there five issues presented decision the first perhaps potentially significant standpoint constitutional doctrine involves constitutionality doublebunking pretrial detainees rooms designed single occupancy thats right there various classifications inmates kept facility like mcc addition persons held lieu bail awaiting trial criminal charges there significant group inmates  brought ad testificandum ad prosequendum writs appear federal court proceedings prisoners serving state federal sentences there persons awaiting parole probation revocation hearings sentenced inmates whose sentences short duration deemed desirable serve sentence new york thats correct as doublebunking issue thats correct case the group people talking connection doublebunking issue people unable secure release bail is difference facility i believe generally group people actually maybe categories kept west street shifted facilities mcc opened population increase people committed bureaus custody immigration deportation cases others i dont know record i simply dont know answer question well brought habeas corpus class action certified class action we challenged jurisdiction we contested wisdom certifying class action done challenged court well i focused attention preparing argument question i prepared dispute  not one i could state well i believe authority habeas corpus class actions questions come attention solicitor generals office connection whether challenged point sought challenge propriety dont case im sure thats correct im  well im generally familiar i refreshed i havent suggested court i dont think  i dont perceive kind threshold jurisdictional question must decide even though brought decision well i think would right im sure perhaps colleague answer there maybe alternative grounds mandamus – well i think answer asked court overturn judgment grounds lack jurisdiction grounds challenge propriety class action certification im reluctant state position government issues without giving greater deal thought well class consists total population inmates sentenced pretrial detainees i think that internal conflicts interest groups  request separate subclasses certified denied district court you whole population every issue the

much relief respondents sought denying others claims the court relied constitutional statutory grounds decision some rulings government acquiesced others appealed court appeals court appeals turn affirmed part reversed part it rejected statutory basis district courts orders prohibiting various mcc practices conditions finding case generally involved matters committed agency discretion law accordingly rested ruling solely constitutional grounds and ive said setting forth constitutional standards distinguish sentenced inmates pretrial detainees as former challenged conditions judged eighth amendment cruel unusual punishment standard detainees  court relied presumption innocence set much higher standard it stated pretrial detainees maybe subject “only restrictions privations inhere confinement justified compelling necessities jail administration” and made quite clear challenges conditions confinement detainees adjudicated without consideration either physical administrative justifications particular practice it applied standards doublebunking issue affect adopting per se rule two inmates may housed room designed one with regard issues court court appeals acknowledged maintenance security order compelling necessity jail administration nevertheless concluded government failed establish sufficient justification practices rules question now i indicated beginning case breaks two different types issues the first involves standards due process rights pretrial detainees evaluated context challenged alleged overcrowding mcc the second involves security related issues now since first issue potentially novel substantial constitutional issue i intend devote limited time question rely briefs issues id like say brief word mcc getting legal arguments it one limited number federal facilities specifically designed house pretrial detainees shortterm inmates as court appeals described mcc represented architectural embodiment best progressive penological planning the key design element mcc thats relevant doublebunking issue indeed central element facility modular unit concept in concept self contained residential units lieu traditional cell block typical unit contains 48 rooms would join large multipurpose rooms facilities recreation education exercise dining the common areas carpeted sleeping rooms doors rather bars virtually entire day except seven sleeping hours 11 night 6 morning inmates free move unit without restriction also visiting facilities attached units rather central facility institution i understand slides record photographs institution deem useful get look like the mcc designed house 449 inmates however contemporaneous opening august 1975 sharp unexpected increase number persons committed bureau prisoners custody bureau determined be housed mcc because number inmates exceeded designed capacity institution bureau determined order meet custodial obligations number rooms used house two inmates bunk bed replace single beds dormitory areas accordingly bunk beds installed place single beds 73 389 residential rooms mcc now respondents invoked court appeals relied upon due process clause striking double bunking case the focus issue therefore concerns substantive content clause the court appeals held due process clause force without aid constitutional provision confers upon pretrial detainees right free cramped housing conditions absence governmental showing compelling necessity i believe viewed liberty interest dispute case pretrial detainees retain liberty interests inconsistent fact confinement we simply dispute standard applied court appeals evaluating practices arguably impinged upon liberty interests right standard now think court appeals standard lacks basis constitutional decisions court dealing subject substantive due process think proper resolution issue court appeals required government afforded opportunity adduce factors brought challenged conditions propriety governments action assessed reasonableness relation legitimate governmental objectives stake now two aspects constitutional backdrop issue worth highlighting first dispute conditions confinement pretrial detainees sentenced inmates must meet minimum levels decency regard consideration housing food sanitation medical care spelled brief reasons contention standards fully satisfied mcc constitutionally and pretrial detainees due process clause well it sense i think conditions kind viewed cruel unusual punishment eighth amendment we agreement pretrial detainees cannot due process clause punished prior trial well conviction see  they cant punished thats correct thats true yes agree if concluded punishment would violate due process clause now great deal difficulty respondents argument involved case demonstrated punishment we think concept punishment theyre using trivial totalogical concept its punishment repeatedly say punishment  why i call incarceration well punishment custody it incarceration course punishment well thats thats case due process clause allows punishment extent pretrial  but i think getting circularity i dont think substantial dispute no one questioning validity institution pretrial detention well detention involves impairment fundamental liberty interest protected due process clause standard court appeals applied doublebunking clearly inappropriate standard apply pretrial commitment indeed the constitution statutes require kind least restrictive alternative test detention last step youve excluded reasonable measure assure presence trial that purpose theyre  thats true i assume i assume  well i dont think  i dont think thats right amount bail set amount necessary assure appearance trial dont post amount follows determination lesser amount personal recognizance bond appearance trial cannot assured thats reason  thats correct would deterred fleeing failing appear  i think  i believe weve citied section 3146 i think brief terms  there consider  considerations number alternatives money bail low list well dont  i agree i sure bearing  i dont know bearing context case one contesting validity institutional pretrial detention no one contesting  contesting compelling necessity standard appropriate respondents contesting people detained its subsidiary conditions confinement incidental massive restriction liberty thats involved detention issue well let explain role i think punishment properly plays when challenge presented condition confinement government obliged assuming challenge crosses constitutional threshold presenting kind claim liberty interest government obliged show fashion standard justification action taken impaired interest now  case pretrial detainee government cannot say one reasons punish one reasons justifies practice rehabilitate deter others committing offense those  governmental objectives invoked support condition confinement case convicted inmates in case pretrial detainees must kinds considerations invoked our concern case real substantial physical administrative considerations made necessary resort degree doublebunking totally foreclosed consideration court standard effect said per se “you cant put two people room designed one we dont want hear youre it” now connection lot suggestion physical considerations administrative convenience insubstantial excuses government makes justify practices something  administrative convenience something like work overtime make modifications establish routines think administrate convenience much context the bureau prisons certain population inmates committed custody it control number inmates it house the kinds considerations administrative convenience included this concept involve going put people if cant doublebunk mcc number people perhaps new york city including didnt happen case could pretrial detainees moved way family friends away lawyers  no could kind issue would explored trial simply administrative convenience administrators encompassed within rubric welfare people committed custody group mcc told cant doublebunk anymore happened 90 inmates bureau prisons judged ought housed mcc sent facilities possibly crowded reasons less suitable now i want i think save balance time rebuttal i may thank mr chief justice first regard testimony government experts cases amount space thats necessary case case involved cell people locked substantial portions day the central concept mcc repeating people locked rooms except sleeping hours so inconveniences talking case two people cramped quarters dont deny quarters cramped inconvenience terms forced togetherness exist period relatively brief period fact none essentially none waking hours except certain times everybody go rooms cell count now hearing case hear governments justifications resorting doublebunking also hearing examine effect doublebunking inmates the evidence district court case affidavit government psychiatrist examined facility concluded substantial evidence emotionally detrimental conditions existed mcc now response part district court court appeals large part already settled another case the case already settled court appeals made revealing error original opinion page 18 a appendix stated “inmate testimony revealed double celling produced numerous disagreements choice activities within room spawned fights charges theft frequent involuntary contact” testimony later amended opinion another case the case case 40 square feet two inmates instead 76 77 case the case case inmates locked room approximately twice time case the case conventional cell block kind jail a summary judgment granted us we submitted affidavits the district court went jail visited said as people known say obscenity unconstitutional i know i see this consider unsatisfactory way dealing issue i would like point get back question punishment one thing thats important ask inquiring physical administrative reasons doublebunking nobody lower courts based decision grounds happened punishment basis decision that argument respondents effort surmount lack authority support court appeals conclusion compelling necessity standard appropriate judge restriction liberty inmates involved the court appeals say punishment now say punishment analyze concept way court analyzed look standards mendozamartinez suggest go inquiry determining whether something punishment and think apply inquiry case would conclude happened punishment so i come back point your honor  well argument unless finding lack reasonable relationship whatever level judicial scrutiny might given governments justification practice doublebunking government – legitimate governmental objectives might support practice practice stands – we think could dont think concept punishment useful role play analyzing due process plan right well depends upon view take the view taken moore case i believe perhaps places one specific category interest fundamental subjected searching scrutiny punishment would  well i understood moore case suggest five votes court least proposition due process concept rational continuum justice harlans words include series points picked in view course doesnt matter disposition case we entitled hearing show reasons explore effects conditions i agree punishment would defendants thats correct yes well yes grounds due process clause there two separate ways however look due process analysis one importation eighth amendment standard due process clause second view independently liberty interest subjected crowding  well court  the court has i think courts approached concept pragmatic way theyre prepared say conditions confinement fall minimal standards decency constitute punishment well case might different court appeals made per say probation turned upon design quality aspect case it designed one person said cannot two people room designed one we would defend course we might court appeals point i trying say thats correct were asking – thats correct well  we explained court able comply outstanding injunction number pretrial detainees present dramatically lower two years ago we still take position population institution present fluctuating near 449 people present capacity  its designed 449 the present capacity terms numbers beds hired 30 extra beds dormitory actually 479 could held in fact practical matter cant always classifications unit women male prisoners put unit might 10 empty beds simply cant use kinds problems like but position injunction issued us believe improper unauthorized without constitutional basis would need arose may resort doublebunking  well i dont know i dont  would object disposition involved lets say i dismissal writ i dont know would object disposition vacating injunction remanding we think  i think united states v w t grant case indicates would moot say injunction prohibited i dont know district court gets back reverse whether meaningful controversy i dont know district court going decide whether doublebunking justified time  doesnt exist it may important question my understanding i made inquiry i advised court appeals authority affect habeas corpus class action   none i simply  i think important question i dont think important question case didnt raise well perhaps would important question might raised i dont mean facetious i clear court presently decision  well distinction kind subject matter jurisdiction habeas corpus claim question whether class action improperly certified we another  well would prepared court wants us research question submit views now suggesting we suggesting requesting relief except regards  we raised petition well way weve – time brief policy already changed briefing intended focus well i think hardcover books involved injunction issued soft cover books i think moot as i saying earlier intention  i guess i sure would draw matter something,645.0,829,60,well hear arguments next bell wolfish mr frey i think may proceed ready mr frey say pretrial detainees i take excluding confined status pretrial detainees well categories people people convicted sentenced confinement and since court appeals second circuit find way cruel unusual punishment appeal taken people case arent as doublebunking business now people remain awaiting trial definition able secure release bail wouldnt inaudible i know new group people are people held  either allowed put bail couldnt indicted felonies people charged misdemeanors mr frey get argument state facility cause action would brought 1983 i would suppose have given thought whats source cause action thats asserted case i know thats really responsibility im interested  you agree issues properly raisable habeas corpus proceeding it struck somewhat anomalous i trying think i didnt know government position like is history class habeas corpus class action youre familiar a basic question didnt preiser case hold challenged conditions confinement contrast fact confinement habeas corpus inappropriate that habeas corpus appropriate secure release words youre generally familiar voice overlap well middendorf henry october term 1975 i think opinion court expressly reserved prior  question whether habeas corpus action could class action i dont think court ever approved well class action one thing basic availability habeas corpus fundamental thats jurisdictional isnt voice overlap want lawsuit otherwise inaudible the question i thought brother agree habeas conditions well one way would rule  did say percentage total population represented class inaudible i see so whole population and issues concern whole  was liberty interest property interest do say disputes must mean constitutionally because cruel unusual punishment cruel unusual punishment clause whats due process whats voice overlap isnt but said pretrial detainees thats not could usually punished cant punished and matter due process said that standard suggest one conclude particular type treatment really classified punishment would violate due process clause didnt cruel unusual long  what call incarceration if punishment but inevitably punishment could pretrial detainees it doesnt allow punishment anybody convicted criminal offense if punishment thing pretrial detainee everybody released so doesnt right detain depend finding people found likely show trials upon furnishing bail therefore detain order assure presence trial but youve met tests youre depriving liberty simply order assure presence trial  but mr frey people least would released could raised bail youre keeping people wouldnt show theyre supposed show youre keeping even though would show couldnt afford  but whatever amount had theyve able raise would released its said  applicable statutes bail but doesnt finding alternatives besides bail wouldnt  well isnt  said really doesnt cover kind determination thats made you arrive  arrive conclusion alternatives werent suffice  but purpose detention must bearing standard review if punishment one thing if simply assuring show trial way assure appearance may another you move state facility new york theyre  mr frey government denied right put testimony its submission unless theres finding amounts punishment due process clause implicated in words dont accept series suggested question do think violated due process clause even punishment voice overlap then due process clause implicated obviously i think everybody would agree government cannot punish somebody unless hes convicted criminal offense beyond reasonable doubt therefore cant take pretrial detainee put anything else thats obviously punishment now would clearly implicate due process clause case fifth amendment absent finding punishment due process clause involved voice overlap constitution order find answer constitutional question look constitution dont well punishment reasons world wouldnt make constitutional would show good reasons whip people day then wouldnt voice overlap constitutionally inaudible cells six  ten square feet two people room two chairs kept 24 hours day would think could enjoined  on grounds due process clause but involves punishment doesnt eighth amendment that means punishment let get one thing straight i take – youd making argument facility deserve way used it would know perhaps isnt relevant isnt crucial planned hold x number sudden whole 2x well question still designed way used would still defending won court appeals mr fery respect publisheronly rule indicate briefs i remember government changed practice policy theres longer enforced rule respect paperback books and therefore extent youre – planning asking court appeals judgment disturbed aspect now general change conditions overcrowding facility isnt  dont represent us overcrowding but youre still complaining its designed 449 so would vigorously object suggestion case moot when doesnt exist do i understand government concedes taking position question writ habeas corpus subject class action important question none  dont think thats important question case but theres jurisdiction court whether anyone raised but one deserves exploration would agree no well pass later well resume  excuse well resume arguments 1 oclock subject mr justice whites question now yes wont back 1 oclock well i might youre asking mr frey think issue books moot youre suggesting what suggesting where put – raised question petition and youve briefed so mean issue become moot since filing petition certiorari and injunction would vacated extent thank the case submitted,1274.0,1825,21,mr chief justice thank your honor mr chief justice may please court the governments application compelling interest test appropriate standard determining rights pretrial detainees ignores historically legal context standard indeed facts case furthermore government misconstrues second circuits test what dealing fundamental right pretrial detainee punished this right persists even though pretrial detainee placed custody assure appearance court time trial this fact detention constitutionally considered punishment eighth amendment permits bail inference permits custody lieu bail order assure appearance defendant trial doublebunking district judge saw found incentive punishment necessary order assure appearance defendant trial security institution two factors considered determining whether condition confinement beyond fact incarceration punishment well look particular  are talking normal military condition yes your honor theres vast distinction governmental purpose military context governmental purpose oh no your honor indeed we saying overcrowding part caused doublebunking case  no well would overcrowding doublebunking the government never indicated facts case inability comply district courts order they compliance two years without single request stay without returning court relief order prohibiting double bunking okay defined purposes case district court saw made findings two people housing cell judge found built one the results housing two people cell built one small space movement two people he looked saw narrow aisle secondly requires urination defecation close presence person resulting discomforts judge described opinion well i think i think your honor point easily explained the governments compelling interest wartime far different governments compelling interest exists detention presumptively innocent detainees the purpose war time confinement create fighting unit could defend government could defend country indeed your honor conditions confinement military camp even normal times justified government governments need create unified fighting force capable taking orders directions indeed wartime conditions leaving severe restrictions conditions thats true the governments compelling interest limited making sure individual shows court protecting security institution government claim indeed never overcrowding doublebunking case justified anything cost convenience no thats the connection case your honor conditions imposed resulted severe loss privacy dignity judge found specific facts case yes admittedly limitations yes limitations thats per se case thats every case  that might well true your honor imposed condition condition imposed government also free atmosphere individual would free pick go go one street take bus go museum library yes concede saying confined small space we go  judgment looking single cells exposed toilet excretory functions performed presence another use bunk bed one wall causes cold air blow persons sleeping top bunk freedom movement restricted shifted bunk bed opposite wall one end bed would blocking window they put blanket judge found result result ventilation system functioning properly so  well urging spa urging conditions facts individuals deprived judge found minimal privacy dignity court appeals agrees excuse your honor no yes would except lived room like slept top bunk would unable move slept bottom bunk bunk bed room  because airdent let cold air right across top inmates body top bunk bed movement restricted couldnt lift legs couldnt turn couldnt prop wall body  no way would your honor well  it would couldnt move room well free leave room yes would judge found couldnt move around room regardless size no meant desk two chairs second chair put second person bunk bed room aisle narrow move around couldnt leave others company way forced remain together time within one inches within inches use toilet facility bed placed wall vent would placed opposite wall  not per se but private toilet private existed case room person using toilet remove – distance except several inches perhaps  that your honor  the record case disputes the government filed several sets affidavits i believe government contesting case given opportunity present cost justification cost inconvenience justifications as matter law fundamental right punished infringed upon  conditions confinement cost inconvenience simply legally irrelevant even governments enhanced scrutiny test caused inconvenience cannot sole fact the  question doesnt come government never asserted new facility  the governments never asserted need one here appeal district court government right but didnt say the court said functional unit system used bureau prisons institution inmates could institutions could service population excess population institution built 449 no doesnt require new institution not record indication the court appeals found government handled simply removing institution inmates serving sentences kept institutions part workforce governments convenience well government compliance courts full order overcrowding since august 28 1978 and never returned court proof assertions facts would indicate incapable maintaining fact conceded briefs capable maintaining  as far i understand  well government says relieved obligations situation may come they longer keeping custody  well i think your honor due respect ask government whether statement brief intent overcrowded  exactly your honor point is government didnt seek stay doubleselling overcrowding doubleselling order never there two factors involved first never returned district court claiming impossibility construct new institution substantial change facts requires relieved obligations order yes yes thats correct government position leaves open say need say they lot prisoners would put institution convicted nonconvicted pre trail whatever may the fact  no im pushing moot attempt laughter im urging your honor im urging your honor situation government claims capable repetition urging order proper assertion to return question governments compliance district court included order provision would permit warden institution certify needed overcrowd emergency immediate severe overcrowding the government never availed portion order it doesnt go court it file copy certification court its position even though order effect the prohibition overcrowding effect while case court havent used remedy no asserting case moot we saying factual assertion record governments justification caused inconvenience permit overcrowded housing existed facility time case tried that conditions justifications  well thats governments theory i dont understand  thats exactly point well with i move one additional issue laughter there decisions i dont head moment your honor florida california federal courts involving capital punishment sanction cases decided issues based upon class action status i believe your honor habeas corpus proceedings habeas corpus used courts second circuit for instance i cite saw sostre mcginnis release individual necessarily full custody conditions unconstitutional i say i believe cases i happy supply court one additional fact court considered crowding issue entire set functional unit system inmates spend virtually 23 hours every day one functional unit mr frey described court meant inmates confined area virtually activities now judge found institution couldnt supply activities multipurpose functional unit rooms supposed supply overcrowding resulted rate functioning institution i think would present difficult case well conditions room denial privacy cold air blowing vent presence exposed toilet would still exist well architects plan i would submit court could disregard architects plan though court could consider element deciding whether room appropriate housing one person thats correct indeed bureau prisons presented testimony cases would indicate 50 square feet minimum required per inmate cell order give adequate movement space adequate psychological space that testimony cited campbell mcgruder dc circuit the draft standards proposed justice department indicate space provided per inmate doublecelling overcrowded situation inadequate i dont think absorbed constitution i suggest court valid evidence considered expert evidence case government drafted standards correctional officials would indicate believe adequate i think evidence district court considered appropriate consider making evaluation its ways medical case doctors assertions constitutional principles valid evidence determining proper legal standard apply no sir objection record doesnt present case they 75 square feet its  yes supplement appendix voice overlap excuse your honor thats rightlaughter approximately 10 x 75laughter yeah well i think good authority laughter now room toilet juts 2 feet center room  im sorry

Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services","Beaty Mae Gilliard, et al.",6.0,3.0,1,1157.0,1658,33,mr chief justice may please court the question involves validity amendment afdc program congress enacted 1984 provision i shall refer standard filing unit provision this amendment one many budget cutting steps congress took year designed close congress viewed loophole afdc eligibility scheme under prior law family applying afdc could try maximize afdc grant excluding filing unit certain family members typically children sources income social security benefits child support accountable earnings employment this enabled family get maximum afdc grant members unit plus keep income members left unit in 1984 congress decided eliminate benefit maximizing option enacting provision challenged it requires family applies afdc members family live together must included filing unit income family members must added figure needy family public assistance congress based amendment belief family members live near poverty level live together tend share income expenses therefore reliable index familys need public assistance total income family members thus rather simply cutting afdc families across board congress sought target benefit cuts 1984 families members separate income less needy now appellees course constitutional right permanently fixed level afdc benefits therefore recognize could bring constitutional challenge decision congress simply cut benefit levels without what argue therefore congress really cut afdc benefits rather took property away children required newly included filing unit appellees focus child support income especially assignment provision enacted 1975 requires mother applies afdc assign state right support child may this provision designed improve collection delinquent child support transferring burden collection abandoned mother state greater enforcement resources now assignment provision works hardship family every dollar support assigned state one dollar afdc comes back family moreover family assigns child support also receives extra 50 month state virtue child support disregard provision thats right thats right thats appellees theory effect assignment provision take property child transmute afdc give whole family why theory wrong well think theory taking theory wrong several reasons first premise theory she could she required spend money best interests children could decide i think afdc program also imposes obligations mothers respect spend it could joey thinks needy children i dont think would it would depend children needed i mean way mother spends afdc money with probability money 200 would going pay things common expenses like rent utilities gas light i cant say would absolutely violate afdc law i dont think clear it depends family situation it clear use money could violate afdc reasons governing duties custodial parent and i dont think say without knowing facts case no would come back family plus 50 extra the 200 comes family different form it doesnt come qua child support comes qua afdc benefits but get 200 different source plus state actually collects child support get 50 so bottom line 250 although comes different place rather 200 got child support thats correct but course parent doesnt pay assignment family would gotten nothing whatsoever if parent doesnt pay least get 200 afdc benefit virtue assignment it would 200 thats correct the childs pro rata share thats right if look well raises question state law and first reason thats correct the fathers obligation pay support runs child amount pays determined childs need ability pay wealth we think thats correct thats side contends if mother obligation pay well benefit child different giving cash and state law clearly permits mother assign child support order get afdc entire family so clear state law permit mother best interests child support assign support money state it require fact thats right well would well raises question support paid the afdc statute permits states either include exclude inkind payments income purposes afdc eligibility now father support decree said father would pay dentist bills would rather pay money mother pay bills would treated i think north carolina inkind payment wouldnt count well let cocounsel respond i dont know north carolina cases but i believe north carolina exercised option count inkind payments income so key thing north carolina law whether money comes cash mother use discretion if it comes kind paid third party parent would count income i dont believe would i think would depend judge keyed money if keyed i think something quasioptional cosmetic thing like probably could prefer one child another mother could deciding kid going braces i think mother always option deciding going allocate fixed small fixed pot money but beyond afdc i dont believe would orthodontics but beyond it would depend need if kind critical lifethreatening need would different judgment i dont think theres rule treat absolutely equally there theres range reasonableness no the whole point let mother act like mother mother decide best use money children and beyond afdc also medicaid assistance available i think probably could i think would real hard justify but case orthodonture id like point medicaid available children filing unit automatically thats one benefit child receives virtue assignment qualifies medicaid immediately could well cover medical expenses let get back constitution there kind constitutional problem statute cannot declared invalid and i point first problem sides theory state law child really absolute property right child support what right money used best interest state law permits indeed requires assignment support get afdc family and state law therefore contemplates childs best interest support money assigned get afdc family its possible but would follow decision congress include kind wouldnt supporting kind income child determining need family if child earned money working macdonalds lived family money would included family income might better live father included but i think inevitable familybased grant afdc youve got look income people live family see needy family and could that would give incentive economic incentive people live another way but thats inevitable consequence family grant provision congress set the second reason think taking theory doesnt work participation afdc program entirely voluntary if mother want assign child support need take part afdc program it simply one many conditions eligibility getting public benefits the congress made family unit applicant but child doesnt want support assigned tell mother cannot assign support i mean children depend monetarily depend mother make decisions best interest we think state law couldnt get injunction childs absolute property the mother use best interest convince i think ultimately no doesnt follow you first well first theres got property taken okay beyond consider going program entirely voluntary begin but child wrong mother best interest well youre right could enjoined going program well would taking werent program well point really property right if really property state law permits assign hard see well i dont well child property describe well thats first problem argument but problems beyond showed brief mr chief justice may please court the state north carolina administers afdc program conformity federal law explained solicitor general stated briefs appellant i would like make two points court first district court found unconstitutional taking based upon erroneous interpretarion north carolina law regarding child support secondly court committed fundamental error ordering retroactive benefits case no i dont believe taking case voluntary decision eligibility requirement you dont really get taking property its voluntary decision mothers part in judge mcmillan found children lived together must apply afdc family unit therefore law assignment must assignment child support rights he found certain property interests taken but property interest of child the property interest explained opinion child support exclusive property right north carolina the right i could glean opinion says child absolute exclusive right enforce obligation custodial parent case im going use mother thats little easier enforce what i would like show is erroneous interpretation it correct you unless i would think court would accept interpretation state law clearly shown incorrect i would like show today they attempt exact opposite the second property right judge mcmillan found taken described exclusive right child enforce obligation parent spend child support money child what simply law north carolina what statutes read child support ordered primary obligation placed upon mother father child support ordered meet reasonable needs child then child support paid custodial parent benefit child in north carolina child right enforce obligation mother use child support benefit north carolina statute passed passed law deems assignment child support rights obligation receive support upon acceptance public assistance this statute enacted north carolina the rationale judge mcmillan it considered legislature north carolina courts north carolina considered passed upon statute and i would say area family law north carolina the rationale the court ignored it mentioned opinion it raised pardon this raised court the briefs record docket sent page 32 appellees memorandum motion relief this filed may 30th 1985 this statute provision contained chapter 110 north carolina general statutes this brought courts attention in order reach opinion exclusive property right ignore statute you read north carolina child support law conjunction statutes these statutes read together judge mcmillans rationale there statute north carolina says child support exclusive property right child north carolina law places primary emphasis obligation parent support child that right child enforce obligation reading statutes child right and didnt would mother spending money benefit child this another fundamental error judge mcmillans opinion she breaking case breaking fiduciary child leaving child and income in hypothetical income coming family 250 child support one child in case mother would within mothers discretion easy decisions would within mothers discretion determine best interest child she receives child support statutes the statute read child support shall received spent benefit child child support received custodial parent used minor childs benefit it would decision would within discretion mother the answer yes within discretion determines that would best benefit child that fundamental problem judge mcmillans analysis case undermining well established law north carolina custodial parent great flexibility determining best interest a parent may profit expense child if determined case action may brought childs behalf order compel mother act best interest then choice participation afdc program voluntary decision this within discretion mother if decides childs best interest whatever reason decides johnny every bit money matter voluntary decision make participate this decision make it hard decision i saying decisions easy decisions but decisions within discretion parent authorized north carolina law you able make entire argument the court wont rise lunch case submitted,720.0,984,50,we hear arguments next two consolidated cases no 86509 bowen gilliard no 86564 flaherty gilliard mr flauber may proceed whenever youre ready well comes back family say works hardship works hardship family but one contentions work hardship child support destined and give family thats right now wrong xxx taking lets get refinement takings is substance happens wrong under can mother receives afdc theory distribute among children anyway wants could continue give lets say gets 250 support payment joey could get 300 afdc decide im going spend 200 joey shes required spend best interest children but shes giving 200 joey thinks thats best interest children it assuredly isnt she wished could spread among children but figures 200 joeys no thats reason in fact given druthers shed distribute evenly among i think mother would but figures getting 200 exhusband joey thats converted afdc payment going continue spend 200 joey even though view thats best interest children would violate afdc rules it would depend children needed so children needed continued give 200 joey would violate afdc i know take hypothetical thats case she gives 200 bucks joey it could it isnt clear without violating afdc law mr lauber tell us child support payment ordered one children family others amount lets say 200 month 200 month must assigned state would come back family would oh wasnt understanding i thought 50 came child support payment paid child support payment made i thought 50 never given back family unless parent ordered pay support fact paid support well get afdc benefits it may 200 and indeed amount money received attributed afdc child support payment made less 200 i mean look childs pro rata share substantially less 200 support ordered and whole basis fathers support obligation example would obligation child fathered well isnt correct state courts order child support ordering basis fathers obligation child fathered isnt state law case didnt mother obligation spend child support one child what to use child support thats given child spend child benefit child all right not permits it seems require but mr lauber could certainly situations local state judge awards child support theory example particular child needs orthodontic treatment orders child support amount cover and father felt obligated pay purpose now afdc law requires assigned state isnt available child shouldnt father able go back state court say look federal government done judge now reduce child support im paying going family johnny needed orthodontic treatment well i thought examples record north carolina brought charges fathers making inkind contributions diapers forth mr lauber may i follow justice oconnors example orthodontic special need one child support money designated supposing done kind reason judge fixed support amount amount and goes afdc comes back mother would violate afdc rules mother use money purpose intended judge words giving disproportionate share child support money paid well would depend need children it would depend need children say three children they orthodontic problem and theyd like spend money three money orthodontic problem child father providing money could mother without violating afdc rules prefer one three children source money even though three needs thats assumption three needs need one produced money and would violate afdc your answer would violate afdc law mr lauber well anything would anything maybe weve picked bad well three three critical lifethreatening needs source money support one could mother would afdc rule mother must treat needy children equally despite fact one produces money gathering answer justice stevens justice scalia earlier fairly elaborate afdc code mother shall distribute money various children mr lauber ill give easier question i think make even clearer it isnt three orthodontic need two need food gets back money afdc could use orthodontic purpose originally contributed husband instead buying food two well may individual examples isnt childs best interest though and certainly examples record burden arrangement great caused families split send children live someone else benefit childs support thats pretty heavy burden isnt but theyre arguing taken mother its taken child its voluntary part child the mother says im going chuck child support order get money family whole well thats nice doesnt say anything whether taking child so say suggest child guardian secured guardian ad litem talked uncle said mother giving away child support lets sue think could injunction signing they say mine my father giving mother breaching trust so case really turns state law and if thought that payment belonged child must taking all right what must yes well child say im involuntary i dont want part program im going law makes mother put i dont want mother thats part case what mean wrong how state law money doesnt want part program all right and taking all right say you say remedy injunction the guardian ad litem didnt come along six months afterwards so gets injunction wants back pay i mean wants get support back and taking theres taking i mean seems case there isnt case unless child property state law thank mr lauber we hear ms mclamb do disagree district courts courts construction north carolina prevail whats error whats error north carolina law of child will change interpretation judge made north carolina law we normally course accept interpretation lower federal court matters state law dont and opposition show us contrary maybe statute taking how court deal particular statute but raised court you argued presented court you think whatever property right child might modified statute couldnt come face statute which one prevails i mean read together well would mother breaking child support law received child support didnt spend child well mother took money spent another child another child thought needed but think receiving child support wasnt afdc received 250 month split three ways among three children no child support income and use benefit children yes the answer yes i suppose well mother believes isnt best interests child support paid children going starve death doesnt use money and starve death thank you ms mclamb ms wettach well hear now,1105.0,1424,22,mr chief justice may please court the actual palpable financial loss plaintiff children case quite apparent evidence the two daughters joyce miles example lost 95 every month child support similar amounts money lost every month children case i think would helpful walked example practice actually works north carolina time for example joyce miles five children two oldest two different father the three younger ones separate fathers the two oldest girls beneficiaries 189 month child support payment it ordered state court judge made decision reasonable needs children ordered father pay prior 1984 rule imposed mother receive afdc assistance children separated grant she three younger fortunate father chose support received 244 afdc children in october 1984 received letter state department human resources said order continue receiving afdc children getting must add children grant part must make support available state the state take money keep money return 50 50 disregard well give afdc benefits she 189 support two older girls 244 three 95 apiece well cases amounts money significantly different in case said difference 80 95 lot evidence case spending money children recipients child support she mentioned two teenage girls tended spend money and we dont think theres evidence show mothers routinely violating court award she court order it tells shes got spend money certain way and theres evidence nationwide mothers im aware suit mother actually sued actually i would like take back there case district court found much law north carolina father sued mother misusing child support spending court said actually dismissed case father wrong party said child support money belongs children the father could bring suit next friend and implicitly authorized father able sue reason substantial misuse money mother i think would cognizable state law trust theory yes we feel we feel we feel reason court depart lower courts analysis north carolina law well theres certainly theres case law theres case law judge mcmillan course relied theres also statutes for benefit child particularly difficult concept if assignment no i dont think i think when participation program visavis child receiving child support voluntary mother certainly make choice child support getting inadequate meet needs therefore would like apply afdc condition eligibility make assignment state take responsibility collecting support but involuntariness becomes part changes assignment provision works i think thats incorrect when mother whole provision state law written voluntary matter apply afdc she forced apply afdc particular children as condition getting afdc children forced apply children its right right shes course nobody rounding telling apply judge mcmillan talked length assignment provision procedural mechanism state he certainly well course assignment law state law doesnt say deemed benefit child the assignment provision simply says apply afdc deemed made assignment child support state thats said it doesnt say anything benefit children transforming income benefit one i dont see would sense when assign money allowing state take it gives back grant make decision use assignment provision almost trade you trade child support 50 50 isnt adequate meet childs needs get 100 afdc back but figures different say assign 100 get 50 back thats different sort situation different sort choice they got 280 afdc 50 support net loss 95 so thats loss and course afdc hasnt gone done child support if look whole family total family unit mathematics work way of course position constitutional rights belong children money paid it depends whose 189 i think would look state law says type income my recollection earned income common law owned parents discretion i think depends matter state law nature 189 now i think different case mother receives fiduciary trust capacity well wouldnt case that would case front court again i think would look nature income youre talking if fact happening money taken child obligation support children i think would precisely legal situation if money restricted way not shes losing anything child it keeps first 50 thats correct thats difficult example counted afdc purposes anyway if it best interests child coming say every six months spread shes probably violating duty yes justice blackmun example exact situation among five named parties moving parties case child received in medland family child entitled 200 father paying 200 worth child support her mother father decided two move house otherwise would included grant standard living would go wish occur indeed and think thats serious consequence regulation that in particular case moved father and course could number situations it seems would make sense court congress determine make presumption people obeying court orders absence evidence contrary i mean presumption makes sense people obey law opposed people dont obey law and course afdc law inquiry every single case every single applicant money household they send monthly report every month describe things of course money spent may well accounting money thats way would really current law would situation actually making income available would counted there may individual circumstances might case as general rule though there may well benefits there may well circumstances but say matter law mother must make choice difficulty again may would made individual basis best interest and perhaps somebody could prove court state court a hearing it wasnt best interest particular child but face take money one child spend child takes away state state court order says 200 used particular child takes away fathers expectation support children expected offset expenditures made afdc program children unrelated and disruption significant problem but may shes put unconstitutional condition and maybe given unconstitutional condition program decisions whats best interest may different but government putting position make choice well certainly that separate thats right and another theory liability government yes justice oconnor one cited brief aware local state situation father providing certain amount support went said look whats happening happened case state judge ordered family severed afdc purpose ordered county continue pay afdc children allowed father make inkind payments wouldnt counted and another situation presented case father paying 200 month voluntarily without court order when benefits assigned went county brought suit reduced amount 87 month so fact worked figures didnt lose much afdc course father willing able pay much support but wouldnt mattered his child would stayed standard living afdc family regardless much father paid support reduced the state talked much remedy imposed but id like say words presented case the state mentioned brief remedy incorrect case number reasons we think quite clear procedural posture case violation injunction the injunction entered 1971 clearly remedy exact thing going 1971 part state program at point cloak federal authorization claims but fact it federal statutory authorization theory statute we brief suggested statute read different way would cause constitutional problems caused application given secretary bowen thats correct but case there activity welfare department 1971 that activity enjoined and 1984 flouted state the injunction simply ignored state made decision proceed 1971 enjoined the state argued remedy lower court ordered pay back child support money taken pay back afdc benefits withheld families terminated result would violate eleventh amendment we think question would violate eleventh amendment number reasons first course yes yes yes argued theory rejected lower court would ask court affirm issue well what argued argued briefs eleventh amendment would bar effectively retroactive benefits the error position language edelman v jordan says date determining prospective retrospective relief date courtordered obligation act otherwise this court order entered 1971 and act accordingly that prospective order barred way eleventh amendment the states position appears soon violated injunction anything didnt pay transformed retroactive payments therefore barred eleventh amendment and think that position doesnt make sense consistent courts interpretation eleventh amendment we think would quite reasonable federal government constitutional looked family looked afdc recipients determined much need actually reduced fact someone else household may sharing burden joint expenses this particularly set brief talk economy scale reduction could made afdc payment for example well theres chart talks whats individuals standard need family and know that individual goes household gets larger need apartment its theyre counted theyre counted all theyre recognize need afdc recipients less dont share whole dont pay for example dont pay rent utilities shared expenses theres someone else income sharing so maybe theres quarter paid someone unit pay threequarters so need little bit less no i think i told way and either two ways suggested actually economy scale reduction afdc recipients individual analysis going family money actually transferred might count lets take example three people household the child support child gets 100 two get 200 afdc the mother uses money their need to say theres transfer thats congress cant take account but say two need little less theres person outside unit also contributing reasonable congress could cut matter and think thats constitutional would complaints if questions,660.0,1012,55,and think prior time pretty careful spend much and used spend 189 two much get afdc three so got 80 apiece ones got much apiece do think really careful make sure familys child support money getting husband went two children is real world talking talking mother lets say five children one support money spending money allotment child is real world i mean cinderellas reverse one child five lot money four dont because teenagers thats support money reality congress addressing statute reality mother spends whatever money children shes taking care isnt right do know case parent sued spending money wrong children i mean ive never even heard suit and think thats everybody really keeping close track much money theyre spending children what north carolina law right child that case talking turns around right child i take is what law judge mcmillan thought property right child well i know evidence besides judge what north carolina law but ignore state statute permitting mother make assignment doesnt sort undercut notion child right money yes state statute permits it doesnt say would choose best interest child cant make thats problem federal law it deprives able voluntarily choose apply afdc child apply afdc child assignment provision would end best interest the assignment provision doesnt change anything money paid paid best interests particular child your opponent i understood argue differently north carolina assignment law supersedes extent inconsistent strict youve reciting xxx voluntary isnt she forced apply afdc by law forced apply afdc oh condition xxx deal assignment statute yes consider process determining whether child property right he didnt consider state law says assign child support get afdc deemed benefit child but thats state law says doesnt something childs property right but isnt true always get least amount assign back sometimes plus 50 you example 189 child support 244 total 400 something get made assignment so got i see they always get back child support theyre trading dont get back would gotten child support plus former afdc without child counted i want sure one thing assume theres child support second assume 189 income working macdonalds didnt child support case would still unconstitutional program still unconstitutional require count money one pool its teenage daughters two teenage daughters work earned 189 theyd like spend but new rule must count part family pool result reduce total amount get is unconstitutional you think depends matter state law whether program bad my bottom line question would challenge constitutionality basic arrangement child support part it applied income children earned even though might precisely economic consequences well i dont know anything state law im looking economics burden people trouble making ends meet it would economically precisely situation why wouldnt precisely legal situation matter constitutional law isnt logic position 1984 amendment good whole even mother voluntarily wants include child entitled child support afdc program lets say father fact paying shed rather government try pursue father assign government get back afdc even would invalid wouldnt shes giving away oh shes gets back shes going spend child shes going to abide afdc regulations spend children but money go one child shouldnt and government collects it keeps so would bad wouldnt and would including afdc earnings well earnings child earns obligation support children theyre counted well take child support mother wants assign government couldnt oh i see onefifth something better hundred percent nothing i guess would right wasnt collecting thing mr wettach let ask pragmatic question do know case north carolina driven fortunate child home live elsewhere well i thought i havent heard mentioned morning and i or guardian ad litem came picture might well take position where child move did move father somewhere else ms wettach i suppose view would make casebycase determination child support payments used household know whether federal provision could applied ms wettach wouldnt say one one benefits child could receive one purposes mother may use father may use childs support money enable child live brothers sisters i mean lets assume lets assume mother getting support money one child couple children says i want child brought brothers sisters in order rather sending children away poor house somewhere im going to spend support money wouldnt think that would considered spending money benefit child wouldnt every circumstance mother decides trade support support money afdc benefits slightly support money enable keep family together cant considered benefit child entitled support money even doesnt get dollar dollar used hes getting brothers sisters thats different question though thats takings question thats question whether excessive coercion fundamental right something sort but whether taking cant say indeed mother traded value childs support money she gotten back company brothers sisters the family unit whole i dont know i expect i suit involving allegation support money wasnt spent entirely child destined mother using buy bare necessities children keep family together i doubt id find mother violation trust obligation xxx though thats takings point i think im right that separate point ms wettach found examples state court judges reduced child support orders impact program use money child support originally ordered theres doubt it federal authorization i thought case purely constitutional case since passage recent afdc amendment do still claim authorized statute but district court didnt agree point xxx has preserved eleventh amendment ms wettach leave what would suggest federal government done instead assuming finding correct legislative finding families use money get all members best interests whole family group including money support payments and federal government says we pay less we reduce amount it makes sense us reduce amount families 800 coming and know matter fact never mind theoretically theyre supposed spent two children know that family 800 used whole family this family 200 thats used whole family now i want cut hit family 800 family 200 how could federal government done lawfully but wouldnt allow support payments counted but thats reality congress found i dont care chart assume theory mother spending money house people use whatnot the reality congress perceived money comes family unit distributed among family members basis need period and congress wants take factor account you told theres way congrss thank ms wettach the case submitted,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-5,11,52.0,60.0

asserted defense qualified immunity may raised interlocutory appeal in answering question i think useful divide three component parts consider separately first whether official says violate clearly established law didnt violate law asserted defense qualified immunity second whether validity defense somehow called question existence predicate factual dispute defendant third whether immunity defense kind satisfies cohen test interlocutory appeals ill consider three points turn im sorry your honor the second issue i think integral component first whether existence predicate factual dispute defendant somehow calls question validity otherwise would valid qualified immunity defense on first point whether immunity defense court appeals view immunity comes play protect public officials acted face legal uncertainty therefore courts approach public official says didnt violate clearly established law law state flux uncertainty acted state immunity claim may take interlocutory appeal defense denied but approach public official says violate clearly established law evidence violated law raise immunity claim cannot take interlocutory appeal now think that approach based fundamental misunderstanding immunity doctrine immunity designed solely protect public officials face legal uncertainty act instead court repeatedly defined qualified immunity protect official defendants violate clearly established law that group necessarily includes defendants violate law either didnt commit acts alleged acts alleged clearly constitutional that point follows directly i think purposes immunity doctrine repeatedly stated court the court said time cases like harlow well i think your honor saying shouldnt liable were saying conceptually distinct immunity suit didnt violate clearly established law shouldnt lose immunity essentially thats right justice souter were saying well saying right interlocutory appeal theyve moved summary judgment ground violate clearly established law didnt well i think thats right two aspects well i think number aspects connected your honor i think useful look individually the first question claim immunity didnt violate law i think courts decision siegert v gilley makes clear first step involving immunity claim decide whether plaintiff alleged that would theoretically would possible every case on question whether genuine issue material fact whether defendant committed constitutional violation position let well let i if i take step back try describe conceptual framework i think makes clear asking resolving immunity claim going always to two steps the allegation defendant violates clearly established law in addressing claim court xx make assumption defendant apply clearly established law state facts looking first whether law clearly established clearly cannot lose immunity claim law clear constitutional fact claim defendant ultimately didnt violate law shouldnt detract immunity claim the second step inquiry right lets look defendant decide whether violated clearly established law now typically disputes defendants done cases immunity claimed situation court make assumption defendant it either accept allegation complaint look summary judgment record well i think certainly justice kennedy preventing liability public officials acted state legal uncertainty purpose immunity doctrine immunity considerably broader purposes siegert i think demonstrates clearly principle officials violate constitution time flux i think purpose conclusion siegert official defendant entitled immunity plaintiff made violation constitution the court said well i think several answers justice oconnor justice ginsburg ive done i apologize i think first significant empirical evidence good courts handling appeals sort there six circuits adopted rule endorsing they applied years difficulty sorting factual records this kind inquiry courts make routinely review decisions granting summary judgment motions i think no i dont question legal question whether genuine issue material fact court recognized repeatedly question law that question courts appeals resolve routinely i say appeals well i think contrary let make two points response first substantial number cases appeals taken majority reported decisions decisions district courts denying summary judgment motions overturned court appeals cite number decisions footnote 3 brief opening brief and i think substantial institutional constraints prevent public officials situation taking insubstantial appeals faced additional section 1983 attorneys fees liability ultimately lose merits district courts courts appeals procedures weeding insubstantial claims in fact every case well i think your honor depart basic principle court stated repeatedly immunity decisions harlow anderson mitchell point immunity doctrine fundamental purpose prevent trial insubstantial claims familiar reasons insubstantial suits innocent public officials burdens impose political system court no well im using your honor im using courts definition immunity protects public officials violate clearly established law necessarily i say includes officials didnt violate law it would perverse result well siegert mr chief justice court concluded first step determine whether violation law thats true thats true accept proposition immunity defense stated violation law necessarily hasnt violation clearly established law youre led question existence factual dispute somehow preclude appeal issue court make assumption defendant apply clearly established law in making assumption either sticks allegations complaint looks entire summary judgment record now courts decision anderson v creighton makes clear district court district court stuck allegations complaint theres factual dispute defendant relevant immunity question the court look entire record apply rule 56 ordinarily decide whether theres genuine issue material fact if issue court accept defendants version purposes resolving immunity argument in case would lead judgment defendants when appeal taken question is court appeals stuck district court said whether genuine issue material fact we think would peculiar rule say district court may consider entire summary judgment record court appeals cannot ordinarily courts appeals consider appeal question legitimately question always raised whether defendant violated clearly established law the court ordinarily considers issues no certainly harlow doesnt resolve question harlow sets framework determines whether defendant accorded liability say formulation harlow repeated courts cases the innocent defendant defendant harlow characterized defendant done nothing wrong subjected burdens litigation reasons court identified i think i probably better sit i chance immediate questions thank mr chief justice let start hypothetical presented opening argument justice breyer what happens case unsettled question law factual dispute theres doubt appeal lies case when gets court appeals state facts court assume as matters stand every circuit seventh circuit pointed including seventh circuit consider bound either statement complaint district courts conclusion instead court appeals makes determination whether theres genuine issue material fact looking entire summary judgment record approach makes perfect sense the question whether theres genuine issue fact defendant inextricably bound question whether defendants actions violated clearly established law well i think well i think typically certainly case but question justice ginsburg conduct defendant violative clearly established law the court make assumption defendant lets look first point probable cause issue had issue question fact disputed dispute arresting officers knew time arrest appellate court would factual basis resolving question whether probable cause whether reasonable officer would believed probable cause exist question is court stuck district court said whether theres genuine issue material fact may appellate court make determination question now well i think justice ginsburg question question law its easy question law is say defendants violative constitution the answer clearly always going question law issue law applied facts question facts court assume deciding question law in probable cause situation stated look officers knew looking officers knew say know either knew district court believed knew court appeals look record deciding and court question case unsettled question law would perverse say cant law clear defendant constitutional that would give favorable treatment defendants might actually violate constitution clearly thank your honor,547.0,723,12,well hear argument next number 94455 tyson johnson v houston jones mr rothfeld what second point you went fast youre immune youre innocent how possibly apply doctrine like youre immune youre innocent you dont know whether youre innocent youve facts displayed i mean seems immunity doctrine divorced reference principle law seems meaningless no isnt may i ask would proper restate position way youre claiming immunity trial two conditions met number 1 would entitled summary judgment trial number 2 youre public official therefore may take interlocutory appeal make good claim thats really youre saying isnt youre saying public officials right interlocutory appeal summary judgment issues value subjecting trial unless really genuine dispute would entitled judgment thats youre saying no thats keep bringing violate clearly established law as i understand position claim violate law clear may effect time acts and thats different concept immunity normal qualified immunity concept first concern public officials guess possible changes law clarifications law occur act here youre saying claim immunity satisfied effect value subjecting trial period unless theres genuine dispute fact kind thing raise summary judgment mr rothfeld maybe i clarify problem seems least way isnt claim every 1983 case public officer entitled interlocutory appeal evidentiary sufficiency isnt point not theoretically your position i didnt the question is sufficient evidence go trial every 1983 case clear question evidentiary sufficiency question law evidentiary sufficiency that may good rule i question trying sneak name immunity it bear resemblance doctrine immunity its doctrine automatic interlocutory appeal government officer it seems immunity usually used characterize situation official private person would liable reason official status if thats true i think youre proposing would inadequate would wrong mr rothfeld wouldnt better stick category we one category law clear thats case we another category plaintiff says defendant says i doesnt add violation federal law typical 12b6 case case i im liable i say i didnt dont stick case youve already said candidly every evidentiary sufficiency case goes appeal interlocutory basis whats troubling in cases involve clearly established law think relative competence the courts appeals know something law theyre really good facts nearly good trial court dont leave question evidentiary sufficiency trial judge say question law could take interlocutory appeal so dont think trial judges whole better feel facts courts appeal judges well mr rothfeld question ties justice ginsburg xx question like district court decide whether theres enough evidence go trial in case police officer found plaintiff banging head wall time arrest completed hed hauled jail found suffered broken ribs physical injuries consistent banging head wall now trial judge thought xx circumstantial evidence let go xx seems would rare case xx appeals going second guess kind xx say oh youve got wrong xx there may circuits xx kind thing many instances xx appeals really reversing trial judges xx facts i think youre asking something xx practical maybe extend everybody 1983 cases maybe everybody 1983 case every defendant makes summary judgment motion ought able get interlocutory appeal that purpose immunity doctrine follow everything deters prevents trial insubstantial claims immunity your equating immunity doctrine simply new device would happen achieve end would seems new law immunity doctrine but immunity mind defense you know state claim violation answer may true i immunity defense available whereas youre really attacking allegations complaint in siegert dispute facts we didnt take reevaluate factual conclusions summary judgment conclusions lower courts mr rothfeld i still think clearly established law coming case really doesnt fit it comes harlow wasnt justice white trying get rid getting officers head i want objective test whats clearly established law i dont want find whether particular officer knew law that clearly established it doesnt fit picture historic facts happened just time very well mr rothfeld ms pillard it always inextricably bound though and im reason i ask im wondering could make distinction basis typically case bound question i thought agreed defendants plaintiff alleged would violate clearly established law if beat defendant violated clearly established law i thought tell im wrong case good case illustration two questions one involve interlocutory appeal probable cause arrest question law the court appeals said yes a perfect case interlocutory appeal second issue defendants alleged beat plaintiff the defendants say the plaintiffs say yes everyone agrees violates clearly established law thats case appeal question law when dont question law case one question law thank mr rothfeld the case submitted,750.0,946,13,mr chief justice may xx please court the question presented whether absolute right appeal interlocutory order denying motion summary judgment trial judge found genuine issue material fact dispute simply moving party public official also raised qualified immunity defense thats i hear issue case the general rule clear narrow exceptions denials motion summary judgment immediately appealable thats law everyone subject must wait final judgment the reasons final judgment rule avoid delay unnecessary appeals precisely would result decision upheld thus claim case assault battery based events alleged complaint theres dispute would interlocutory appeal the question whether fact petitioners police officers claim qualified immunity allege acts alleged whether changes result in view narrow exception created mitchell its narrow exception apply much rationale mitchell present case okay in case i believe would first case scenario officer says i didnt anything i town i i didnt anything nothing happened that get upstairs mitchell wanted cases dismissed discovery that rationale mitchell mitchell court want police officers subjected suit burden whatsoever this case cases like necessarily require discovery done order appellate court district court pour factually factual record one half mitchell court mitchell wanted isnt even present secondly type question ever held court appropriate interlocutory appeal its different character the appellate courts determine state law teach us cases police officers governmental officials clearly established law they determine clearly established law focus really upon legal precedent facts the reviewing facts question fact your honor subordinate getting view getting real issue was violation established law case if youre court appeals judge seems though would take facts favorable nonmoving party okay you definitely look facts determine whats going yes i yes mr chief justice case agreed forego submit record court appeals i assure record pretty lengthy consider affidavits consider depositions taken police officers taken police officers case plaintiffs deposition expert disclosed deposed that suggested really i think suggested appropriate court appeals review whether district judge may made mistake respect deciding send case jury i think courts recent decision i think courts recent decision swint instructive i think you go back yes your honor it collateral merits i going go back first point narrow exception allow interlocutory appeals circumstances no if first case allowed determined appeal would allowed entertained wouldnt help anybody else handling type claim it wouldnt state new rule new law it would helpful case maybe say to say your honor though i think would say court appeals better decision better position equal position district court review factual determinations thats precisely function district court but courts appeals review facts determine whether clearly established law violated courts appeals interlocutory appeals setting qualified immunity defense asserted the general rule i thought your honor cannot take immediate appeal motion summary judgment denied you cannot narrow exception that appropriate question appellate review interlocutory appeal whether state law acts allegedly done yes yes orders entered limited discovery cases i read you limit discovery precisely issue without even getting damages issues issues may case but would still making factual determinations well case example police reports filed police individuals there directly contradictory statements plaintiff defendants there multiple injuries several broken ribs the police officers placed scene arrest exactly justice ginsburg determination lets say well district court case found question fact exists whether deeds complained now goes appellate court well appellate court supposed decide point is petitioners petition appellate court take sides determine fact credible another many facts yes much clearer record made rather vague affidavits inconsistent statements made thousands pages perhaps deposition testimony position appropriate time review sufficiency evidence trial sufficiency evidence trial jury might fact jury might hang hat think jury might believe fact fact opposed defendant opposed plaintiff okay i i put context case the law seventh circuit stand watch officers beat individual use excessive force culpable law clearly established now i think i think question officer since defense available law clearly established officer able assert im innocent district court didnt believe therefore i wanted try case appellate court xx notion thank mr chief justice may please court i would like start trying answer questions posed justice breyer justice kennedy morning respect facts fact types appeals allowed appellate court consider i thought motion dismiss pleading stage answer would pleadings if motion denial motion summary judgment estimation appellate court review facts district court found persuasive district court lays appeal the district court write opinion case laying facts case relied upon no no your honor and lays facts district court found persuasive point that would position interlocutory appeal decide whether question fact exists decide whether district court correct finding sufficient facts really fact jury could find would prove guilt innocence i dont think appellate court answer question your honor fact review i think question along lines factual inquiry appeals allowed appellate court review absolutely thats position thats position certainly district court every bit good better position make factual determinations whether question fact exists whether case go jury appellate court absolutely unequivocally position okay opposed case memorandum order written magistrate judge if theres questions i would say conclusion petitioners burden demonstrate court appeals allowed they havent done they havent met burden contrary issue would collateral merits it would unjustifiable deviation courts ruling cohen mitchell there separate right tried question whether official acts complained simply plea im guilty thats precisely question trial it could lead multiple appeals case would end then appeal would taken i would think every one types cases police officer summarily asserts district court made mistake respect deciding i used reasonable force instead excessive force i want appeal issue it wouldnt end issue appeal would taken every case it would cause undue hardship burden plaintiffs i expressed earlier benefits public officials least one half arent even present type scenario thank you,635.0,887,15,well mr proctor isnt officers point view much sympathetic officer said i didnt anything wrong officer says i something wrong wasnt clear wrong if get upstairs immediately second case shouldnt first case well facts take the real practical problem mentioned doesnt move people move lot what set facts court appeals supposed assume decides purely legal question whether theres qualified immunity kind standard youre talking look case comes the case involves plaintiff says policeman stood watched i beaten the policeman says i next room anyway isnt clearly established person stands watches liable the second obviously appropriate court appeals what facts court appeals supposed assume is supposed go i mean avoid youre court appeals going record see precisely policeman standing admit youre right road saying court appeals look see evidence support factual matter theres distinction giving appeal first place least workable one i could find im trying get focus i rejected seems important practical problem well i cant decide whether clear unless i know whether policemans door towards one room room the answer might differ im court appeals judge i know set facts im supposed answer question basis yes favorable supported record right ive done ive gone record make summary judgment determination which thats gives rise problem answered prior cases wouldnt facts alleged complaint ah go discovery you dont know facts its question law yes and doesnt court appeals consider facts alleged complaint the problem many cases long boards nobody district court thinks things alleged complaint often general nature much real issue i mean cases others cant well wouldnt consider affidavits filed connection summary judgment motion showing showing made plaintiff and court appeals would simply review district court done summary judgment yes but youve admitted court appeals go anyway decide immunity claim while youre finish job i mean i could understand position immunity motions motions limine theres discovery evidence youd go whats complaint bring one motions summary judgment context theres discovery side opportunity make discovery goes court why finish job youre i think answer statute dont openended authority provide interlocutory appeals cohen exception statute answer doesnt come within cohen its closely connected merits so might good idea get statutory amendment but im still concerned justice breyers concern suppose two arguments summary judgment stage one facts support claim the even facts support claim clearly established constitutional right are saying first goes court appeals only second goes court appeals say reversing usual order dont reach constitutional questions necessary no youre asking court appeals suppose issues case youre asking court appeals reach important difficult constitutional question might necessary strong argument facts dont establish position anyway reversing usual presumption dont reach constitutional issues unless defendant case says dont well always question law courts appeals theyre reviewing pleadings summary judgment they time not interlocutory setting course well mr proctor cant argue youre really reaching constitutional issue question effect state law time act is maybe way problem if thats appropriate maybe one answer problem i think bothers us justice breyer raised would say courts appeals going far afield records qualified immunity issues come answer perhaps they effect simply deciding qualified immunity issues based facts pleaded plaintiffs pleadings go thats confine review would easy make distinction kind case case us but would pretty much eliminate value defendant interlocutory appeal mitchell v forsyth if challenge plaintiffs pleadings complaint general vague forth get much clearer idea case discovery take depositions well would seem odd start constructing discovery rules based preserving interlocutory right appeal cohen doctrine perhaps could say something like pendent jurisdiction you could say position issue court appeals reviewing whether theres clearly established constitutional right similar issues law necessary case order reach issue look summary look facts sufficiency allegation court may that might something exception im afraid might swallow rule well factual determinations kind appellate court make summary judgment context ie determine sufficiency evidence allegations go forward and police officers said question violated clearly established law justice breyer asked positive complex kind case involved maybe questions motive category case i think significant number question someone says police beat police say didnt questions motive its question happened you started say yes thats kind case cries discovery in kinds cases discovery either courts appeals think allowed others think got tailored i thought starting saying case discrete category the thing thats issue happened whats anybodys head question law but appellate courts review sufficiency evidence usually trial but theres still problem haunting problem try explain officer says buddy idea may something wrong wasnt clear i wasnt anything wrong he gets avoid trial i dont how make sense well resume xx 100 pm mr proctor may resume but course district court doesnt find facts motion summary judgment it may decides rules basis either uncontroverted facts controverted favor nonmoving party so youre confined facts district court thought relevant legal inquiry but i thought saying thats appellate court only lose case case interlocutory review question happened but get awful lot i mean im saying insuperable problem it may possible resolve lot appellate ive seen quite lot quite decisions the defendant moves summary judgment one five defendants piece paper district court writes word denied thats no findings nothing judge wants send trial its complicated lets get sorted know talking thats kind case thats worrying my worry insuperable it doesnt mean theres way et cetera thats i worried thank mr proctor mr rothfeld 3 minutes remaining,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,379.0,592,11,thank mr chief justice may please court we agree petitioner right petitioner seeks properly characterized part immunity i dont think nomenclature really key the key right tried insubstantial claims much stake mitchell v forsyth the way protect right allow immediate appeal the reason court mitchell recognized right tried protect public officials exercises discretion long dont violate clear law fear baseless suits create skewed incentives drive public officials inaction public interest requires act that fear created much suits like one lack evidentiary basis celotex anderson suits based unclear law the respondents anything even entitled claim right tried persons violate law i think would i think would your honor thats interests would served cases i would say would decide rule petitioners case whether claim rule 12b6 rule 56 included assertion official violate clear law might apply it might apply wouldnt that would included distinction i trying make might dispositive defenses would statute limitations something well i think key question responding whether cohen applies whether reason recognize right tried mitchell court found cchen factors including separability factor easily met there right tried now inquiry separate merits its threshold rule 56 inquiry whether theres sufficient evidence go forward know the issue cohen whether denial motion security counsel fees right could thats right moreover youre exactly right theres overlap i think mitchell right tried stake close association merits tolerated under mitchell required issue conceptually distinct i think i wanted add response questions bench mr rothfeld justices oconnor ginsburg i think suggesting perhaps might practical defer district court sifting evidence limit kind appeal mitchell circumstance theres really doctrinal question court appeals address i two responses one really addressing policies recognizing right tried second perhaps technical that idea making distinction legal issues sifting evidence legal issues doctrinal runs contrary fundamental impetus harlow the court harlow reformulated qualified immunity inquiry precisely ensure qualified immunity would susceptible pretrial disposition courts less likely tied jury disposition facts say mitchell turn takes unique narrow view legal determination thereby deprives courts appeal thats right point really slightly general level notion taking doesnt require jury trial perhaps motive inquiry would require jury trial here rule 56 established that doesnt infringe seventh amendment jury right doesnt entrench factfinders rule yet suggestion i think even going leave inquiry district courts i think cuts impetus harlow say lets take much make legal determination make susceptible disposition pretrial district court errs susceptible correction immediate appeal well im aware thats issue court granted certiorari one mechanisms courts appeals explored i think rule restricting one every case might rigid i think interest finality might adherent cohen finality doctrine might kind limitation number appeals there may cases multiple appeals would appropriate well i think anderson v liberty lobby court appeals would proper position affirm district courts decision go ahead let mess go trial for reason district court applied rule 56 way the court appeals could well suggestion but i think also point premised distinction wouldnt work i think take hypothetical mitchell case shows distinction would frustrate even core qualified immunity claim for example district court mitchell denied qualified immunity found law clear instead denied erroneously holding dispute evidence case whether national security justification wire tap court appeals kind case look record conclude district court wrong without correcting error court appeals would unable verify claim falls within gray area qualified immunity warranted now kind review sifting evidence available case otherwise mitchell would deprived immunity conduct would state law would interest prompt disposal case would mitchell case refusal consider district courts error inheres evaluation whether facts meet rule 56 standard something amenable interlocutory review,200.0,317,10,may i ask position would also lead allowing appeals cases denials motion dismiss legal insufficiency yes basically interlocutory order used think interlocutory would appealable defendant 1983 case could say really isnt much basis suit how violate law did violate law where get i mean certainly nothing like cohen v beneficial said got issue side merits this nub merits somebody it seems would take cohen totally away purpose something tied merits what cohen issue cohen security costs it nothing merits litigation this everything merits litigation ms pillard i thought harlow case concerned motive said didnt want judges exploring whats head public officer thats motive case here theres question motive its question objectively it seems adopt position one way curtail number appeals would say another case dispute yet resolved one interlocutory appeal would agree position would agree position everything said protecting officer seems to indicate would allow multiple appeals new affidavits new evidence adduced summary judgment disposition first goaround so youre telling us so youre telling us motion interlocutory appeal every summary judgment case multiple well right then doesnt i mean youre asking i think cut doctrine loose mooring cohen i think theres argument theres pretty thinking case policeman says i timbuktu theres doubt shot plaintiff i mean hes liable says i timbuktu time thats issue now stop appeals coming time justice kennedy suggested though goes case hearing october but practical thing bothered get cases courts appeals complicated factually peoples motives often district courts circumstances say send trial practical way run things send trial im going go 5000 affidavits state mind 15 prison officers lets try well get facts it work then youre going asking trial court appeals going to separating things deciding factual matters states mind even district court couldnt decide thats sent trial struck kind mess im saying thats determinative argument problems side id like get response why why how could youd thank ms pillard mr proctor,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-3,8,-96.0,-88.0
93,2015.14-857,Campbell-Ewald Company v. Gomez,14-857,1444798800.0,1453269600.0,Campbell-Ewald Company,Jose Gomez,6.0,3.0,0,992.0,2076,43,thank mr chief justice may please court to affirm ninth circuit first two questions presented court must accept following two propositions first plaintiff force court adjudicate merits claim simply refusing defendants offer capitulation complete relief and second plaintiff amounts substantive right class litigation applies soon complaint filed entitles case proceed even individual claim drops  i dont think your honor the district court found page 40 petition appendix the ninth circuit decided case based premise thats page 5a petition appendix so i think case comes  i think your honor now  argued reason wasnt complete relief  didnt provide attorneys fees but tcpa underlying statute provide attorneys fees i dont think thats complete relief means your honor i think means plaintiff received everything could  could received judgment   he  i  okay first case comes court i think accepted offer complete relief now let try answer points raise first hes entitled finding liability if litigant always entitled finding liability essentially case could become moot if take voluntary cessation context litigant could always insist hes still entitled finding liability well your honor i think accepted principle settlement moots case requires court dispose case i mean i think thats accepted principle and  well  well your honor i think  i think case consistent kokkonen case what kokkonen case recognized case come end court ancillary jurisdiction dispose in case dealt enforcement consent decree here fundamental  well first your honor case rule 68 offer judgment freestanding settlement offer so think mechanics rule 68 dont apply its  well i dont  i dont think i mean still presents question whether controversy still exists given defendant offered plaintiff everything  could secure federal judgment and plaintiff genesis healthcare asked collective action the court found that allegation  well i mean heres i think different your honor youre right it different but different court repeatedly said class independent legal status certified and different in genesis healthcare statutory right collective action court said that didnt trump article iii and  well still pretty important plaintiff case statutory right and question when individual claim drops basis action proceed simply  potential class could certified and  thats costsharing argument made roper and i could say couple things first plaintiff case unlike plaintiff roper never made argument he never argued favor cost sharing in fact complaint look page 21 joint appendix touts financial resources necessary bring action second roper court relied interest solely purpose allowing appeal denial certification mooting event occurred denial certification so real relation back issue if court wrong denying certification case never would become moot first place here mooting event takes place certification theres nothing relate back and court make determination like court determine whether defendant says hes going stop action truly voluntarily ceased action well i think absolutely like would voluntary cessation context i  i want clear i think little bit  the  reason  one party throws towel match here question whether theres article iii case controversy defendant longer fighting result thing issue thats  words court used san pablo case thats article iii determination and functionally  a  court certainly make determination whether provided complete relief in case like youre dealing liquidated damages thats easy its  no  well youre right your honor thats rule 68 offer if go page 57a petition appendix theres freestanding settlement offer isnt rule 68 offer the thing rule 68 really designed situation complete relief its designed situation defendant plaintiff gamble essentially whether offer less complete relief sufficient they  want settle basis in case freestanding settlement offer it provided complete relief question whether  plaintiff personal stake case sufficient  outcome case sufficient keep case alive justice kennedy get back point settlement and i think whats important recognize  heres position when offer complete relief made court determined indeed complete relief case come end now whether say  moot precise moment whether say starts ball rolling hill towards dismissal entry judgment plaintiff based terms offer point  defendant offered everything courts cant go ahead expound law now court repeatedly said necessary decide necessary decide and thats fundamental principle stake defendant offered everything plaintiff  well would unusual situation your honor i think  and   know ropers another case offer court never  didnt really question case whether offer mooted claim merits the question whether could appeal denial certification here plaintiffs position asking court go far beyond court recognized roper really recognize substantive right class adjudication at end day thats theyre insisting as soon filed class complaint  i  i dont think describe procedural right this court said rule 23 procedural mechanism when requirements met said theres separate legal status class class certified the jacobs  well okay well first  yes first court recognized two narrow exceptions your honor first appeal denial class certification mooting event happens case appeal thats roper case and second inherently transitory exception now even clear respondents asking either exception i dont see relation back inherently transitory red brief clear first exception doesnt apply case doesnt involve appeal denial class certification clear second case exception doesnt apply inherently transitory genesis court made clear concern socalled picking wasnt sufficient basis say claim inherently transitory that exception doesnt deal defendants litigation conduct deals whether claimants conduct going recur like pretrial temporary detention situation this case doesnt fit  exception if  yes your honor a  couple answers your honor first thats issue case theyve never disputed campbellewalds ability pay second i think court determine plaintiff  defendant ready able pay and third situation case dismissed mootness based terms offer turns cant execute offer  i mean thats situation court  plaintiff go back court say based   dismissed case erroneous factual premise thats like judge friendly decision cite reply brief so situation going happen and practical concerns going go away court recognizes case defendants offer complete relief ends case controversy individual claim the case goes away the plaintiffs going accept offer i dont think  certainly wouldnt classic certification decision factor your honor and i think  i mean one reasons court insists article iii case controversy wants insist doesnt expound law  well  certainly unusual situation personal representative made whole now  claims  well i suppose could terms person represented real question why would want court expound law difficult questions certification court knows well anyone theres case controversy begin defendant offered plaintiff everything and question if individual claim drops interests  put judge friendlys terms interest  plaintiff  well youre right your honor distinction i think judge friendly said applies equally plaintiff loses individual interests case  right  litigate class action might benefit others he also pointed offer complete relief case kind situation puts plaintiff better position default judgment the plaintiff everything asks hes walking away money and point earlier justice sotomayor clear offer case included stipulation injunction well so  well cant undo past conduct no  well three responses first san pablo case example courts decision specifically makes clear plaintiff refused offer second  thats  thats course right your honor course acceptance rule little bit odd court didnt mention fact didnt accept the point i wanted make response justice sotomayors question we cited long footnote opening brief many cases recognizing principle reply brief cite holding case english courts its 1840 case case exactly point involving situation claim brought debt defendant came said heres money court case  plaintiff refused accept and court case said beholden duty end case given  defendant offered everything   plaintiff seeking so i think first  quibble  i think theres longstanding practice recognizing defendant offered everything could secure case goes away second i think maybe important i mean i would say dissent genesis healthcare recognizes acceptance cant rule cases i mean recognize situation plaintiff doesnt accept obstinacy madness youre recognize acceptance cant rule and thats got right voluntary cessation context dont require plaintiff accept and  i think  i mean point realize case cant  cant go hes offered everything case comes court  question court well dispose do tell lower court dismiss moot tell lower court enter judgment plaintiff based terms offer point clearly becomes moot i mean court  no hasnt  there hasnt adjudication your honor its judgment entered based terms offer its judgment adjudicating claim merits its judgment court picking winner loser the court simply recognizing fact defendant offered everything judgment entered  well first judgment technically order disposing case i mean went back looked district court judge issued judgments cases dismissed moot it reflects case come end second weve recognized alternative position sixth circuit position  situation dispose case entering judgment plaintiff based terms offer thats judgment merits adjudicating claim merits its picking winner involving court picking winner  loser  winner resolves hypothetical concerns theyve raised eliminating case actually check hand and thats  thats appropriate way disposing case and one argue theres article iii interest  proceeding litigation judgment disposing case and back  your honor  accord satisfaction example contractbased doctrine it happens  payment made case gets litigation theres  theres principle once  litigation begins principle controls article iii article iiis case controversy requirement requires plaintiff  personal stake live personal stake outcome case stages proceeding and first question point youve offered everything could receive  thats case comes offered everything could get favorable judgment individual claim  theres longer personal stake litigating case outcome  just true genesis healthcare wouldbe class representative exact position case goes away could still file claim he settle claim provide  file class action and know arguing policy arguments whether court ought find basis keep class action alive thats appropriate determination article iii well  gets concern sorts class actions going go away first  hard feel sorry plaintiffs everything could possibly ask what talking asking people practical matter sorts class actions get pennies dollars claim the big money goes class action lawyers all addressed congress wants address addressing  well  its like voluntary cessation context your honor in case  he  he could ask unicorn your honor the court make determination and youd want make determination went ahead adjudicated claim merits whether  deciding difficult questions certification whether going ahead making law tcpa whether going ahead making law  he dispose  the court make mootness determination it every context mootness arise and article iii wants court make determination court goes expounds law if i could return  reserve remainder time thank mr chief justice first article iii principle control resolution case stated san pablo case page 314 the court said court empowered decide moot questions declare rules law cannot affect result thing issue case and thats exactly whats issue case  court today im  im talking technical distinction cases im talking article iii principle controls your honor  your honor court  a court makes determination offer complete would make determination defendant fact voluntarily  okay thank and  court case as always would mootness determination of course yes you could  could case settled your honor i think justice scalia exactly right answer theres  theres decades centuries practice dealing situation settlement context everyone agrees court repeatedly said settlement moots case that doesnt mean courts dont afforded ancillary jurisdiction   dispose case well i dont think  i  i think  little bit chicken egg situation your honor this court repeatedly said settlements  moot cases yet courts authority enter relief well were back whether plaintiff force court proceed ahead expound law and i think friends presentation  no the case go forward view courts expound law theres independent interest receiving judgment if thats rule mootness table in almost case defendant  always  plaintiff always say i want judgment were  question really how get rid case because i think even recognize  offer complete relief courts held case come end theres two options court one hold case dismissed moot two  dont agree two hold case disposed entering judgment plaintiff based terms  offer complete relief thats sixth circuit rule you go look there plenty judgments courts implemented rule theres evidence difficulty applying disposes cases commonsense fashion it prevents courts  courts going ahead expounding law cases business if i could make one point immunity issue justice ginsburg youre exactly right they sued wrong party mindmatics everything case least entitled immunity vicarious liability,836.0,1312,23,well hear argument first morning case 14857 campbellewald company v gomez mr garre is controversy whether   offer complete relief do take assumption but thats merits question whether theyre entitled attorneys fees if question complete  know complete relief means plaintiff asked the plaintiff asked attorneys fees well would  would receive finding liability didnt admit offer he would  would entitled injunction activity activity caused particular situation others shown injunction ways so i dont see could  putting aside class action putting aside attorneys fees appear to fairly critical liability determinations made court it  seems want us write  opinion saying settlement offer equivalent judgment and weve cases like kokkonen case settlement approved court case dismissed settlement performed they went court seeking injunction the court said no you contract you file you go different court you start a settlement offer settlement contract settlement agreement different judgment judgment but didnt pursue you didnt apply rules judgment and   want us write opinion say oh well settlement offer judgment doesnt equate federal rules civil procedure cases like kokkonen case but federal rule point mr garre  says  rule 68 says offer judgment expires automatically 14 days accepted it deemed withdrawn cannot used purpose saddle plaintiff costs doesnt get offer so federal rule directly point instructs litigants offer judgment means why look well isnt rather end run around offer judgment the plaintiff  plaintiff asks class action didnt get werent far  far along enough plaintiff even move certification but collective action simply device permissive joinder its quite different genesis recognized class action  i dont remember justice thomas exact words whole different kettle fish all   invitation people join thats   permissive joinder one  one  potential the i would entitled attorneys fees loser theres class lot people share attorneys fees ill pay less but i could go back little bit mr garre and i think question justice scalia started there number things youve said well asked hes entitled he asked attorneys fees hes entitled attorneys fees and asked injunction declaratory relief hes entitled and asked class certification hes entitled case moot and case moot seems to non sequitur in words hes asked things havent offered things theres dispute whether hes entitled things now might completely right hes entitled attorneys fees but adjudicated you cant  court cant say oh youve offered complete relief view havent offered complete relief thats litigation a court absolutely make determination but question court make determination guise mootness motion why cant  cant context summary judgment motion i mean moot case wouldnt appropriate vehicle summary judgment motion admit facts make liable concede facts make liable and fight legal questions but i  whats article iii determination whether entitled relief

jurisdictional dismissal the live dispute obtaining court judgment incorporates relief thats offered the mere offer complete relief anything mootness even plaintiff defendant agree proper judicial relief question situation whether court enter judgment plaintiff dismiss case lack jurisdiction there might defense merits mr garres client say weve paid debt but thats something goes  the defendant would defense merits he could plead accord satisfaction could plead res judicata because theres  theres past injury thats alleged caused defendant could redressed theory judicial relief that  he shouldnt get anything addition hes already received goes merits whether article iii case controversy exists when court  yes well hasnt obtained  right the concrete injury past injury hes already suffered that injury already remedied defense goes merits it doesnt go article iii everyone agrees justice kennedy hypothetical case thrown court the dispute whether thrown court jurisdictional grounds article iii whether bounced merits defendant affirmative defense if certain conduct wont reoccur when youre dealing past injury mr chief justice theres always past injury remains even  there adversity plaintiff comes court  if plaintiff comes court demanding defendant says youre entitled adversity justice kennedy now plaintiff legally entitled additional damages merits hes already paid but goes merit thats part article iii inquiry redressability article iii ask whether plaintiff legally entitled relief demands he could making utterly meritless claim relief but thats article iii question article iii assumes plaintiff would legal entitlement relief demanded asks whether relief granted court would redress injury  just  clear  mr chief justice offered everything weve demanded we   right no im sorry the district court say theres  page 40a petition appendix the district court say matter law finding fact offered complete relief what district court said page 40a said assumes sake argument offer constituted complete relief   right the end  only individual claims and district court wrong say dispute if look docket entry  no didnt we disputed ninth we said ninth circuit district court wrong say page 40a petition appendix its docket entry 13 ninth circuit record  no the ninth circuit assumed sake argument  no i dont  i dont  i dont agree mr chief justice there binding precedent ninth circuit already got diaz pitts said even offer complete relief defendant moot case so defendant throws hands unconditionally surrenders whether class action nothing mootness it may justify forced entry judgment moot case and thats problem mr garre cannot get around campbellewald insists case court  no those mutually exclusive if case moot court cannot enter judgment ever circumstance the proper response situation dismiss lack subject matter jurisdiction rule 12b1 there never judgment it and thats exactly settlement  no case  the case moot if court entering judgment definition case moot mootness requires jurisdictional dismissal mootness forbids entry type judgment so campbellewald come court say district court retained prerogative enter judgment merits offer complete relief tendered confession offer complete relief case  thats still judgment it  oh may  may resolve merits purposes issue preclusion thats correct justice scalia still judgment rule 58 it courtordered relief and court cannot case lacks subjectmatter jurisdiction mootness forced entry judgment mutually exclusive yes there case controversy might lead forced entry judgment plaintiff obstinacy types reasons wants decline offer its hard imagine the controversy  the controversy plaintiff wants judgment court incorporates relief a mere offer defendant legal nullity hes getting money enter judgment  dismiss mootness the judgment would say you asked x the defendant offered x this case both sides agree proper legal relief   enter judgment no hes saying moot now hes trying say mootness allows court also enter judgment thats contradiction terms moot yes right and backed force court it enforced contempt citations meer offer complete relief cant in fact unaccepted offer legal effect you still   may still enforce judgment thats much easier enforcing  offer we dont money hand its offered if actually money hand entitled additional judgment defendant case would defense merits it still doesnt justify throwing us court mootness its jurisdictional  im sorry go ahead no not tried no the court say terminating litigation entering judgment mr plaintiff youre accepting unconditional surrender defendant you dont go go trial situation you enter judgment plaintiff its thrown lack jurisdiction a jurisdictional dismissal sends plaintiff home emptyhanded with nothing no judicial relief this unaccepted offer it hasnt accepted it cant enforced way not contract remedy well certainly would moot if wants accept entry judgment everything weve asked includes attorneys fees real injunction vague obey law injunction thats offer class certification class relief right right but  one get class certification court first concludes individual claims become moot and theres way claims mooted simply offer  but comes  question presented asked whether offer complete relief moots case and answer   question im sorry well thats one  yes thats  thats one many reasons  yes yes i wouldnt say agree  no dont it may moot right he gets judgment merits situation its actually important distinction because many reasons all right ill start one the question presented asks whether offer complete relief renders case  all right it may well defendant case comes court says case district court would prerogative enter judgment merits defendant plaintiff already paid plaintiff cant double dip that goes merits but campbellewald never asked district court judgement merits i dont agree implying that would moot case fine okay if hes gotten everything hes asked goes  yeah apart class action complicated question the case youre talking class certification roper holds specifically representative plaintiff continue litigating class certification theres  that situation roper there forced entry judgment imposed representative plaintiffs and court allowed representative continue litigating class certification issue financial stake class certification decision and mr gomez likewise financial stake  theres two one cost sharing lawyers yes of course  offer yes right the one would incentive award would recover class certified case proceeds either settlement victory and thats another  the incentive award normally representative plaintiff class gets certified settlement gets  that  might something court consider rule 23 whether person adequate representative but dont think much difference incentive award still gives incentives press fellow class members and courts upheld qui tam litigation  yeah even close yeah thats correct but thats one many reasons win mootness question and know theres still problem mutual exclusivity mootness finding forced entry judgment no thats correct and went beyond  there optin lists maintained companies like mindmatics campbellewald discovered thats would go proving theyre entitled  what would get settlement i would imagine would probably get  if settles theyre entitled 500 piece statutory damages could trebled 1500 show violation it would based whether appeared optin list whether appeared type optin list  you check box submit form says youre interested receiving emails text messages certain topics and case navy instructed campbellewald send text messages people opted receive information money college travel adventure something related navy and list assembled properly yes mindmatics campbellewald vicariously liable ones sued but yes the ninth circuit found  may i answer thank the ninth circuit found tcpa incorporates vicarious liability campbellewald vicariously liable mindmatics actions and appeal that law case,649.0,1145,38,if theres  youre getting everything want case controversy what live dispute personal stake terms use article iii so  well youre worried wont make good offer  suppose mr garre right take big stash cash briefcase certified check present would case left that would  would case controversy if individual action plaintiff received  damages   amount potential damages undisputed plaintiff received amount defendant dispute wouldnt live case controversy what controversy which would give  defendant  would give plaintiff addition money hypothetical youre saying defendant  interest  pardon  plaintiff interest judgment   quite separate obtaining relief requests     well lets assume case asked 10000 10000 deposited bank irrevocable instructions pay what   concrete injury chief justice said results adversity im sorry go ahead voluntary cessation moot case whether plaintiff likes right well certain theyre going give money asked isnt result applied in words simply plaintiff wants he doesnt want money hes asking wants judgment give money as far i tell thats argument but adversity chief justice mentioned first question and 10000 bank hes injured  sum 10000 theres adversity other    stigma judgment you put lot weight plaintiffs  theres another interest  courts interest youre given everything want you say well weve past injury well asked relief youre given and yet say nonetheless entitled enlist court courts time and article iii entitled get legal ruling even though theres  theres nothing give you wont  wont take yes answer well thats  thats factual question the district court said  page 40a no sorry sorry counsel thats says its assume sake argument say parties dispute defendants rule 68 offer would fully satisfied individual claims asserted   could asserted plaintiff action well ninth circuit proceed decide case basis finding did ninth circuit proceed decide case basis assumption district court factual determination correct i think proceed decide question  well youre  youre  youre contrasting forced entry judgment one hand mootness but forced entry judgment one remedies mootness no i dont  i think  i think settlement parties agreed settlement court enter judgment even though case moot   settlement it judgment merits its   judgment affirming settlement affirming parties agreed it doesnt go merits claim  clear facts without getting dispute lets say offer  relief asked not question think youre entitled think everything youve asked including attorneys fees so theres question cost shifting anything like all injunctive relief they come say write injunction you say still case controversy could proceed litigation whats  controversy in case ive hypothesized   controversy you said plaintiff obstreperous whatever know  refusing take spite reason in case and would judgment say but i thought thats   mr garre arguing he said hed need judgment and i take judgment youre talking would he offered its everything asked we ordering pay and    thing dismissed if case dead theres  judgment entered seems even dead youve actually got case hand if judgment youre going  may enforce judgment you dont actually anything value you piece paper thats better  better  somebody gave choice judgment says youre entitled certain amount money money hand would rather judgment but that first hypothetical if actually money hand okay but wouldnt moot  sorry my goodness so every case tried even youve   paid hes i want judgment and say moot so  if mr garre youre leaving court  courtroom today says accept entry judgment one well make sure get whatever attorneys fees want accept entry judgment then  case would would oh well thats whole thing right this class certification so case comes put away  hypothesize youre getting everything plaintiff case asked comes whether get class certified and youre saying  and youre saying  excuse and youre saying possibility could get class certified my hypothesis get everything else okay the thing dont say  enter judgment you want judgment heres judgment you want attorneys fees heres attorneys fees you want injunction you know go ahead write injunction but say still might able representative plaintiff class action i dont see one  of course  would good  thing i thought interesting i wanted know position aflcio brief which side do agree i want know do agree fine but what say right way go  cite cases forth 19th century  defendant  youre right its offer relief what say defendant supposed tender money and tenders money plaintiff wont accept goes court deposits money court and court issues judgment saying case thats i read pages 9 11 lots authority gets rid problem and theres  seems isnt right isnt why   judge say want 10000 what defendant says wont take check certified so deposits court the judge point say defendant wants the case goodbye and course person wants cant certify class isnt harmed fine give judgment merits who cares why well give one im interested moment question asked i interested question i asking and isnt i said you sound agreeing aflcio no dont say effect would what i want  im practical and practical thing defendant wants pay plaintiff giving everything wants is way what say yes way tender money certified check wont take pay money court and  judge enters judgment favor plaintiff gotten everything asked not class certification theres nothing says  no complicated question in hypothetical im saying circumstances agree  do agree not the thing thats left youd like says plaintiff class certification least lawyer would even though theres certified check tendered plaintiff judgment entered giving  saying case hes got everything wants what  financial stake okay well cost  thats fully satisfied offer covers attorneys fees okay now  right what one the incentive award is  concern plaintiff received offered relief could receive appropriate representative plaintiff parties gotten relief so argument individual plaintiff gotten everything asked  i realize argue isnt case   entitled proceed litigation might get bonus class action would like lead okay can i ask practical question is mr garre right case proceed  class certified get judgment case class action attorneys going get lot members class going get virtually nothing you would prove  establish damages would members class consent receive messages right how would how would able  prove somebody  member class point agreeing something internet didnt click box said i agree receive messages know big class senders what think class members would get individual class members practical matter would get end  a settlement youre  what and youre going able determine  prove certain people consent what  get optin list we havent talked second issue raise one curiosity  actor something wrong  mindmatics but didnt sue what reason went contractor so youre relying vicarious liability sure thank mr mitchell mr yang,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,390.0,689,13,mr chief justice may please court id like take opportunity clarify article iii question addressing elements article iii case controversy established federal practice i believe shows offer  unaccepted offer particular cannot moot case and theres time id like address derivative sovereign immunity argument first distinction court established prospective relief retrospective relief when seek prospective relief need show ongoing imminent injury in context defendant actually halt injury thats necessary stopping long meet voluntary cessation doctrine long show capable repetition youre going review so injury respect prospective relief injury thats occurring future end when talking retrospective relief damages injury past its undone an offer money may compensation injury injury continues exist for purposes article iii question injury it fairly traceable thats established past injury  caused defendant and requested judicial relief would likely redress injury now requested relief even theres offer i want money second  well  i dont believe its embedded request relief the plaintiff comes court says i want relief court the defendant says no dont grant relief ive either  case moot i think thats whats going there distinction  i believe embedded  well case moot the court grant relief the court enters judgment ordering relief enforceable courts powers quite distinct judgment dismissal one jurisdiction that  thats  need  court needs article iii power direct remedy defendant its quite unlike dismissal one jurisdiction its also quite unlike remedy vacatur undoes court judgment so mr garres know attempt kind frame either know  prospective relief case case youre getting judgment judgment dismissal one jurisdiction enforceable judgment way relevant purposes article iii jurisdiction in part i believe thats right the  parties agree when say weve agreed  give case normally thought moot but  several longstanding federal practices federal courts actually well state courts i think reflects point a party  parties agree settle case court retains jurisdiction enter consent decree this enforceable judgment justice kennedy talked kokkonen this distinction settlement offer judgment the court authority enter consent decree even parties settled thats offer its actual  settlement two courts  no it  the case moot parties  saying agreeing entry judgment agreeing abstract   settle case what  this remarkable proposition courts time   time enter consent decrees these enforceable power court two also dismiss prejudice that dismissal one jurisdiction its resolution claim three enter judgment rule 68 offer also look affirmative defenses waivable rule 8c according satisfaction payment res judicata right the court would dismiss case one jurisdiction saying injury but  our point  the standing inquiry course addressed relevant stage case so instance pleading stage failed allege injury sufficient  its  judgment lack standing that injury its resolution claim there  difference judgment want jurisdiction court i dont power address in judgment court says i power  enter relief enforceable collateral proceedings   great power federal court that big difference a court requires article iii jurisdiction exercise power litigants and thats normally happens consent decrees dismissals prejudice judgment rule 68 offer and also conversely even party fully paid the fact defense payment  accord satisfaction waived so end case defendant hasnt actually raised belatedly says i forgot i paid guy claim thousand dollars court says sorry forfeited judgment another 1000 the  and i dont want mislead court thinking advocating protracted litigation claims powerful defense like payment that merits defense weve paid claim you dont  cant get anymore money but  question courts power entertain merit defense saying  like fact affirmative defenses may waived even res judicata court already adjudicated claim yet defendant raise court held doesnt go courts jurisdiction and  could get relief twice this article iii question rule 23 question i think could considered court exercising discretion rule 23 i think  i  i think thats hard let tell to adequate represented  representative class cant simply looking interests you looking interests class and thats part requirement a defendant says ill accept money drop interests class know  wonder whether defendant  plaintiff actually good adequate representative rule 23  stepping away article iii question were getting questions discretion,219.0,376,6,im sorry those three requirements article iii standing theres additional requirement adverseness none three requirements  set forth  opinions deal adverseness thats separate  separate issue and thats whats challenged there injury fact okay it attributable  defendant okay and court must able remedy none three requirements classic requirements deals quite separate point adverseness if somebody comes says yes youve injured court could provide relief i agree money mr yang i  i  i understand petitioner  respondents counsel arguing someone judge say point fact complete relief enter judgment complete relief thats argument all right parties could stipulate if  accept offer settlement thats like stipulation saying complete relief us theres adversity right excuse it  authority enter even though case moot right but theres settlement offer accepted court nonetheless issue judgment enforcing settlement oh  so  even though parties adverseness all agree outcome want court go matter weve agreed want judgment is     article iii adverseness requirement i think remarkable what happens grounds lack jurisdiction what plaintiff injury there injury the court  words  requirements article iii jurisdiction rehearsed happens case no jurisdiction another reason besides mootness well  plaintiff comes says well i want  i want judgment or   bases i want  i want  whatever reason i mean theyre  insisting judgment even though arguably depending upon scope offered relief case moot other cases say dismiss   doesnt go trial or  get benefit court determination i think youre wrong i think theres standing i dont think get dismissed moot i think get judgment defendant plaintiff standing indeed so  fact court issues judgment nothing whether theres article iii standing whether theres mootness you enter judgment even though theres article iii standing so even  even plaintiff given relief entitled say plaintiff still right involve federal court  and i  i  i cant say controversy still right call  go federal court say i know federal court youre busy lot things i still want hear case even though ive gotten everything i could get is  plaintiff given relief hes requested view united states adequate class representative well course i want know position thank counsel mr garre four minutes remaining,-15,5,407.0,187.0

sentenced now sentencing hearing big thing you sentencing hearing one afternoon couple hours why sentence man proper factors alone when walks courtroom knows sentenced things actually proven these things properly proven considered the seventh circuit held improper thing they admit why go send back appellate court consider sentencing anyway the sentencing done district court and give man sentence he going sentenced question he going found guilty sentenced do proper factors when i sent williams copy opinion seventh circuit called said well seventh circuit said error considered point sentencing isnt right and i said yes right he said well fair why sentence man correct factors its easy why bring factor create terrific doubt there several circuits would say improper factor considered thats wrong way go thing if done complete proper factors send back do right then knows hes then everybody knows what sentence done basis correct factors there reason keeping improper factor sentencing do correct factors and objectives sentencing guidelines youre creating want honesty sentencing want proportionality want uniformity those three factors guidelines put effect convicting man sentencing improper well proper factors doesnt improve position guidelines requiring put effect honesty sentencing there several circuits hold remand consider improper factors the ninth tenth fifth circuit clearly hold situation considered i going give yes yeah well one united states v hernandezvasquez ninth circuit case 884 f 2d 1314 the guidelines anticipate departure rare if court relies ninth circuit court relies proper improper factors sentence must vacated case remanded because district court considered improper factors must vacate sentence remand resentencing moreover another case ninth circuit court statement reasons contained improper well proper basis departure way determine whether portion sentence based upon consideration improper factors where district court fails determine accuracy challenged information presentence report state relying information judgment must reversed case remanded resentencing the tenth circuit held united states v zamarripa 905 f 2d 337 page 342 1989 case tenth circuit one heres go heres one question one two stated reasons departure invalid case must remanded resentencing reviewing court cannot determine whether departure would resulted absent improper factor consequently vacate sentence those plus stephenson theres one case i want give i close thing case decided court sentencing guideline outside one united states v misstreata 109 supreme court 647 652 court stated following the sentence reform act 1984 makes sentencing commission guidelines binding courts although preserves judge discretion depart guidelines applicable particular case judge finds aggravating mitigating factor present commission adequately consider formulating formulating guidelines in words saying determined guidelines binding court aggravating mitigating circumstance regard factor sentencing commission consider creating guidelines permits departure in words departure based something outside factor considered determined guidelines done arrests resulting convictions strictly considered decided sentencing guidelines convictions 15 years old thing thats considered part guidelines the way according misstreata make departure factors relying considered guidelines thats 2 thats 2 thats 3742f2 if considered cant make departure case thats good opinion opinion entire court entire one dissent solid opinion they followed case these factors determined considered sentencing guidelines misstreata final word i would say particular situation ill save time i reply sir i agree im going win case first youve got case record right misstreata case went court sentencing guidelines language opinion says sentencing reform act 1984 makes sentencing commission guidelines binding courts although preserves judge discretion depart guidelines applicable particular case judge finds aggravating mitigating factor present commission adequately consider formulating guidelines both factors considered guidelines arrests resulting convictions convictions 15 years old they defined things ordinarily usable properly usable situation i sure here say guidelines 4a11a certain prior sentences counted counted certain conditions heres say a sentence imposed 15 years prior defendants commencement incident offense counting unless defendants incarceration extended 15year period if conviction 15 years old sentencing conviction extend 15year period offense offense considered thats theyre saying no thats theyre talking theyre talking departures sure thats youre going get including they say youre supposed both arrests 15 stephenson saying he takes point specifically stephenson he says cant incarceration case 15year period convictions past 15year level he says cant stephenson great case read on page 64 65 they go well sentence well thats basic overall thing yeah well i think read stephenson read misstreata two ways youre going get information properly determine upward departure both factors relies sentenced upward departure pardon sure theyre well not but ones using used court make upward departure arent proper and another thing 3741 37421 clearly states result incorrect application guidelines stephenson exactly says type thing convictions 15 years old incorrect application guidelines he says right opinion there doubt thats decided now thats circuit court decision you get misstreata courts decision theyre saying way make departure guidelines considered issues they considered issues you got go guideline says thats theyre getting arrests resulting convictions convictions 15 years considered but youre going say wait minute wait minute i dont follow where i say i say you mean case what say i understand youre getting thats seventh circuit youre talking what conviction well thats use words thats theyre saying but wrong yes sir i yes thats position whole case i think misstreata decision court completely dispositive issue they determine things considered guidelines making upward departure havent done the honorable court adjourned tuesday next ten oclock,469.0,593,29,well hear argument next no 906297 joseph williams united states spectators admonished talk leave courtroom the court remains session mr hanson do think indication record trial judge would given lower sentence considered arrest record and trial judge the trial judge also said court well aware fact prior arrest record shall considered well seventh circuit reviewed determined i guess thought sentence reasonable right that sentence given reasonable even though misapplication guidelines regard prior arrest record well i thought i thought seventh circuit remand found reasonable didnt remand isnt right all right so im trying find theory court well would seventh circuit affirm satisfied district court would imposed lower sentence absent factors satisfied district court would imposed sentence anyway is need remand clear record sentence would imposed well assumption clear record sentence would imposed whats need remand well always harmless error analysis dont or appellate courts well situation court said i considering arrests fact sentence would exactly even i didnt consider arrests in words i kind throwing thats im im dispositive fact i would come conclusion without you would perfect harmless error situation wouldnt well refer case though think harmless error analysis would appropriate instance why okay but isnt go ahead i going say didnt cite us statute instead opinion i mean statute says imposed violation law imposed result incorrect application guidelines must remand sentencing suppose well says but also says imposed result now whose whose burden show sentence imposed result incorrect application its appeals isnt well three factors court mentioned cant show without one incorrect one wouldnt sentence you dont dont know and burden show sentence result havent made case so get f1 youre f2 youd say outside without factor maybe outside applicable guideline range unreasonable and i gather thats court decided whether unreasonable but know result improper factor do know why it mentioned factor number others it might without factor burden show result incorrect application but factors factors court appeals relied among factors district court referred youve got two questions mr hanson why dont answer justice scalias first answer justice blackmuns im sorry the court says elsewhere record replete convictions even count 5 felony convictions court belief 10 points assessed insufficient 5 felonies 2 outside 15year parameters you agree would different case mentioned one erroneous factor along two valid factors thats still case i mean thats case lets assume are cited brief mr hanson we perhaps rely very well mr hanson ms wax well hear im trying save time chief justice i take complete disagreement law says ms wax you say convictions 15 years old cannot basis departure well considered regular regular level but basis departure regular level theyre talking departures do think particular question within scope question raised certiorari you posed us question whether sentence must remanded resentenced improper proper factors relied well thats question i dont know decide one right case were improper think both improper all improper well know court appeals said those older 15yearold convictions could considered didnt challenge petition certiorari you didnt say the court appeals held district court properly relied old convictions thats specifically held you didnt challenge yes right yes indeed thats said well i wonder challenged raised question didnt challenge holding court appeals yes they said said cannot say consideration two convictions part overall assessment defendants criminal background inappropriate you did say fair question presented sentencing commission determined arrests resulting convictions convictions 15 years old considered determining defendants criminal history category should court permit district judge use information departing upward harsher sentence and rephrase brief you rephrase question brief thank mr hanson the case submitted,993.0,1334,22,mr chief justice may please court perhaps best begin language statute in subsection e section 3742 title 18 told reviewing sentence including specific case sentence departs guideline appellate court must determine whether sentence imposed result incorrect application guidelines case departures whether sentence unreasonable in words court must ask number questions was departure guidelines did district court make error applying guidelines course departure decision can determined misapplication guidelines responsible departure impermissible consideration cause sentencing decision and finally resulting sentence unreasonable under subsection f court determines sentence imposed result misapplication guidelines must remand sentence if court cannot make affirmative determination basis record go consider whether sentence departure decision depart degree departure reasonable regard remaining valid reasons given court also record whole now case departures guidelines system makes lot sense a court authorized depart guidelines circumstancing circumstances surrounding crime indicate severity criminal conduct reflected guidelines under statute sentencing courts required give reasons departing guidelines often district judges cite one reason departing guidelines also many occasions uncommon judges make mistakes explaining reasons departure some factors cite may valid grounds departure others may valid it also uncommon however departure decisions might call overdetermined decisions that often judge enough reason decide depart guidelines reasons mentioned actually essential decision depart now given situation means practice every mistake judge court makes deciding depart guidelines actually issue sentence needs corrected if congress rule effect automatic reversal rule whereby every error judge makes course applying guidelines making decision depart requires automatic remand practice would result lot useless remands if three bad means satisfies e2 then judge make decision depart result yes and wouldnt go evaluate reasonableness case we disagree your honor think record bears us we cite several passages certainly would support courts determining likely court would given sentence thats court really required determine go reasonableness evaluation well read result language mean effect cause sense judge would given decision would given sentence judge considered factor there way seeing judge consider reason if asked judge made decision considering might give three reasons but doesnt mean court said price waterhouse said exactly if ask decision maker would give reasons doesnt mean one reason isolate cause result reason because result inquiry actually looks decision maker makes decision would done decision maker could done record reasonableness looks factors another decision maker might able look cant get point make determination judge court based say would done its hypothetical exercise its thought experiment we understand analysis requires us hypothesize judge would done had regard improper reasons thats sort thought experiment court engages time it title vii it cases determined decisions many different reasons given decide illegitimate reason invalid reason really one responsible decision decision would different without thats well your honor i dont think thats value thats stake also important point that value much important sentencing reform act now possible appellate courts effect substantively review sentences for appellate courts evaluate objective legitimacy sentences really apart yeah theyve got much narrower district court well thats true and first part test looks sentencing court actually least sense positive determination sentencing court would done differently send back now cant make positive determination effect congress said well cant make positive determination dont really care going mind district court it may possible district court would done differently sent back possible isnt good enough now appellate court going step going limited circumstance effect step shoes sentencing court make decision whether departure reasonable conceding already passed results test must valid grounds sufficient grounds sentencing court gave well wouldnt f1 tells tells happens court actually determines sentence result misapplication guidelines right and implicitly court didnt make determination else would remanded yes you must go 2 and shows reasonable this harmful error standard thats want call thats end matter when court fails make determination lower court would done differently uncertainty resolved defendant rest correct and well 1 2 tell us what appellate court must determinations appellate court must make actions appellate court must take finds certain things f1 tells us well court finds unreasonable even though passed test 1 sentence must go back so second chance remand speak the court must remand finds departure nevertheless unreasonable even though court would given anyway so example suppose court decides factor invalid factor arrest record district court relied didnt really affect sentence court would given would made decision depart anyway and suppose court decides depart oh lets say 10 years instead 3 instead 3 months then court decide whether 10year departure reasonable now record 10year departure probably wouldnt reasonable case sentence go back so reasonableness inquiry mainly focused degree departure well many words make type determination i mean thats true well i think language fairly read involve determination court wouldnt done things differently language i referring page 82 joint appendix it says 82 joint appendix court well certainly case cite united states v franklin previous seventh circuit case taken purely objective sort appellate reweighing view right matter there question and sense parroting franklin says were recommending standard fact court disregard errors whether errors caused sentence go ahead decide whether would correct result well there language i think fairly construed made proper determination say middle paragraph 82 conclude despite error noted court correctly determined mr williams criminality reflected properly criminal history category goes decision depart so read effect saying setting aside error noted court made correct determination depart thats one possible way reading well examining factors part deciding whether misapplication actually affected decision part reasonableness inquiry its part first inquiry well true were exactly recommending harmless error standard chalk careless vocation precisely the decision well one careful the statute says needs affirmative determination decision would different thats different harmless error a harmless error determination would something like court must decide that court would would made would made different decision its difference uncertainty resolved well five felonies two beyond 15year period where reading well your honor lets get one thing straight in deciding depart allowed use two convictions outside 15year range that proper ground decision depart so proper ground yes yes so he wrong under guidelines 4a13 specifically says judge may use convictions counted actual criminal history score deciding depart guidelines factors demonstrate judge criminal history score doesnt properly take account severity record exactly and thats thats valid ground court appeals found right and fact passage youre reading page 53 joint appendix anything helps us because effect court saying looking five felonies including valid ground departure alone conclude 10 points isnt enough and next paragraph mentions prior arrest record without missing beat says know cant rely prior arrest record guidelines under 4a13 says spells valid ground departure think record say confidence court would done thing never taken note arrest record yes your honor the court appeals quite reasonably concluded wouldnt take much right from upper sentence 24 ceiling sentence 24 ceiling 27 court decided sentence top guidelines range now said sensible system appellate review its pragmatic system 44000 sentences year doled sentencing reform act congress could logically interest remanding lot sentences fact legitimate valid perfectly good justification guidelines record im sorry dont we know almost three times many downward departures upward departures and rules reading 3742 recommending quite evenhanded downward upward departures tends minimize number mandatory remands and course government appealing downward departures interest maximizing number mandatory remands right well yes congress could designed system like didnt well right it designed sort hybrid system the first question sentence result incorrect application guidelines determine once answer court evaluate reasonableness departure actually given nothing statute prevents court appeals juncture looking record whole maybe perhaps looking things your honor reading 3742 court appeals could it may well tempting there court appeals done right if sentence wholly product invalid factors even 18 valid factors court could relied go back thats not decision depart right right we no if they talk reasonableness okay once decide definitely case district court would done something different okay realm well might done something different really sure sure degree departure proper exactly right there two groups cases remand two separate stages inquiry the ones result misapplication ones unreasonable and ones affirmed if court questions,565.0,879,31,ms wax sentencing judge says reason i departing guidelines higher level b c b c three bad as result that would satisfy but side says thats occurred you disagree well wait theres difference occurred result i mean i say occurred result mistake court would done thing even without mistake arent two separate questions i dont want know result even though would reached result means fact result mistake and thats statute says if result now maybe would gotten place anyway hell remand it seems statute says result even conceivable reason might get anyway thats i asked first question ms wax youre saying inconsistent answer if believe youre saying seems ought say even though judge says i giving additional three points b c even though b c bad would still inquire whether wasnt material would led conclusion anyway but answer categorical if gives wrong reasons say goes back automatically now which right lets assume accept argument isnt fair say one values want preserve value kind active informed discretion part trial judges and thats want want assurance resulting sentence really result judges expert informed discretion dont give benefit doubt defendant case hypothesis give send back simply preserve value theyve got much narrower range discretion hasnt eliminated entirely ms wax f1 sufficient case could take statute because cite f2 brief seems f1 would sufficient result want maybe im incorrect it tells remand so must go 2 but 2 help i take dont think unreasonable so 2 applicable but get 2 once find unreasonable relevant pardon find reasonable relevant well ill study it still seems section 1 would adequate section have go beyond somewhat beyond statutory language anyway order reach result harmless error so i dont see 2 helps may i get may i ask question ms wax i understand argument sure fits seventh circuit case case seventh circuit make determination 1 your opponent says even i dont think would argue determine imposed result what go right reasonableness inquiry decide thought reasonable they make decision thought district court would imposed sentence do think analysis adequate all talk reasonable on page ms wax before read keep mind language bottom 81 sentence may upheld proper factors standing alone would justify departure i take mean opinion would justify departure so dont defend rationale seventh circuit what language used and said top 82 said therefore shall examine factors district court considered deciding depart upward so say enough factors court made correct decision even error and court court heads paragraph harmless error that section entitled harmless error well i know say court decided decision would handed anyway thats said well thats isnt harmless error a brand the statute doesnt say ms wax i mean thats want say decision wouldnt different the statute says decision must result now decision could result improper factors even though judge decide might decide way would still result improper factors things considered and i want tell record indication factors used three point departure were improper factors what factors use threepoint departure improper factors the things i see five felonies two beyond 15year period thats improper isnt two five thats says record thats says record anyway he says record replete convictions where reading its 53 chief justice the record replete convictions even count five felony convictions court belief 10 points assessed insufficient five felonies two outside 15year parameters now hes using five felonies improper factor really three within know considering and thing using arrests shouldnt considering so factors said relying bad factors but want us say well thats right cause result improper incorrect application sentencing guidelines going ask would judge even though result make thing would come way i dont think thats proper reading statute once find result result period thats end that proper factor all right your colleague saying and court appeals said cannot say consideration two convictions part overall assessment inappropriate they said previous arrests without convictions proper what amount departure ms wax 3 months thats 3 months upper reach though isnt do figures many appealed ms wax factors court appeals talked factors judge relied upon departure now court appeals says well factors record judge didnt say relying judges job well well use factors say factors judge didnt rely ample basis departure i take youre urging saying court appeals affirmed case well i know theres doubt court appeals says b c district court relied shouldnt error district judge committed error relying particular factors and without factors relied sufficient court appeals view actually relied but say factors record would convince us sentence proper all right thats i wanted know youre youre deciding case we agree the court appeals cant dream one district court didnt rely may i sure i something clearly mind under however come result whether say defendant prove result government burden establishing sentence would imposed anyway still true first thing court appeals answer result inquiry and they dont get reasonable test and case answer result least one could read opinion answered inquiry you think i understand but they really didnt talk reasonableness and talk reasonableness its f1 oh i see so youre saying defendant really two chances winning one proving result alternatively saying unreasonable okay i understand thank ms wax mr hanson rebuttal you 7 minutes remaining mr hanson i gather ms wax win case show factor let get lectern okay im just,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-2,-11,349.0,-96.0

bankers trust co they claim bankers trust co the thing claim socalled buyers record arnold fowler deceit breach contract malpractice whatever else could think those parties turn asserted third party

representation closing room clients representative franklin national bank expended sum 156000 yes the plaintiffs affidavit part record it appears part record affirmative representation made representative bankers trust co i understand court bound facts record but whatever worth i make affirmative representation i affidavit file effect the affidavit obtained record filed court the plaintiffs’ affidavit judge pollack yes it included record court do mean complaint allowed amend the answer yes affidavit alleges affirmative representation page 110 yes sir yes page 110 i quote language exactly “we informed attorneys believe good meritorious cause action defendants federal deposit insurance corporation europeanamerican bank well franklin national bank” i skip b “against bankers trust co withheld vitally material information us representatives informed actually misrepresented securities question genuine fact not” by representative “bankers trust co withheld vitally material information us representatives” yes sir right yes we denied opportunity i mentioned amend complaint affirmatively allege we opportunity there three reasons court affirm second circuit’s decision in first place clear whatever plaintiffs may understood transaction meant they say lenders they understood lenders but document record indicates relationship arnold fowler appears page 49 record i would call your honor’s attention language letter “your participation purchase” says mr arnold mr mallis “your advance 156000 toward purchase price” “your participation trade” “your investment” finally “you reimbursed” a loan presupposes repaid but nowhere letter say i think member court would grant summary judgment arnold fowler theory received loan mallis kates it seems borrow money neither mallis kates lender i think early conclude position certainly conclusively assume lenders rather participants trade let us assume moment lenders if court said starting point determination standing sue rule 10b5 statute statute says fraud made “in connection with” sale trigger 10b5 liability of course sale the reason case perhaps little confusing sandwiched release one pledge creation another pledge but pledge mallis kupferman simultaneous purchase arnold fowler indeed purchasers i draw attention fact arnold signed purchase agreement signed attorney that representative capacity now could sale except fact mallis kupferman came money representative course closing at closing money expended sale took place yes exactly right no not bankers trust i claim bankers trust seller i believe mere release pledge sale i believe bankers trust seller i believe within meaning act i believe seller the next question plaintiffs connected they advanced closing 86 purchase price stock received closing things sold they connected arnold arnold put less 24 purchase price there could sale without use funds closing they directly intimately connected sale to say imposed upon “in connection with” words statute sale make mockery statute calls yes i think extent second circuit said release bankers pledge sale stock i think necessary decision i think required do i think thought sale i think i think decision would way strictly basis finding plaintiffs buyers within meaning statute yes absolutely no i think right i say sale occurs identical time pledge pledge connection sale you cannot sale without pledge how i view whether pledge sale i think necessary i disagree court appeals i think necessary reach conclusion whether every pledge ipso facto constitutes sale within meaning securities exchange act i think court appeals thought i necessarily defend conclusion i know somehow somewhere i know exactly fraudulent securities pledged pledgee i know somewhere comes time pledgee standing sue violation rule 10b5 mr justice rehnquist asked question course mr weiner’s argument would happen note given stock given back exchange my time and mr weiner responded would answer would occasion go 10b5 remedy but suppose example note forgery fellow sent along collateral denied liability although conceding signed stock whatever purpose the bank would foreclosed suing debt would foreclosed suing 10b5 farfetched possibility positively specifically yes the plaintiffs new pledgee yes i say sale pledgee generates use funds sufficient supply statutory requirement “in connection with” sale no i think i thought i minutes left yes your honor mr pitt referred phrase “interest” definition sale that 1934 act that 1933 act the 1934 act clearly speaks sale disposition thereof that one point the second point important substantial difference buying stock make collateralized loan making collateralized loan the lending factor sought stress earlier based general credit individual they looking value collateral the gil films case first time sec really pushed question whether pledge sale 1960 professor loss refers case in case sham transaction pure bona fide pledge expanded question therein now one factors really very important lot stated beyond record subsequent i would like clarify facts come attention result state court action we completed deposition mr fowler in examination mr fowler makes clear number one aware conflict and arnold fully aware conflict equity national industries kates’ yes i recognize sir but numerous allegations totally without merit i would like court remember that correct and whether “in connection with” because court appeals speaks and whether “in connection with” also that subsidiary question also honor thank you,497.0,634,49,we hear arguments next 1359 bankers trust mallis kupferman mr weiner may proceed whenever ready do say simple i read briefs case week ago airplane i thought i going crazy i thought altitude getting we hesitate counsel let isolate i may first part transaction described bankers trust received pledge georgia bank okay mr kates would far say mr kates made fraudulent representation respect value securities pledging bankers trust bankers trust alleged relied representation bankers trust would 10b5 action kates could could proceed you certainly could proceed note 10b5 could proceed virtue fraudulent representation connection pledge virtue 10b5 i asking need i asking whether would available management changed new management thought need is position simply would sale action that i trying find not right there mr kupferman somewhere mr weiner particular sale would concede sale within meaning statute sale kates arnold fowler your position pledges connection sale release pledge mr weiner would make difference bank introduced parties known details would relevance legal issue then dwell facts they go whether “in connection with” fraud do purposes decision assume bankers life committed kind fraud connection sale mr weiner talk act i take talking securities exchange act 1944 i looked complaint action seems brought securities act 1933 it clear around complaint 1934 act and rule 10b5 promulgated statute the complaint indicate mr weiner contend difference meaning word “sale” ’33 act ’34 act they use word “pledge” it pretty hard would it pretty hard say pledge disposition interest securities in event dealing ’34 and rule 10b5 promulgated there statutory definition sale right do i correctly read second circuit opinion relying cases arose chiefly ’33 act rather ’34 act where much broader definition sale mr warden he denied lease amend you cannot file motion discovery received permission file amended complaint and denied lease amend so cannot complain lack discovery coming back gigantic fraud talking much involved litigation pending new york state torts when said knew trouble mean knew pledge taken security likely worthless is record the fact made representation alleged is affidavit record you mean affidavit judge pollack the plaintiffs’ affidavit judge pollack is included does include representation bankers trust representation no affidavit judge pollack where this judge pollack what say what referring told it would help i know thing we started “we informed” ended “we informed” i understood say affidavit said positively bankers trust said good where that information that good mr hauser sale describing sale kates not bankers trust that right you claim release pledge sale so say bankers trust seller does second circuit opinion seem disagreement whether release pledge sale bankers trust do think thought i know think thought holding essential decision this release connection sale your position fraudulent representation someone seller actionable 10b5 but necessary claim us agree pledge sale because say sale took place release connection sale how view question whether pledge sale is pledge sale you disagree court appeals you would suggest court appeals think necessary decision hold pledge sale but necessarily defend conclusion i would interested hear would say your position i take rely sale arnold mallis misrepresentation made bankers trust connection sale that would protect new pledgee could new pledgee recover yes i know but buyers you said need hold buyers let us assume buyers pledge sale purchase the new pledgee buyer get stock seller bankers seller either makes misrepresentation connection sale the new pledgee recover that certainly theory court appeals mr pitt yes four minutes left that goes merits controversy that part us all pleadings and fairly precise issue whether pledge sale within meaning ’34 act what confused brief talking pledge kates bankers trust release pledge sec talking quite different pledge they talking one arnold fowler made mallis kupferman equity national stock i know makes case actually confusing but single issue rather precise one nothing merits thank gentlemen the case submitted,1239.0,1692,0,mr chief justice may please court the principle proposition decisive case fact words “purchase” “sale” used 1934 act ordinary words teachings court must therefore accorded commonly accepted meanings those commonly accepted meanings include pledge transaction that pledging securities property release pledge purchase sale involve transfer ownership consideration a pledge transfer ownership general property interest pledged property i might say point response mr justice stewart’s question earlier statutory definition include pledge public utility holding company act 1935 its inclusion submit shows congress wants impose upon common word purchase sale artificial special meaning avoid repetition lengthy number terms order achieve purposes statute knows perfectly well there indication legislative history otherwise either 1933 act 1934 act intended regulate credit transactions ordinary course business facetoface basis as professor loss pointed criticizing even gil films decision ’33 act federal law required deal individual loan transactions what congress concerned regulation primary secondary public securities markets country the statutes drafted course cover personally negotiated purchases sales point made sec brief that quite true the statute drafted cover that indicates congress attempt draw line public trading insecurities private purchases sales securities but deal purchases sales regulation credit transactions the court appeals sec brief suggested ordinary meaning purchase sale disregarded statutory definition says sale includes contract sell otherwise dispose there nothing legislative history indicates addition words “or otherwise dispose off” intended take away core meaning word “sale” in fact pointed brief strict definition word “sale” obtained time involved transfer ownership price paid money the words” otherwise dispose off” extend definition word “sale” exchange barter transaction case held sec national securities statutory merger fact exchange ownership consideration money to attempt read anything words without warrant legislative history engage construction speculation mr justice stewart i think would probably sufficient purchase sale ordinary informal sense that i said someone “i sell part interest 100 shares general motors i own” said “fine i pay 1000 that” i took i think would purchase sale within meaning statute i think transfer books transfer agent turning shares get 250 share certificates would required well your honor i think anything done alleged done bankers trust case connection transaction plaintiffs complain that transaction mr weiner pointed entirely arranged closing occurred offices bankers trust i might point that one aspects case serious concern banking community quite common thing banks maintain conference rooms purposes closings afford use rooms customers conduct transactions if brings one’s activities disputes otherwise involve bank inhibition bank’s banking facilities available people include public interest way it quite clear reading record i happen agree justice stewart facts case rather hard understand it quite clear what supposedly constituted misrepresentation connection transaction plaintiffs complain mr justice stevens clear facts facts motion dismiss situations lot affidavits state court record transaction entirely arranged kates’ fowler arnold fowler arnold found plaintiffs bankers trust co never heard then closing occurs alleged unknown misrepresentation made closing but closing ministerial proceeding that court appeals decision says that court ruled i think indicate your honor quite right that court appeals decision says court must assume but i think entirely different point i making talk kind pretty cheap conference room transactions occur instruments passed across title easy someone allege allegation way three years state court complaint dismissed allegation misrepresentation made case made information three years case thrown state court proceeding decide whether misrepresentation way “in connection with” what misrepresentation could “in connection with” either bankers trust would considered seller court appeals handled problem saying release pledge sale explication all release pledge performance duty imposed bank law payment loan somehow would finding bankers trust aider abettor court expressly reserved blue chip stamps question whether civil liability aiding abetting 10b5 one bridges would crossed order make misrepresentation court must assume existed i quite agree your honor i think questions law whether release pledge sale 10b question law i submit answer whether civil liability aiding abetting 10b5 question law then question answered affirmative plaintiff would free attempt prove aiding abetting that correct honor that correct mr chief justice it position statutes face history passed regulate credit transactions loan whether secured stock property remains loan sec contends investment securities thank mr chief justice may please court i think analysis court appeals respect pledge sale correct we take position whether release stock respect natural fulfillment pledge agreement sale purposes act petitioners argue irrelevant i think opinion stands analytically without holding it may well judges second circuit concerned finding completed transaction sale purchase i think brief attempts demonstrate analytically sale respect pledge transaction i would agree i would also say juncture concern release securities pledge transaction although conceivable possibility circumstances fraud may induced holder collateral might actionable that correct i think gotten away privity mr rehnquist’s decision blue chip stamps case court specifically referred fact 10b5 gone light years away if i may honor release sale occurred arnold fowler pledged stock mallis kupferman bankers trust affirmatively made misrepresentation plaintiffs that correct court need focus except far may concerned motivation bankers trust alleged pleadings courts definitely we talking solely pledge arnold fowler mallis induced bankers trust’s affirmative misrepresentation alleged papers court proceeding pardon your honor precisely second circuit holding respect side transaction that pledge the second circuit also felt appropriate but analytically bankers trust satisfied legal terms contract kates it arguable that release deemed sale that concern case issue think court if i given impression yet third theory i must apologize i believe theory espoused wholly consistent second circuit’s decision analytically i would submit that irrelevant decision i would like explain i would like explain i may the fraud occurred connection misrepresentation made mallis pay funds sufficient accomplish purchase upon induced rely investment value securities served collateral loan transaction if fraud court must assume based procedural posture case mallis kupferman taking stock defrauded based investment value stock it matters prior transaction bankers trust released stock kates kates could give arnold fowler that really irrelevant fraud case we relying 110 i understand no 110 affirmative misrepresentations yes what else we relying solely fact motion dismiss could pleaded information belief this honor your honor i understand procedures occurred judge pollack instituted motion dismiss suggestion connection refused allow amendment complaint however decision dismissing complaint indicated would deem complaint favorably alleged section 10b rule 10b5 he effectively extrapolated materials court deemed amendment still dismissed but denied formal leave amend complaint except motion dismiss i sorry except dismissal action that may your honor no although i think case tried one allegations plaintiffs appeared making bankers realizing defective set securities collateral anxious deliberately misrepresented value stock could get bad transaction in sense i think might relevant but course speculation juncture that precisely hearing extent i must say respectfully brothers that precisely position analytically would affect allegation fraud case i quite agree indeed i may assert think issue would assert person deceived parting money exchange interest securities precisely type situation federal securities laws antifraud protection intended apply there must disposition interest sale that correct yes we taken position since late 1950s we filed number lawsuits we number cases set forth amicus brief court we articulated certain cases we exempted pledge transactions would otherwise included within definition sale indeed petitioners take comfort surprisingly us rule 16a6 specifically felt need exempt pledge operative term “sale” purposes rule encompass pledges special limited circumstance but otherwise taken position consistently since 1950s if something specific pledges i must confess i unaware your honor i occasion coming today review amicus brief superintendent insurance case court expressly held shareholders creditors specifically within intendment securities exchange act protections antifraud in brief cite legislative history rather defused i cannot tell expressed references pledged transactions but talked value securities held banks value securities held insurance companies massive loans utilized i would point court section 2 securities exchange act talks making preserving investment decision investors reasonably complete effective antifraud provisions i think question securities exchange act covers situation investment tent investment interest i think would anomalous suggest someone puts 156000 largely reliance underlying value securities takes possession securities that constitute investment decision court national securities talked terms definition sale blue chip talked terms limited coverage exemptions court applied recently if i may i two responses first course i guess case ample evidence fact sophisticated investors find position but importantly i think question prior question focus legitimate concern securities exchange commission that concern deals fact securities pledged next step pledged securities foreclosed upon they become distributed marketplace the enforcement actions referred shown organized crime many individuals using pledge transactions means circumvent rules some cases had knowing schemes direction banks may participants victims in addition i think fair point although banks court faced today assert would like protections act many cases banks sought protections section 10b rule 10b5 kinds situations there smaller banks larger banks many including exchange national bank billiondollar transaction opinion written judge friendly recently protections section 10b rule 10b5 eagerly sought banking institutions in particular situation i agree justice powell unusual situation bank alleged made affirmative misrepresentation i grant record weak i grant fact trial case may prove that concern juncture i taught thing honor i wish complaint specific i would hope i hope honor i would suggest make statutory determination farreaching ramifications private litigants government commission civil enforcement actions justice department criminal actions hopefully poor pleading fact case upset important statutory protection think needs   no if i said i apologize i thought i asked whether specific references pledge transactions legislative history as specific reference pledge transactions i aware as loan credit agreements importance providing protections securities laws context i think ample legislative history some cited superintendent insurance amicus brief court i think court’s decision superintendent insurance amply supports conclusion particularly footnote 8 page 12 reported decision consistently one minor exception since commenced raising issue started late 1950s in late 1950s second fifth seventh tenth circuits acknowledged pledges sales under acts in one case i believe fifth circuit erroneous interpretation limitation pledge could sale but understanding circuits held least ’33 act i sure i think one case ’34 act downum case cite alleged 10b5 violation ’34 act well if i may respect court said mr justice marshall’s opinion national securities well hawk felder decision interpretation ’33 ’34 act construed para materia complimenting ends toward comprehensive scheme regulation nation’s securities trading activities,417.0,513,25,do think transfer title speak transfer ownership mr warden phrase “in connection with” mr warden quite correct i understood mr weiner agree must assume bank charged fraud accept case that something making conference room available if fraud objectify is alleged assume purpose decision may proved ultimately closing bankers trust made fraudulent misrepresentation we assume purposes decision that different making conference room available mr warden may weak case nothing legal question supposed decide but matters resolved later stage proceeding justice stevens suggested in words saying i take court appeals read 1934 act definitions would arrived results matter law and would dealt facts mr hauser do think mr pitt court appeals opinion stands independent analysis discussing you think court appeals need say do think little chance disagree court appeals whether release sale little chance remanded would come way in view bankers liability rest finding made misrepresentation connection sale seller what sale say release connection new pledge so connection new pledge say made misrepresentation so talking pledge kates bankers trust release bankers trust collateral again quite deviation second circuit’s reasoning is quite deviation reasoning second circuit that pledge that release kates bankers trust collateral sale said then third theory support 10b5 liability ie bankers trust’s made misrepresentation connection sale b bankers trust x that theory passed brother i understood it it brothers i say i say us question whether release pledge sale the second circuit said sustainable might get one result case might get another i know already submitted mr pitt bankers trust paragraph page 110 anything show implication also relying one paragraph informants and else and else all i trying get that denial motion amend motion dismiss according court appeals judgment district court a motion judgment they say every good case requires mystery document in case missing document judgment mr pitt i take said would made difference position whether ever pledge bankers release bankers is correct that goes merits case the question whether purchase sale within meaning ’34 act 10b5 as brother powell suggested question wholly interdependent whether ever pledge case bankers trust bankers trust could held securities safekeeping ever received pledge but sale and pledge arnold mallis kupferman sale theory may i ask entirely i interrupted how long sec taken position take today pledge sale have issued release effect is anything legislative history either act ’33 ’34 supports position pledge sale the hearings led acts extensive dealt sorts problems relating securities i would curious i would thought gotten business lending money putting collateral congress intended deal mr pitt connection transaction quite extraordinary it rare private individuals lend sort money the securities acts concerned primarily i thought protecting unsophisticated investors here dealing primarily banks lending institutions definition sophisticated investors the acts certainly designed primarily protect i suppose would agree if foreclosed securities registered subject provisions act ’33 this bank planning protections act the banks situation going defendants plaintiffs i told pleading plead something like fraud would specific the difference i stick teaching left mr pitt i understand say justice powell case authority

bargaining agreement racial discrimination limited benefits blacks whites would reviewable anywhere federal law you mean violation fair representation but say 302 would relevance so answer 302 remedy situation like that submission thank gentlemen the case submitted,1425.0,1546,22,mr chief justice may please court important outset note limits case the trustees concede three important points first trustees concede trustees formulated provision would reviewable indeed disagreement among lower courts courts power review eligibility provisions formulated trustees section 302 prohibits trustees formulating eligibility provisions would deny coverage persons substantial contributory work histories granting benefits persons lesser contributory work histories unless rational nexus provision valid purpose 302 trust that issue never court however case nlrb versus amax court noted fiduciary duties placed i dont believe court ever said duties reviewable i believe amax case talks differences bargaining representatives trustees yes indeed we take position trustees duties reviewable thats correct i dont think doubt cases trustees actions reviewable i think lower federal courts dealt issue whether trustee formulated eligibility provisions arbitrary consistently held provisions cannot exclude persons contributory work histories substantial unless rational nexus provision except one maybe congress shown enacting erisa provided trustees follow trust documents insofar trust documents cause breach fiduciary duty and trustees concede second point respondents husbands quit work filed applications retirements instead continuing work contributory work widows would granted benefit the third point trustees not persons respondents class some would no the referring death benefit provided family active worker an active worker regardless long worked mines whether 20 years one day passed away actively employed payment if eligible the trustees effect concede provision arbitrary they tendered justification provision collectively bargained in fact question provision arbitrary the arbitrariness shown looking hypothetical twin brothers you could one brother could go work noncontributory mine work 19 years noncontributory mine work one year contributory employment retired drawn benefits number years died that brothers widow would receive permanent health care coverage if twin brother could worked 19 years contributory mine even worked last year noncontributory mine know died without retiring brother worked 19 years contributory employment family would receive absolutely nothing death benefits widow would receive health benefits whatsoever yes the contract provides widow pensioner upon pensioners death received 2000 the widow active miner time death happened working union mine regardless whether pensioneligible would receive 5000 it funeral payment in fact facts case show arbitrariness situation juanita hagers husband worked time teenager mines he worked 39 years coal mines the last 24 years worked contributory employer and yet juanita hager denied benefit mr hager still working contributory employment time died filed application likewise gracie robinsons husband worked 30 years coal mines the last 21 years life spent working contributory coal mine paying funds and yet widows denied benefit provided widows whose husbands little one year contributory service throughout litigation trustees shown justification provision rational nexus purpose fund exclusion instead say collectively bargained immune judicial review issue whether mere collective bargaining provision immunize judicial review issue case this case presents narrow set circumstances well contented judicial review clearly authorized without judicial review beneficiaries funds would way protection we contend that authority within section 302 tafthartley within cases interpreted provision when congress enacted section 302 concerned earned contributions workers could arbitrarily disposed unions unless protection control funds congress 1947 saw potential abuse whenever unions control trust funds provided would review funds would become union war chest without 302s protections eligibility decisions could made solely terms unions benefit manner beneficiaries benefit so congress intended 302 remedial provided private cause action enforced rights could workers could protect rights subsequent section 302s enactment numerous federal court cases ruled eligibility provisions section 302 trust cannot arbitrary cannot exclude persons substantial contributory work histories time granting benefits similarly situated persons lesser contributory work histories unless trustees show rational nexus provision valid purpose fund reward workers contributory work it important note congress added number amendments section 302c5 years even though two decades court decisions imposed trusts arbitrary prohibition prohibition cannot arbitrary provisions trust there nothing legislative history show know substantive requirements far many years work anything along lines legislative intent show congress couched section 302 trust terms workers would protected the sole exclusive benefit language shows congress wanted funds used benefit workers benefit union we contend evidence case shows one example judicial review trust trust could used union benefits clear negotiations case collective bargainers concerned merits classes they concerned as matter fact even consider class instead union insisting upon one groups inclusion concerned vocal group wanted benefits certain group considered group compromise item vocal group for instance one memorandum drawn negotiations concerning i think example benefits widows active miners regardless years service say umwa sees compromise possible views potentially dangerous postratification issue especially southern west virginia  and importance certain groups union concerned could wildcat strikes things would embarrass union yes we challenging fact benefits provided widows miners would working future we would case granting provision benefits widows men quit work past the benefits provided 1950 benefit plan widows pensioners and providing benefits then would situation case then would case but facts case different they grant coverage similarly situated widows whose husbands insignificant years contributory work history they granted widows retirees passed away prior negotiations the trustees contend that would even reviewable we contend that would lawful distinctions persons receive benefits persons denied benefits must drawn rational basis if benefits going denied persons massive contributory work histories many years working contributing work employment time granting persons lesser work histories must rational nexus shown there must purpose trust fund would furthered provision well cases shown mere saving money justification if restriction regardless arbitrary would justified it also interesting note various court cases held judicial review eligibility provisions congress enact erisa erisa enacted time well established judicial review eligibility provisions formulated trustees yet erisa left section 302c5 effect erisa effect codified strengthened sole exclusive benefit standard courts interpreted 302c5 prohibit type arbitrary capricious provisions the congress concerned enacting 302c5 fact workers contributions could subject union manipulations evidence case show that indeed possibility whenever negotiators involved area protection judicial review the trustees position rules unreviewable bear rational nexus valid purpose 302 fund position would open door unions manipulations funds would allow unions accomplish bargaining table would unlawful accomplish trustees would leave retirees widows totally unprotected trustees argument eligibility provisions could drawn benefit workers benefit union the collective bargaining provision afford protections active worker required section 302c5 the trustees argument concerning allied chemical workers correct case involve situation parties forced bargain impasse the collective bargainers case freely undertook create section 302 trust we contend created 302 trust created creature federal law trust must comply federal law under erisa suit brought trustees also trust thats correct justice white we feel trustees situation could sued ask declaratory judgment the wage agreement case trust documents justice white provide trustees reform trusts comply federal law trustees reform trust comply court decisions we contend against even district judge gesell we contend apparent trustees provision arbitrary unlawful could gone back settlors said arbitrary could asked declaratory judgment under trust documents provision unlawful ability change trust when brought attention could see when brought attention gracie robinson juanita hager they dont take word they go they could go court ask courts determination they could go court could go back collective bargaining they would the trust documents empower trustees reform trusts if if unlawful if could go court court determine they could could gone back collective bargainers asked then trustees asked judgment we trust documents provide also erisa provision plan sued the district court found provision contract provision trust document provided trustees empowered change trust document shown exclusion class arbitrary capricious if court determined exclusion arbitrary capricious trustees change documents the district judge concluded based fact collectively bargained therefore entitled relief he said provision result collective bargaining therefore that district court found incorrect standard apply section 302 trust the judicial review normally applied collectively bargained contracts limited judicial review the review normally applicable cases dealing issues relevant active employees now active employee many remedies many protections the active employee nlrb protections afforded duty fair representation voice union vote contract yet retiree survivor none protections for respondents class protection requirement section 302 requirement case law eligibility provisions drawn arbitrary capricious manner the testimony shows collective bargainers even consider fact men age eligible years service eligible retire retired filed applications pensions continued working past retirement age contributory employment died still actively employed there good faith active intense bargaining group there consideration cost group merits the union negotiator one union negotiators mr pearce noted tradeoff respondents class omitted merits as mentioned reason class omitted considered the union considered vocal class union thought would embarrass union ratification contract bargaining stopped class left reason whatsoever the trustees position adopted would mean provision regardless arbitrary could readopted collective bargainers would judicial immunity for instance signatory last employment requirement defendant funds invalidated roark v boyle roark v lewis trustees cases simply gone collective bargainers said court says provision arbitrary theory collective bargainers could say collective bargainers think good provision therefore courts would review whatsoever we contend that position supported case law that total abdication fiduciary duties envisioned congress enacted 302c5 envisioned congress enacted erisa absolutely support position the trustees argument cases holding 302 places restrictions trust funds mistakenly relied general equity law supported reading numerous cases circuits it clear courts held section 302 fact congress concerned persons worked contributory employment receive benefits courts held 302 supply substantive restrictions plans the trustees course argue collective bargaining imposed protections class shown way judicial review would harm collective bargaining,329.0,534,39,mr sword even though opponent concedes point response justice rehnquists question court never held assume discretion expressly given trustees collective bargaining agreement administer pension has court ever held exercise discretion trustees subject review it didnt say anything duties reviewable court performance duties reviewable court well ever said reviewable question has court ever said reviewable how amax but didnt say fiduciary duties trustees subject supervision court equity so reviewable decisions terms 302 standards well amax hardly dealt question reviewing discretion that dealt manner appointed but certainly cases around say courts may modify eligibility requirements i mean trustees may modify eligibility requirements except one maybe of course point also would gotten 5000 instead 2000 severance pay wouldnt some would wouldnt are contending that also violated agreement disparate treatment 5000 2000 others even eligible benefits well distinction arbitrary distinction 5000 2000 death benefits equally arbitrary isnt i see well isnt question rather whether immunize judicial review whether judicial review permissible authorized well doesnt answer question say someone without protection i mean judicial review you point affirmative authority courts review thing mr sword really isnt anything legislative history shows congressional intent set substantive standard eligibility retirements well isnt every indication sole exclusive benefit prevent provision legislation prevent union officials using trust funds benefit isnt really thrust legislative history right well another reason isnt the people involved people whose husbands died negotiation took place i think would normal union show greater interest current work force there would obligation provide retroactive benefits people previously died would the arbitrariness comes provided benefits but would agree could denied benefits widows previously deceased miners would case well say denied benefits widows deceased miners families retired miners current workers you wouldnt case would what found situation didnt think enough money provide benefits wanted arbitrarily said provide benefits people pennsylvania ohio tried equally benefits would small worth anything would rather substantial benefits one group others i take would illegal theory well purpose always i suppose whenever deny class benefit save little money why sue trustees though well i know solves case easily people fault settlors the union management now may right 302 fairness collective bargaining agreement adjudicated i dont know sue trustees what authority say wont enforce maybe trustees could even sued settlors why didnt sue union management agreement declared illegal federal law against against court decisions maybe court decisions union management you mean trustees suggest trustees may look trust agreement say gee think violates federal law collective bargaining agreement terms trust arent going pay benefits we going pay see fit is think i know wouldnt say could act would you mean suggest well know unlawful well by well i know take word fact illegal well whose word take well wouldnt least go court well wouldnt they could vary disregard trust instrument if illegal if illegal well know unlawful somebody decides they would wouldnt i know the collective bargainers would say sorry agreed think perfectly fair trustees would wanted vary trust document would sue well i suggest sued wrong people i dont think trustees give relief shown but district judge thought otherwise didnt he said bad bargain bargain didnt yes good bad contract your time expired mr sword do anything counsel could i ask

judgment acquittal entered district court district massachusetts the case presents double jeopardy issue arises way in november 1971 series raids socalled around suburban communities boston pursuant search warrants directed suspected bookmaking establishments the warrants issued result series wiretaps authorized district court conducted since previous june for reason i know reason 10 months later september 1972 indictment returned in particular indictment one 16 persons indicted eventually 11 tried one petitioner sanabria it onecount indictment charging violation title 18 united states code section 1955 know socalled bookie syndicate act about month indictment returned fourth circuit announced decision giordano might recall case held wiretap invalid application authorized person attorney general specially designated assistant required statute then court granted certiorari giordano in spring 1973 agreement among parties including government defendants case allowed lay dormant pending decision giordano i give history suggestion government’s brief record three four five years defense counsel finding ways attack indictment the case essentially dormant good part time eventually mid1974 i believe court upheld giordano as result many many indictments resulted raids dismissed one surviving indictments one it became immediately apparent defense counsel unless could find basis fourth amendment attack simply defense defendants there ton evidence bookmaking slips wiretaps going get evidence we come fourth amendment grounds district court see way court appeals interestingly enough filed petition certiorari held summer denied last september name plotkin petitioner i believe united states these 10 defendants convicted sanabria 11th acquitted i jumping ahead time after trial court denied motion suppress evidence realized trial going simply exercise protection defendants’ rights shortly trial began began casting around kind defense put kind plausible defense trial of course place begin statute the statute recall prohibits willfully conducting gambling business meet three criteria first violation gambling business must constitute violation state law second must involve five persons thirdly must large it must operation 30 days receive gross revenue 2000 single day an essential element offense prove gambling law alleged indictment violated state law the indictment particularized violation state law section 17 chapter 271 that section massachusetts general laws directed games like horse races political election boxing matches lottery numbers games socalled thus government prove thought prove business alleged one violation section 17 that nonnumbers type game at close government’s case put section 17 evidence way asking court take judicial notice made i might charitably call somewhat specious argument because indictment described business one registering bets technically speaking crime massachusetts law crime found place apparatus registering bets but indictment described business one registering bets described gambling business including numbers operation numbers operation crime section 17 specified indictment moved judgment acquittal as i say motion completely unsound we took wild shot district court buying at appendix page 7 find district court holding indictment effective denying judgment acquittal basis i know i never dreamed case would get far would double jeopardy plan i made specious argument moving judgment acquittal proper motion motion dismiss indictment that argument wellfounded then district court denied motion properly got serious business directing evidence case we moved page 11 i believe record strike limit numbers evidence considered first essential element crime that gambling business must violate state law case violate section 17 horseracing statute what asking court either strike numbers horseracing particularized limit numbers evidence could received description gambling perhaps go state mind defendants that professional gamblers knew not quite honor my point one statute particularized statue violation government prove particularly alleged indictment no either judge skinner trial judge recognized if simply alleged gambling business violated state law would enough i think judge skinner said government done narrowed specified section 17 stuck i really think i show i misled prejudiced part due process prove charged charge intend prove i suppose part but goes fundamental right notified crime charged at rate district court denied motion strike evidence limit defendants put evidence renewed i would call specious judgment acquittal motion denied then recess judge came back recess said done research he reconsidered motion strike alternative limit evidence decided strike numbers evidence he says page 13 “section 17 include numbers aspect i going grant motion judgment acquittal basis i grant motion strike much evidence case numbers betting” then dust cleared numbers evidence taken case became obvious evidence linking one defendant case way linking gambling business defendant petitioner sanabria i i assumed logical thing move judgment acquittal of course could done nothing permit jury return verdict guilty would judge would instruct could convict somebody connected horseracing gambling business jury would instructions done right thing i assume i think honor i thought that question could passed martin linen case decided last april court recognizes judgment acquittal equivalent directed verdict i would assume verdict i think waiver i think saving court government defense counsel personnel involved trial lot time why go empty futile gesture go empty ritual sending case jury know one conclusion arrive i would willing because i following rules i sure i way request instruction asked trial judge instruct jury convict anybody shown merely horse business would i made request instructions said “you damn foolwhy moving judgment acquittal i going send case sit around jury decides jury room evidence” he would i suppose sue sponte entered judgment acquittal i think waiving anything the judgment acquittal allowed government filed notice appeal i would say notice appeal first circuit first time time government correctly described happened says united states appeals decision order district court excluding evidence entering judgment acquittal denying motion reconsideration there motion reconsideration thereafter then second paragraph notice appeal government says hereby certified evidence suppressed constitutes substantial proof charges defendant obviously government trying fit part statute permits appeal allowance motion suppress evidence the net result really happened erroneous ruling evidence it pains say ruling erroneous i thought right i still but the first circuit decided erroneous there erroneous ruling evidence correct ruling state evidence granting motion judgment acquittal this characterization court appeals first circuit holds accurate that court holds critical ruling district court indictment failed charge violation section 1955 numbers theory that footnote 5 court’s opinion page 6 appendix petition but may please court said almost erroneous ruling excluding evidence irrelevant when court decides whether evidence admitted must necessarily interpret scope indictment if interprets scope widely permit evidence if narrows scope narrow amount evidence comes but excludes evidence basis irrelevancy exclusion appealable erroneously excluded evidence incompetent here court appeals says indictment dismissed effectively dismissed evidence excluded charge excluded it speaks excluding charge the court appeals says adapted government numbers charge discrete basis imposing criminal liability this discrete basis effectively dismissed we i respectfully consider new vocabulary introduced criminal lawindictments divided counts know law court appeals first circuit counts divided discrete basis liability i call notes dbls discrete basis liability implied counts yes if law first circuit become law land erroneous failure trial court recognize dbl resulting exclusion evidence equivalent dismissal dbl judgment results appealable course dbl what dbl discrete basis liability shorthand expression court appeals the court appeals however puts limit dbl kind theory saying dbl constitutional double jeopardy significance count duplicitous that dbl must one offenses contained indictment the government takes extreme view because government concedes first circuit error held particular indictment duplicitous must take position going claim successfully dbl theory must take position dbl must still treated separate offense purposes double jeopardy analysis even though count duplicitous so government’s definition i think possible isolate several dbls indictment one count as matter fact dbl recognition become important part skills every defense lawyer failure recognize dbl could drastic double jeopardy consequences but particular count charge defendant accepted recorded registered bets horses numbers you accepting bets numbers recording bets numbers registering bets numbers you got three dbls then got skill speed endurance horses yet accepting bets skill horse recording bets skill horse registering bets skill horse it keeps going and you might get hundreds dbls it seems going incorporate law prospective lord knows nobody really recognizes theory lawyers ought time learn dbls also district courts ought instructed liberally grant particulars i think what exclude evidence dbl he excluded numbers evidence the numbers identified dbl according court appeals by excluding evidence court appeals says effectively dismissed numbers dbl speak yes effectively dismissed that government’s position if going recognize dbl position what exclude evidence state exclusion evidence state evidence exclusion entered judgment acquittal no i think all say i going exclude numbers i going exclude evidence numbers evidence i going let evidence horses i think got problem intellectually dishonest judge least your honor i say the defendant appoint judge the government appointment it purely incompetence defense he delighted what government the evidence gets excluded erroneously correctly judgment acquittal entered on motion defendant he might say “i going let bank robbery evidence evidence incompetence it hearsay i excluding basis” he could 100 percent wrong system yes get pretty close issue yes yes i would say that best close come fong foo case also critical court appeals’ holding objection indictment trial nothing wrong indictment ten people eventually convicted indictment sanabria could convicted government way able connect gambling business defined indictment the government concedes brief support pretrial motion dismiss one mr dimento i understand law subsequently developed judge made different ruling conclusion evidence client could convicted trial numbers evidence yes so jeopardy conviction dbls yes even numbers evidence jeopardy conviction horse aspect might little evidence left connecting horses he jeopardy but government says although ground pretrial motion dismiss objected indictment beforehand i know objection rule existed government says way pointed miscitation section 37 our position miscitation section 37 perfectly valid part massachusetts statute indictment fine coherent hold i see ground type motion trial what government really saying written letter say “gentlemen think really intend charge violation section 17 also violation section 7 i think better amend indictment go back get new one able convict 10 clients sanabria told evidence engaging horse betting therefore better go back get different approach” yes it depends position in case decided indictment perfectly valid it could dismissed i moved no you speak numbers crime however though speaking separate offense no i making no your premise wrong your question got wrong premise you talking crime there numbers crime the crime violating state law the judge thought violation state law manner means numbers satisfy indictment although indictment could charged crime evidence would supported the indictment could charged crime if would written differently yes the court appeals thought indictment adequately charged crime evidence relevant yes the court appeals thought evidence relevant that issue yes i knew crime charged i knew also narrowed particularized violation horse betting finally court appeals says government adapts argument gave valued right verdict i think i covered we never thought moving exclude evidence moving judgment acquittal waiving anything giving right i see anybody fairly say decision move exclusion evidence object evidence move judgment acquittal could way constitute waiver anything valuable constitutional right twice put jeopardy crime only rule puts obligation defense counsel waste court’s time sending case jury instructions inevitably result verdict guilty i think i think i fulfilled obligation court waste time i think i made choice sense i sacrificing something client order gain benefit i simply following rules correct procedure it natural thing lawyer six months experience yes might come back verdict guilty i assume juries right thing yes that good point in case i confident jury would recognized i confident judge instructions judge instructions would explicit but nevertheless entered call judgment acquittal already ruled indictment charge crime respect numbers i like use kind phraseology i know i blame see accept mine he made determination scope indictment yes the scope indictment determined argued government i understand the court appeals however said indictment stood charged crime evidence numbers relevant yes the judge trial said “there crime charged indictment evidence relevant” so could ever acquitted crime never charged that may i respectfully say reason way i know ruling excluding evidence cannot tortured appealable result i know excluding evidence basis relevancy i ask exclusions evidence respect crimes unquestionably charged indictment i saying excluding basis relevancy once say evidence excluded irrelevant necessarily defining scope indictment it excluded irrelevant crime judge think indictment charge it excluded irrelevant charge thought indictment charge yes returning charge i certainly i intend i think carry extremes using example judge bank robbery indictment says “i going exclude evidence bank robbery” and although terribly erroneous still ,428.0,447,23,we hear arguments next 761040 sanabria united states you may proceed whenever ready mr dimento am i correct far admit started case decree condition would consider fullproof double jeopardy plan you said made specious argument i understand your point since indictment recited detail massachusetts statute thought violated necessary prerequisite federal offense motion order when say particularized mean alleged indictment it view indictment sufficient withstand motion dismiss allege chapter verse massachusetts law it misleading contention part since specify anything specify one section therefore less misled prepared defend aspect but move effect waived right jury return verdict you chose determination different matter in far double jeopardy clause protection though one right go jury empaneled determination come first jury think make motion like waive right favor preferred method determination but willing let arrive you wanted shortcircuited but made motion i take argument agree dbls recognized judge dismiss dbl he excluded evidence respect charge because excluded evidence evidence charge dismissed acquitted what position if brother white says going recognize dbls submission course certainly dismiss dbl one based upon numbers correct what happens stage trial supposing dbl element simply indictment bank robbery beginning government’s case trial judge says “i going exclude evidence bank robbery” what next step either parties take let us face we got whole bunch judges around country hypothetical may think something wrong indictment perhaps something wrong indictment and says “i going exclude evidence crime charged indictment” maybe poor ruling part judge defense counsel stage the government simply sitting move make what happens on motion defendant then fong foo case with brother rehnquist’s example let us say wholly irrationally and clearly conspicuously erroneous he excludes evidence result acquittal then fong foo case there acquittal government cannot appeal what happens case two counts indictment government offers evidence defendant says “well second count indictment really defective it effectively charge crime” the court says “i think right i going dismiss count course i exclude evidence government offered support crime charged it like chicken egg here court think indictment charge numbers crime is true case what do first exclude evidence dismiss indictment what he think indictment charged numbers crime is odd say judge entered acquittal crime thought indictment charge you making contention did judge think numbers crime adequately charged indictment how could judge enter acquit person enter judgment acquittal crime thought indictment even charge no one doubt crime charged i recall earlier statement you conceded left doubt it question waiving right double jeopardy it question consciously deciding go particular jury verdict but make choice but account counter practice would subjected client risk as say jury might come back verdict guilty you say six months experience mr easterbrook you least something us two three minutes,1455.0,2140,0,mr chief justice may please court the facts case distinctive simple since mr dimento’s argument concentrated fact i think i likewise least minutes lunch the indictment filed 1972 charged petitioner 16 others operating illegal gambling enterprise violation state law the indictment face stated language appears page 16a appendix petition defendants accepted “bets wagers paramutual numbers pool” it also charged gambling enterprise accepted bets horse races in words charged one crime committed two means after three years pretrial proceedings sixth day trial close government’s case defendants moved judgment acquittal grounds insufficiency evidence the judge rejected motion hand frivolous mr chief justice may please court just lunch i read part charging portion indictment said defendants part operation gambling enterprise accepted bets wagers paramutual number pool after district court denied motion judgment acquittal grounds insufficiency evidence defendants argued indictment failed state offense involving numbers betting although clearly face referred section 17 particular massachusetts statute this section argued referred mainly horse betting section 7 referred numbers betting after district court initially denied motion agreed concluded indictment adequately charge offense involving taking numbers bets having effectively struck charge face indictment charging numbers bets district court excluded numbers evidence irrelevant remained the trial recessed overnight prosecutor asked district court reconsider decision the district court asked counsel petitioner whether prejudiced counsel said open court indeed prejudice read indictment seen charge accepting numbers bets he asserted however need show prejudice technical matter i think i think court appeals right concluding show prejudice but minimum conceded would make difference burden show prejudice no i believe formal waiver sort we relied waiver honor it simply statement fact prejudice i would take concession mr dimento said open court today making specious motion nevertheless district court adhered ruling concluded indictment would read stating offense involving numbers with numbers theory removed district court turned evidence respect horse betting it found evidence insufficient show mr sanabria involved gambling enterprise acquitted remained the court appeals held equivalent dismissing indictment far charged engagement accepting numbers bets it held district court’s disposition numbers betting portion indictment acquittal nothing relating evidence elements offense defining elements offense simply conclusion indictment insufficient face the court remanded second trial respect gambling offense extent gambling offense involving numbers to extent involving horse betting indeed acquittal the court appeals held agree could retry petitioner charge petitioners argued criminal appeals act authorize appeal united states took this court held however criminal appeals act authorizes appeal final judgment unless double jeopardy clause bars way we believe therefore question court need confront constitutional one i turn directly we believe second trial horse betting theory permissible two reasons on on numbers theory i sorry first defendant opportunity trial seek resolution defects apparent face indictment must why defect face indictment the indictment perfectly valid facially they charged violation federal statute state criminal law mentioned one covering horserace betting that defective indictment sense word i think two answers there might might sufficient evidence convict court held insufficient relevant evidence convict you make motion trial basis no honor i meant contention another way the indictment face charged taking numbers bets referred state statute petitioner argued indictment would adequate charge taking numbers bets either recited section 7 massachusetts statute mentioned massachusetts statute just said violation state law yes but elements offense statement violated state law in order sufficient charge numbers bets involved to extent numbers bets adequately charged claim something went wrong face indictment although language indictment said numbers bets taken gambling offense statement section 17 massachusetts statute involved enough affect validity charge apparent face indictment it would open petitioner move trial strike language incorrect inconsistent way inadequate our argument since opened possibility second trial would otherwise needed held i get moment the second argument alternative argument district court’s decision removed numbers charged case petitioner’s request when district judge granted judgment acquittal left horse betting the case therefore significantly different last term’s decision lee held defendant could retried indictment dismissed midtrial defendants’ request the first argument timing petitioner’s motion rule 12b3 federal rules criminal procedure requires objections defects face indictment raised trial the argument indictment concededly recited petitioner engaged betting offense involving numbers actually charge offense it attack insufficiency indictment therefore required raised trial we collected note 23 brief authorities support proposition petitioner therefore entitled contention resolved trial not attacked indictment trial judge required treat charge sufficient the court consider in considering it erred petitioner’s favor timing motion petitioner’s choice judge reach it gave relief requested in erred second time court appeals held in words case result two errors district court made induced petitioner i think least three distinctions fong foo case one technical question whether indeed acquittal i get second part argument the important distinction case fong foo one pertinent argument i making in fong foo things led determination prosecution could raised trial the question whether prosecution’s witness lying whether evidence believable whether sufficient things underlay district court’s decision fong foo capable resolution trial general issue the third issue the third difference i sorry defendants fong foo ask district court they words request termination trial jury chance rule sufficiency evidence that one reason fong foo quite different cases like lee indeed cases like dinitz defendant motion took case away jury asked preverdict termination in dinitz defendant asked mistrial yes honor and quite different asking getting judgment acquittal i agree in lee defendant moved order dismissing indictment court held that equivalent mistrial i think also case defendant asks gets really dismissal indictment analysis applies regardless district court calls i mr easterbrook last point supposing suggest suggested morning defendant moved judgment acquittal asked instructions would really fairness mandate acquittal jury jury nevertheless found guilty then i suppose theory case trial judge actually adapted trial judge would obligated grant motion judgment notwithstanding acquittal notwithstanding verdict had scenario taken place would contend order trial judge would also dismissal let answer two ways first hypothetical case case court already decided it case foreman united states in 361 us court held second trial permissible case jury return verdict guilty teeth evidence judge defined judge wrongly removed jury’s consideration correct theory could convicted the second answer kind thing happened case jury fact acquitted instead convicting would acquittal charge extent involved numbers evidence our view numbers charge removed case well judge granted acquittal when judge effectively said numbers charge indictment inadequately stated took case what left horse betting charge whether district judge acquitted acquitted sent jury jury returned verdict acquittal view matter detail you would say even jury verdict acquittal erroneous exclusion evidence treated though indictment dismissed dbl yes honor i see we would dispute i think whether would characterize erroneous exclusion evidence it clear evidence taken case also i think clear involved before evidence went ruling indictment insufficient state part offense it page 16a petitioner certiorari suppose case identical facts lee defendant charged taking wallet blind operator candy stand post office the judge concluded hearing evidence indictment insufficient state offense charge defendant intended permanently deprive mr bilsky property said judge formally excluded evidence in view would make difference judge said concluded indictment insufficient face charge offense it simply matter detail the defendants’ interests fixed reason judge terminated case means that i think rationale underlying distinction dismissals indictment mistrials one hand true acquittals it reason case terminated form judge used make termination come the reason case terminated respect numbers offense simply defendant succeeded persuading court indictment bad face the purpose double jeopardy clause avoid multiple trials request prosecution it guards repeated prosecutions brought embarrass defendant subject anxiety increase chance conviction innocent man but premise rule possible guilt reliably determined single trial when guilt determined single trial holding two trials pointless offense defendants’ rights but premise rule hold true court allowed second trials order produce single fair trial for example second trial tainted conviction reversed there another trial mistrial granted manifest necessity even absence manifest necessity defendant requested there another trial lee indictment dismissed defendants’ request defect face in words first trial flawed second trial may held when defendant moves abort case verdict second trial may held even first one flawed in cases cannot said prosecutor deprived defendant valued right obtain verdict jury first trial no honor taking position lee bench trial if actually gone jury jury returned verdict acquittal view could review that would end things one difficulties reviewing judgments acquittal judgments acquittal could based upon reasons the judge may make erroneous instruction jury might acquit reasons nothing erroneous instruction not even necessarily irrationality simply disbelief proof might rational irrational particular case yes honor i think extent could reduced simply claim jury irrationality defendant entitled jury irrationality the reason i said view jury would acquitted offense extent involved numbers perhaps i entirely understanding hypothetical mr justice stevens in hypothetical would judge submit entire indictment together charge numbers horse betting in view numbers issue would still lie numbers issue never went jury it confusing case if submits theories jury i think jury’s acquittal final but takes case goes jury discrete basis imposition liability here numbers offense well ruled expressly indictment reach numbers charge yes it simply jury charge issue it case discrete sequence events that right as i understand hypothetical numbers charge would never go jury without evidence the jury would told indictment never charged numbers offense disregard language i think i still give answer since numbers charge gone case perhaps come depends part go in view gone excluded evidence he excluded evidence gone the evidence quite irrelevant case held valid numbers charge face indictment the evidence excluded gone legal theory much sufficiency evidence indeed relevance evidence adequacy indictment i think key case yes honor we agree fact put jeopardy the jeopardy terminated requested effective dismissal indictment lee in lee although information defective jeopardy attached beginning trial that would always double jeopardy bar second trial charge submitted jury there exceptions view i sorry honor i follow hypothetical i think conviction circumstances would teeth evidence would reversed court appeals or set aside trial court it happened the foreman case one examples yes honor i believe mr justice marshall i think answer answer i given justice stevens time got numbers offense taken case entirely would remain go jury indeed remained district judge entered judgment acquittal nothing numbers he would instruct jury way convict man charge remains your honor motion view material one motion judgment acquittal it motion take numbers theory case once done acquittal followed quite naturally but dispositive point view time numbers theory came let suggest analogy use brief suppose indictment two counts understand petitioner contest could one count charging conducting gambling enterprise taking horse bets the count charging conduct gambling enterprise taking numbers bets the district judge would done two discrete things he would charged first count indictment charging taking numbers bets insufficient face dismissed then would submitted second count jury second count dealing taking numbers bets the jury would acquitted in view case hypothetical it makes difference defendants far double jeopardy interests concerned whether one count two although view horse betting count went jury final unreviewable disposition numbers argument anything the prosecutor substantial discretion drafting indictment certainly honor i think agreed least parties twocount indictment case would proper i think far double jeopardy clause concerned make difference whether one count two in greene united states 555 us page 190 note 10 court took exactly kind question the question greene whether made difference part first second degree murder expressed one count rather two the court said situation though greene charged different offenses separate alternative counts indictment the constitutional issues stake turn fact offenses charged jury one count the true case the constitutional issue turn fact theories liability charged one count the interests defendant either way the issue district judge eventually entered judgment acquittal numbers betting theory liability excuse horse betting numbers betting if i make mistake going exceedingly embarrassing i repeat problems largely petitioner’s making there fatal flaw indictment the first trial infected error the petitioner took perfectly adequate trial brought halt persuaded judge adequately charged aborted trial without obtaining verdict jury all unnecessary the timing petitioner’s choice the error introduced petitioner’s urging we therefore believe urged district court twice timing taking numbers offense case entitled absolute immunity prosecution we therefore believe court appeals correctly held double jeopardy clause bar petitioner’s second trial correct i wrong i may much double jeopardy recently did martin linen case effect hold grant motion acquittal equivalent jury verdict acquittal yes honor we contest holding although i argued martin linen case side but gist argument two things happened one respect horse betting theory liability ended true judgment acquittal although entered judge it treated jury cannot retry mr sanabria horse betting it difficult conceive acquittal part count but i know whole case involves for reason i think could acquittal count one twocount indictment charge broken two counts could it depends characterizing district judge way court appeals characterized but think reading correct characterization fair rest argument downhill i i think alternative ground decision must seen holding,403.0,527,17,i think pick 100 mr easterbrook mr easterbrook may resume wait it one thing say show prejudice it another say prejudiced do suggest that form waiver it form formal form kind waiver and said violation state law because component federal offense the fong foo case result egregious errors trial court made ending judgment acquittal held regardless extremely serious almost irrational errors acquittal could appeal government double jeopardy clause and third you said three the third difference you going get martin linen i suppose mr easterbrook proceed talking indictment one alleged i find indictment appendix anywhere else thank mr easterbrook let sure i position lee case you taking position case gone jury lee acquitted judge’s view striking evidence forth acquittal could appealed though dismissal i thought said matter detail that right it bench trial had jury trial gone jury but notbecause supposing reason acquittal erroneous theory indictment erroneous instruction jury effect excluded case evidence relating horse betting numbers whichever one what difference under instruction could convict instruction faithfully applied could convict they might done irrational reason give defendant benefit irrationality no hypothesis proof permissible theory could go jury it nothing disbelieve but still say acquittal would dismissal but i thought told earlier case gone jury jury acquitted that matter detail could another trial how know submitted maybe believe somebody example gave earlier he would entrusted jury evidence relating horse betting whichever one stricken considered but evidence still find guilty horse betting theory find guilty find evidence horse betting i stricken evidence horse betting then say evidence acquit no say submits issues jury i sorry i getting example clear yes how take case excluding evidence that then said evidence i going enter judgment acquittal but jury precisely thing say dismissal i understand correctly the jury free i suppose include defendants guilty thought guilty numbers charge what special charge jury they acquitted single count indictment but gone excluded evidence he tell jury anything indictment he excluded evidence may i ask one question i stop i apologize taking much time would agree numbers charge apparently would regarded first circuit sufficient indictment numbers charge well horse betting charge defendant actually put jeopardy numbers charge assuming two separate theories liability first witness began testify maybe jury sworn mr easterbrook theory would ever case double jeopardy case count indictment submitted jury judge respect jury returns verdict guilty do agree judge ruled evidence way sun jury could legally convict once judge ruled evidence excluded evidence way sun jury could legally convict petitioner it could legally done court but almost impossible judge probably instructed jury yes i weak we practicing six months but point judge took evidence case judge without obliged instruct jury practically acquit if done jeopardy would judge instruct jury way convict man then difference the difference technically defense counsel asked would done without motion do want say prosecutor throw indictment wants is discretion draft illegal unfair indictment that depends reading indictment way suggested mr easterbrook one question appealability at outset mentioned view criminal appeals act an appeal lies wherever the second trial would barred double jeopardy clause stated court effect held are referring i characterize dicta wilson case thank gentlemen the case

presented involve whether procedures followed adequate assure reliability either guilt determination penalty determination despite evidence verdict mr spaziano may may guilty first degree murder this jury given options guilt deliberations the one option jury sentencing verdict choose exercise overriden judge judge privy guilt deliberations jury the death sentence case thus results my point simply judge part guilt deliberations thats correct well dual constraints power jurys decisionmaking there constraints guilt phase jurys ability evaluate defendants culpability reasonable manner the question whether guilt phase jury must given two options must jury jurys verdict life second phase least accorded finality i believe new trial appropriate beck the imposition life sentence i believe would least far relief go the question whether new trial required settled beck logic beck would indicate new trial required harm beck harm distorted fact finding time defendants life stake thats correct no but first issue beck issue it involves application courts decision beck v alabama the court held beck death sentence simply may imposed consistent constitution imposed verdict quilt capital offense jury options acquittal the court reasoned situation puts pressure jury threatens efficacy reasonable doubt standard guilt determination much capital case risk cant tolerated risk unwarranted conviction great therefore beck alabama legislature passed statute preventing jury considering lesser offenses procedure held unconstitutional similarly keeble court faced prosecution indian jurisdiction lower court lesser offenses indian court determined nevertheless error so unavailability i know the final result it remanded i know it may i know court since held decide question jurisdiction keeble well never got point request statute limitations run the way could instructions statute limitations yes no i dont believe would situation would result beck well jury would precisely jury supposed excuse see position premised fact jury fact finder returns verdict tells us essentially offense occurred and statute limitations especially florida separate legal decision judge make it made time judge jury my answer i believe would mislead jury instruct lesser offenses jury instructed offense lesser offenses determined juries offense committed lesser offense would precisely jury the judge would determine statute limitations but options if believed that would mislead jury much state options one change statute limitations incidentally florida since done there number options get around harm identified beck simply unavailability jury lesser offense indict sooner the state yes that absolutely clear florida law yes yes and want waive statute limitations yes juries make decisions speak statute limitations cases its jurisdictional if example statute limitations offense alleged occurred period end statute period ended statute would submitted jury would period fell within statute charge offense it would submitted jury way much statute limitations something jury the court could determine separately yes the jury told time court determine the cases cited state brief fact courts determine factual questions regarding statute limitations not record but maybe record maybe something dont know well told certain things none matter record i dont want suggest court i saying number determinations could made werent no if statute limitations problem jury sentence less capital yes judge sentences i think clearly lack third option enhanced risk unwarranted conviction case the record quite easily viewed demonstrating precisely court predicted beck actually come true the jury great deal time wrestling twooption dilemma it deliberated number hours judicial interruption asking jury could reach verdict there finally reported deadlock allen charge shortly thereafter verdict only dynamited verdict and contrast got penalty trial jury rendered quick verdict life imprisonment those i think indicate i cannot tell vote its matter record i know it thats correct in case however judge going poll jury decided i guess embarrass jury so might known changed minds the jury instructed majority currently 66 current practice florida life it would take 7 death 6 life current practice right so position simply evil unreliability predicted beck case true the jury deprived opportunity fully evaluating weight evidence reasonable manner precisely reasons court said beck pressures court identified beck we making claim intent much possibility intent i i dont know if state intentionally waited statute limitations i think argument would stronger nevertheless i think facts case could thats penalty thats harsh penalty i think i understand in case i think important know however threeweek delay state florida according records record known year dilisios allegations complaining witness known year left i guess unresolved record one certainly could interpreted indicating intent the second issue presented second issue second prong constraints jurys decisionmaking ability the second issue narrow issue issue concerns narrow aspect florida statute florida capital sentencing statute and simply whether trial judge may disregard jury sentencing verdict sentencing trial verdict favor defendant well answer two ways first florida didnt make decision floridas decision it may effect essential question presenting whether thats appropriate court constitutional legislature that question presenting under arguments presenting yes i would problem statute our position eighth amendment standards well standards guided sixth amendment require jurys input the unique nature capital our position probably boil question court whether jury may judge overrule well yes under eighth amendment contention under fifth amendment bullington would contention but involves different considerations yes i think need examine little the vast majority states require jury sentencing capital cases there 38 states currently capital punishment 31 states in crimes i dont believe our focus unique nature capital sentencing decision capital sentencing brings considerations controlling noncapital cases noncapital cases concerned rehabilitation various aspects capital sentencing decision yes it simply judge may impose death sentence jury ruled favor defendant sentence jury imposes life that jury involved the sentencing decision eighth amendment analysis sixth amendment analysis would jury were arguing alternative course bullington least says judge could overrule jury jury involved no under double jeopardy principles base bullington thats bullington decision whether jurys verdict life sentence must final thats court held thats urging thats correct yes there there four states currently and position would think would counsel yes jury necessary capital sentencing decision least eighth amendment that question course presented we briefed way i think thats logical conclusion yes not oh im sorry with judge sentencing jury involved three no there 38 total 31 require jurys consent death i appendix the number its 27 i think at bottom uniqueness death sentencing decision i enthusiastic argument our argument simply follows methodology court eighth amendment testing contemporary values and see since mid19th century constant move towards jury sentencing and looking whats going still jury sentencing states move away jury sentencing including florida jury sentencing 100 years courts decision furman suggesting suggested woodson v north carolina states reacting judgment whether judge jury better sentencer simply trying retain constitutionality statute furman so decision argument first eighth amendment tested evolving standards requires courts independent assessment also counsel way death decision different it requires conscience community the court repeatedly emphasized death penalty expression moral outrage retribution issue set jury deterrence relevant legislature deciding whether pass statute its i dont believe relevant sentencing phase selecting going die type issue directed towards people towards uniqueness particular individual no i dont think thats result would result acquittal well analogy trial guilt a judge cannot overrule jurys verdict defendant i dont think i could argue i dont think either constitutionally required judge overrule death constitutionally prohibited i mean would number states would unconstitutional either way i think florida make choice and i could id like reserve remainder time very briefly clear facts justice stevenss question regarding overruling death verdict judges overruling death verdict statistics kept indications certiorari petition petition attached appendix set statistics data done collected linda foley professor foley done study that data reports set certiorari petition appendix death involved either jury judge thinking death decided death disagreement 6 percent judge would impose life jury would impose death 28 percent jury would impose judge imposes death so disagreement quite vast about avoiding detection course true the thats required florida state file arrest warrant tolls statute limitations absolutely indication record joe spaziano avoiding detection we would ask court require new trial beck v alabama require imposition life sentence consistent jury said thank you,678.0,809,49,mr barnard i think may proceed youre ready well say judge privy judge penalty jury took place well course judge never is and jury i see point if prevail case counsel whats consequence prevailing a new trial on imposition life sentence would mr barnard youre arguing two quite separate points though arent that wouldnt true points would you lesser included offense argument i understand also argue jury overridden penalty phase as latter wouldnt want get new trial would and result keeble know i suppose inference federal court despite lack jurisdiction could find guilty try find guilty lesser included facts he didnt go free at least nothing i take request lesser included offense instructions case but youre saying instruction i take and would judge charge jury elements offense also tell jury statute limitations run judgment could entered verdict returned verdict kind then youd judge charge jury give jury impression defendant could sentenced returned verdict lesser included offense even though fact defendant couldnt sentenced well theory lesser included offense charge jury may willing doubtful case may willing find someone guilty lesser included offense rather greater offense think option rather option acquitting finding guilty greater offense isnt little inconsistent give jury impression return verdict guilty lesser offense punishment fact cant and another indict sooner certainly statute werent present client would entitled i take lesser included offense instructions was asked waive statute limitations is role florida jury make determinations connection statute limitations defense point is theres factual dispute connection how would jury involved determining statute limitations issue but court would determine matter law whether statute run is correct are suggesting possibility instruction given verdicts returned lesser included offense offenses could sentenced no course well statute limitations either run hadnt difficult determine aid calendar in florida suppose instruction given jury found guilt lesser included offense would jury florida jury sentencing who the judge does record tell us vote jury life sentence well florida law would lawful would possible know unless jury foreman reported affirmatively judge ordinarily judge instructs jury foreman disclose exact vote let ask one question i dont remember under florida law recommend life vote required does majority vote favor life at time took 7 life least mr barnard making claim state purposefully delayed case statute limitations run lesser offenses would case different could prove or state right why would stronger all waive statute i mean could protect it cancels delay i dont see harsh penalty if theyre deliberately delaying youll defense wouldnt otherwise waive defense seems youre back started when state legislature apparently florida state legislature done gives judge power saying many words jury permitted make recommendation judge whatever use judge wants make recommendation isnt amounts isnt effect well legislature many words expressly said jury option may recommend judge sentence given judge shall sole final power would problem kind statute i take position judge never entitled sentence anybody death jury death case always jury given sentencing authority isnt position i know thats question submission really judge able sentence person death of course know jury sentencing uniform rule nation there lot states juries dont sentence your theory would outlaw judge sentencing crimes wouldnt is argument mr barnard special theory capital cases jury reliable sentencer perhaps judge jury agree i sure do understand question what florida set system said jury shall find question guilt innocence another trial judge whether death penalty imposed that would offend theory well jury found person guilty first degree murder capital homicide whatever state called but sentencing trial conducted judge without jury so jury factor kind two bites apple factor youre arguing youre arguing judge jury must concur well i thought bullington describing missouri procedure i didnt think said matter constitutional procedure judge permitted overrule jury yes jury didnt return anything except verdict whether person guilty offense sentencing turned judge you still say could done you aware number states precise thing judge determine sentence capital case separate hearing jury determination and position states operating unconstitutional procedures you said four states jury override provision there four states how many override provision florida so total seven states jury actually make decision doublecounting and 31 many must jury unanimous well never mind ill find papers whats basic theory i kind know want win i dont really understand theory why jury make determination view does anything different theories punishment stake death case opposed cases you dont sees awfully enthusiastic position candid i dont really understand argument said orally well isnt retribution its also deterrence respect rest community well i suppose irony position really mean judge would never role whether impose death penalty jury imposed death penalty could override decision well say jury sole sentencer eighth amendment what business judge got overruling well arguing judge power overrule jury one way that jury makes wrong decision very well mr menser thank gentlemen the case submitted well hear arguments next arcc state tax commissioner virginia west virginia,586.0,903,3,mr chief justice may please court mr spaziano presented three claims today the first course claim hes entitled relief tactical decision trial send case jury allornothing basis i think addressing issue start right discovering and fact mr spaziano went court said judge i thing i ought killed whose attorney went jury closing argument said look folks heres man accused first degree murder heres man whos accusing and said classic golden rule argument said would want life hands mr dilisio drug user reprobate knows else it strong argument it led jury great length time returning guilty verdict fact mr spazianos strategic choice hit jury right eyes argument and gambled lost wants another roll dice and dont think fair state florida constant retrials defendants tests alternate defense theories and thats basically theyre asking the statute limitations defense constitutional defense it statutory defense it set state florida placed hands defendants criminal cases use see fit thats whole thing mr spaziano chose use somebody else might choose use the fact use bargaining chip render constitutionally suspect proceeding waiver speedy trial would guilty plea would would waive right jury trial there simply constitutional problem mr spaziano fact thought little argument didnt even appeal florida supreme court what filed brief beck decision cane sent supplemental authority so didnt even dawn rights horrendously violated someone told on jury override question would submit right bat jury override case there gardner remand the first time case cane cert court florida supreme court decided remand case resentencing pursuant gardner happened original trial jury told mr spaziano committed three murders four bombings raped girl orlando cut eyes couldnt testify and cases fellow members outlaws motorcycle gang scared witnesses yes the trial judge mistaken impression could tell no no particular case trial judge ruled least correct that issues could presented jury felt since one rape conviction appeal so wrong when i presented argument context gardner remand necessarily fair what case situation jury rendered far state concerned worst possible decision okay advisory sentence they recommended life thats bottom line thats could what concerned fact that proceeding led mr spaziano sentenced but set aside remanded pursuant gardner when actually sentenced jury it straight proceeding judge we dont know jury jury would done second sentencing no i give judge one i wont hang two i think overrode jury one time well dont quite frankly jury doesnt sentence man anyway the question asked counsel arguing whether florida statute jury sentencing mere advisory sentence counsel indicated thought sentence but statute clear section florida statute 921 141b im sorry 2 titled advisory sentence jury and proffitt barclay make abundantly clear jury doesnt sentence anybody this straight sentencing judge its compliance constitution really problem well mr justice white 200 men death row we 80 cases judge erred overriding jury verdict 120 cases judge blindly followed jury refused exercise discretion superior abilities okay the argument doesnt merit the fact florida unique state mr spaziano may happy going jury decision orlando seminole county rather urban i guarantee put ocoee apalachicola ku klux klan country somewhere hell thanking god every day judge override jury so specious argument that i dont know im sorry when judge enters life sentence automatic review supreme court florida when life sentence would go district court appeal would make final determination no in fact court observed proffitt barclay florida supreme court rejected almost 80 percent jury overrides death imposed and cases jury recommended death dont know many times judge given life but assume happens correct thats long short unless court particular question well know one whos received ever broken law but fact facetious fact three prongs okay there fact society protected in mr spazianos case perhaps 12 murders 4 bombings knows many rapes okay no murders go prison real present danger prison guards inmates the second one deterrence factor we know well well never know many people dont commit murder might get chair we know recidivism rate executed prisoners zero and one life saved way thats fine us its worth and third factor course miniscule nonexistent counsel refers retribution factor discussed i personally dont accept basically protection society prevention future murders i dont i dont really see i mean maybe i jury got worked guy maybe i would want get even but i cant make decision someone else its im sure i dont know important if i might digress article recently column jim kilpatrick regarding fact federal system death penalty two prisoners washington dc trying get aryan brotherhood get kill somebody and could happen killed two prison guards space hour federal government could return cell already life sentence this i mean i say look terms protecting society including society within prison walls that could if someone managed get life sentence kept going yes your honor bodies discovered strangers 1975 there actually two bodies discovered one could piece together mr spazianos modus operandi dismember victims still alive scatter parts they could find evidence directly linking mr spaziano crime the prosecution commence record enough information get indictment information time finally they mr dilisios ramblings jail i would agree defense reliable individual world i wouldnt go put someone jail first degree murder charge based something said without getting corroboration it fault mr spaziano avoided arrest two years shouldnt benefit now old case came floridas old limitations statute under new statute limitations problem would exist defendant avoids arrest statute limitations told but unfortunately old statute hid two years could get away murder thats i have,181.0,276,12,but general menser isnt true things could presented jury first hearing but prosecutor try submit jury so i mean isnt sort side coin first point they fair opportunity present jury elected but ruled erroneously matter florida law but wrong so seems kind want ways you cant say jury didnt fair know considered everything state submitted and state didnt submit evidence i dont know say jury didnt fair opportunity judge question life death well sentenced death proceeding also the net result trial judge overruled jury twice the jury recommended life opportunity pass question and judge overruled well cant blame defendant all right but still thats issue case whether thats constitutionally permissible and i understand course think well opposition says jury sentencing case florida purports put decision hands judge wrong complying constitution what got say may i inquire you say 120 cases judge followed jurys recommendation advisory verdict death 80 overrode how many judge jury recommended death judge overruled gave life so effect way seems work jury recommends death going death and jury recommends life may second opportunity state impose death sentence those statistics citing people death row i suppose definition end death sentence well let ask question i somewhat interested question whether appropriate impose death sentence jury apparently unanimously recommended life fair infer i think promptness acted what rationale death penalty floridas death penalty is rehabilitation but would protected incarceration life without possibility parole example you dont think retribution significant factor floridas scheme this penologists said death sentence imposed prisoners life prisoners commit murder within prison process escape limiting death sentence narrow category deterrence do comment indictment delayed very well do anything counsel you

good faith efforts someone bucks position example would relevant determination whether violation willful and fact reflects happened case jury found violation  found  motivations involved included

changed one written explanation never obeyed rule 3 months effect the explanation given buck told wasnt  couldnt found 19th the story given staub time korenchuk couldnt find 20th responding responding wrong question but arent versions written record time the written record time says fired breaking rule ever since january nobody claims thats true if i   number questions i think particularly justice alito asked whether congress would intended result case we dont think harsh think intent particularly clear section 43011 says purpose codified purpose purpose statute minimize disadvantages civilian careers result service military and seems to read  read rest statute secondly userra unique among employment statutes close employer economic incentive break law its expensive keep reservists books and mulally korenchuk objected staub working precisely cost money went drill cost money called operation iraqi freedom i think particularly compelling textual reasons position urging statutes different language you might decide case well think would wrong reasons set brief could write opinion addressed userra left questions open of language title vii similar 4311c1 language i read purpose isnt title vii so could decide case somewhat narrower grounds reach every situation the  interpretation userra adopted seventh circuit creates serious loophole statute as number amici pointed amici side employers typically make disciplinary decision result bunch different decisions the seventh circuit holds long employer divides responsibilities userra apply many decisions on view userra applies last decisionmaker and narrower role narrower protections statute this statute read way not language i recounted userra reemployment rights antidiscrimination rights play essential role national defense they safeguard livelihood men women safeguard nation and congress wouldnt wanted statute read wrong,455.0,539,26,we hear argument afternoon case 09400 staub v proctor hospital mr schnapper well jump agency law shouldnt take look language statute and statute says prima facie case made shown military service antimilitary animus motivating factor employers action the employers action discharge right and word motivate means provide someone motive something right and person something person discharged discharged mr staub right so doesnt follow motivation relevant statute motivation person  performs action challenged no   made illegal certain employer actions right not everything thats done  writing bad report biased reason actionable statute isnt correct but say decisions contribute decisions supervisory personnel if theory correct i dont know i dont know coemployee hostile motivation makes report supervisor ultimately dismisses individual  wouldnt qualify well the employer would liable lower supervisory employees did authority discharge why stand different shoes coemployee also contributes ultimate decision fire could i ask  could i ask argument leads lets say employer calls employee says now decide lay looked record last 10 years evaluations youve gotten past 10 years based  weve decide going person laid now turns one evaluations rendered someone antimilitary bias would make employee  would prima facie case employer even  even employer time every  made every reasonable effort investigate validity prior evaluations still employer would hook well thats sweeping rule i going ask related hypothetical suppose  officer charge charged decision terminate terminate says im going hearing you counsel and  suppose buck  suppose two employees allegedly antimilitary testified said antimilitary bias person terminated later employee evidence two lying could bring action thats sweeping thats almost insurers liability insofar director employment concerned he insure he  done everything hearing almost absolute liability but there defense employer matter ill enough else warrant termination employee and that isnt statute says you jump language statute it motivating factor decision discharge and speaks  looks natural  natural reading looks motivation person actually makes decision discharge now im suggesting thats right rule thats unattractive rule but rule suggested also unattractive rule one i doubt congress intended adopt is reasonable middle position its nothing isnt  governments formulation discrimination play substantial role termination limiting principle i mean answered appeared answering justice alito 10year history one report discrimination existed that would shift burden employer is accurate statement law that one report play role mere existence doesnt than sg but materiality decision i mean  play role it play material role decision or  use substantial it could material mr schnapper i guess goes back justice alitos question i find difficult grasp distinction draw seems could possibly exist willful motivating factor nonwillful motivating factor i mean say motivating  say willful seems but want us draw distinction willful motivating factor nonwillful motivating factor you want hold employer liable actions officials one firing and liable  hold employer liable contribution firing seems to hold liable willfulness well thank mr schnapper mr miller well i dont think anybody thought buck would fired one absence that trigger but trigger followed long series prior absences disciplined i dont see inconsistency two versions well think standard employer liability different statute federal antidiscrimination statutes is suggesting so hold vii adea ada why would title vii different thank counsel the case submitted,650.0,939,8,mr chief justice may please court the parties case total agreement respect two points the first point linda buck made decision fire vincent staub and second point evidence whatsoever linda buck possessed animus towards mr staub account service reserve applying ordinary tortrelated vicarious liability rules staubs case proctor hospital would end right but seventh circuit applying calls cats paw doctrine gives staub plaintiffs like second bite apple right i think situation consistent cats paw analysis facts set two supervisors dominated decision would likely finding case goes jury but input whatsoever beyond still domination issue if i change hypothetical little bit say said true addition fellow got fired 10year history late looked history i think shes made independent decision happened case therefore seventh circuits rule liability attaches thats right result i think jury decide im sure case latter extended hypothetical gets far i disagree little bit i dont think engaged investigation absolves liability i think engages good faith investigation absolves liability right i answer before i get i disagree point wasnt given opportunity explain i think record clear given opportunity explain at  two times at time discharged day korenchuk brings korenchuk says i looking couldnt find  and record fact staub gave explanation whereabouts buck she heard the second time approximately 5 days later files fivepage long grievance stating i think record shows give explanation whereabouts the record also shows filed fivepage grievance contesting action after fired and buck carefully investigated 5 days filed gave letter saying i looked i considered arguments including argument discharged account military service i dont credit and therefore im sustaining discharge and absolutely  mr staub knew that works 1998 invoked procedure discharged first time similar reasons conditionally reinstated employment proctor hospital i agree the mr staub others like second bite apple but demonstrate person possessed animus exercised much control decisionmaker that person became true decisionmaker and simply doesnt work case number reasons the answer statute sets forth five factors four five factors says one four five employment actions motivating factor arriving decision okay its 4311a and says from third line  well im sorry i cant tell line it says five actions prohibited denial initial employment reemployment retention employment promotion benefit employment and says employer cannot take action one actions basis four factors membership application membership performance service  service obligation uniformed services so something connect one factors one five actions and thats literal meaning statute and i think seventh circuits view absolutely consistent correct that subordinates motivation imputed actually decisionmaker ultimately employer well i think context case your honor definition employer includes proctor hospital might call ultimate employer also includes person made adverse employment decision and case linda buck and statute creates personal liability ms buck anybody else makes decision based one factors contained statute i dont think way jury would allowed consider whether ms buck violation statute absolute dearth evidence factors motivated decision made i agree it extent makes good faith investigation background facts and case acting awful lot information they pick okay that would lead neverending chain looking backwards time course perhaps long employment history scour record determine one single two single actions may somehow come forward caused termination im sure i thoroughly understand hypothetical true decisionmaker comes forward says i didnt know i didnt rely upon i dont think animus imputed decisionmaker i dont think right correct no consideration proximate cause either because motivate  motivated one factors element proximate causation i think i think that seventh circuits way saying proximate cause i think could say and i agree get back notion case ms buck made decision she made im sorry only one respect he received technical good respect narrative portion evaluation says i want stay department paid work wandering around  i dont think know answer it yes and b employer could liable in b person made decision employer motivated one factors statute person couldnt liable if person cant liable employer person vicariously liable i dont think oh i disagree a corporation act agents i listened hypothetical long enough i lost track made decision fire thank as i understand second person hypothetical motivation whatsoever statute cause discharge therefore employer wouldnt liable decision normally would give weight governments position i think governments position consistent precise language statute there charge filed secretary labor secretary labor would investigate the secretary labor option bring action secretary choose but coterminously individual service person bring independent cause action thats happened case in case secretary labor involvement i think problem situation is one actors decision made mulally thats respect evidence animus adduced didnt commit action would actionable userra there  way issuing constructive advice record january 27 violated statute even motivated animus sure the instruction may somewhat protective problem prior issuing instruction district court analysis whatsoever determine instruction warranted first place simply point seventh circuit before allow fall lap jury try explain jury opposed supreme court means cats paw agency theory district court least make initial determination thats i believe thing  may section later your honor regs deals that certainly commentary goes i agree ms buck would said i let go veritable tsunami bad behaviors accused absolutely consistent i made decision is truthful statement it absolutely truthful statement reason actions i think ms bucks consideration discharge decision wasnt limited one source it clearly no one shaped directed scope determination even important gave mr staub opportunity tell side story and considering decided discharge warranted right again your honor i believe record says  i apologize i cant quote page  fact mr staub protested accused ie supposed wrong and stated version if questions your honor i would respectfully request decision seventh circuit affirmed thank you,1034.0,1261,31,lets look hypothetical take facts case there two supervisors antimilitary animus report gentleman late wasnt absolutely falsehood they go report miss buck miss buck investigation there witnesses there one else prove came late she takes supervisors word she looks report moments employee didnt show says hes lategoer i dont know anything antianimus i simply fired two supervisors trustworthy ive looked files theyve never lied anything pretty honest people what happens situation how she went looked witnesses didnt find she looked records she  happened people complained people dont particularly like well thats question you added important fact 10year history late but day wasnt late on day two supervisors made would fired absent report isnt jury decide well circuits cats paw theory others say engaged investigation theres liability what  because  name  korenchuk takes bucks office buck hands pink slip says youre fired jury could credited evidence he given opportunity explain situation what kind investigation what  looked personnel file what else investigation when this got pink slip what  point  korenchuk takes  takes staub bucks office according testimony jury could credit wasnt asked thing she said heres pink slip youre fired after fired did i understand say agree seventh circuits cats paw approach before  consistent statutory language requires discrimination simply motivating factor can  lets look statutory factors and reading page 3 blue brief well im sorry the statute says motivating  one four things membership application et cetera motivating factor action and i understood position supervisor dominant control cats paw well i guess im trouble following total dominationmotivating factor it seems like much stringent test seventh circuit adopted but assumes employment decision solely its based peccadilloes based information gathered but  shes acting vacuum shes acting information supplied people authorized supply employment context we talking past individual case i talking legal analysis she decisionmaker multiple actors behalf employer thats adversarys position  participating process and saying actors process delegated employment duties permit participate way motivates bias kind employer responsible ms bucks activities two supervisors discriminatory activities well situations employer comes says i fired x x y z reasons and dont mention one inconsequential immaterial reports would court rely its motivating factor why complicated im probably missing something but thing  doesnt help i dont think isnt complicated that burlington talking certain number employees could make employer responsible right so supervisory people well call now dont stop say statute statute says  bad motive motivating  motivating factor discriminatory  discriminatory motivating factor dismissal unless prove affirmative defense lose why something special one small group employees happens person said last words happens somebody told somebody said last words happens somebody told somebody somethingorother you looking one thing and could five zillion fact situations so something special why seventh circuit say guy said last words show quote singular influence why singular influence why statute says  led  said led discriminatory motive motivating factor period end matter no special cats paw rule special anything rule oh of course show proximate cause you show cause you always im saying special rule why special rule somebody second floor you wouldnt think so going persons second floor happen somebody told somebody rather somebody person told fine you perfectly entitled say but i dont see entitled say words seventh circuit used you show jury sufficient evidence support finding singular influence that doesnt sound like motivating cause that sounds like something really special ah okay so dont say seventh circuit thats way saying normal thing like cause accept please dont use words and might used  might used meaning something else send back certain applying test everything in words motivating factor all right that seems like good resolution case i dont know i think youve misread  i think youve misread cats paw principle court appeals i dont think determination proximate cause as i understand opinion say statute requires  let get right language  discriminatory prohibited discriminatory factor must motivating factor employers action and say means must motivated person took employers action its motivating factor employers action unless person took action behalf employer motive then court appeals makes exception however person appears taking action behalf employer really person took action totally control subordinate  person swallowed subordinates determination hold even though ultimate firing  person signed pink slip even though person didnt motive  fact decision effectively decision lower subordinate hold employer it nothing proximate cause it text motivating factor employers action motivating factor somewhere line employers action thats i read court appeals opinion but but ms buck never would made decision korenchuk hadnt come said heres staub hes goofing told tell going absent didnt korenchuk absent  motivating factor certainly happened mr staub didnt mr korenchuk marching staub bucks office would retained job wasnt last  recent performance rating good in case indication apart korenchuks coming buck would taken adverse action staub thats point it seems to establish  going secondguess jury determination i understood point theres difference motivating factor decision means person made decision behalf employer must motive hand factor relevant decision factor influenced decision thats quite different motivating factor decision you get us believe  im sure  motivating factor decision refers motive part person made decision thats essentially point isnt then cant agree question would you two people a b supervisors one case b fires employee army says ha ha thats im in second case fires employee thought employee one justice sotomayors hypotheticals anyone else fires perfectly good reason a lied and reason a lied wanted tell lie b would fire employee reason hes army those two situations second seems one 80  80 million situations factrelated could arise i dont know want special standard situation why ask overall question action action  bad motive motivating factor forget psychoanalysis a b good enough  vice versa that question because together dismissed employee one supplying false statement acting they agents thats i made burlington people i wanted get group they burlington status get issue and together fire individual in absence either one wouldnt fired i feel im going get nowhere pursuing hypothetical so i drop say answer wish understand well position  coincides seventh circuit opposition secretary labors commentary works the secretary labors commentary motivating factor korenchuk precipitates whole thing thats motivating factor do  i mean secretary labor administers statute do give weight governments official position motivating factor means how secretary labor administer statute what  responsibilities statute well isnt governed standard principles tort concurrent actors actor a negligent actor b contributed accident and look restatement torts whether wrongful actor made significant contribution thats  thats end but  talking test the test i gave quite different cats paw test and use test something along lines i formulated i dont know thats precisely restatement says general effect instruction given jury really overprotective client standard concurrent  concurrent causation analysis can i turn secretary labors regulations are talking anything following statement commentary accompanying final regs namely employee quote need show protected activities status sole cause employment action  the persons activities status need one factors truthful employer would list asked reasons decision  is  this one government refers that doesnt seem to damning case i think employer asked reasons decision would given ms bucks reasons could jury find testimony  time received pink slip  lets talk grievance time got grievance slip given opportunity explain charge warranted tried reach korenchuk phone tell going lunch unable he opportunity say ms buck thank mr davis mr schnapper 4 minutes remaining mr schnapper recollection record state version got pink slip,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,408.0,549,9,mr chief justice may please court an employer liable userra supervisor acting discriminatory motive uses delegated authority cause adverse employment action the court appeals held liability attach unless supervisor exerts singular influence decisionmaker but standard inconsistent statute two reasons first incompatible statutory definition employer includes ultimate decisionmaker person employer delegated performance significant employment responsibilities second contrary statutes causation standard requires military status motivating factor necessarily singularly important factor determinative factor adverse employment action now no there two separate components inquiry first  first motivating factor plaintiffs burden establish order make prima facie case section 4311c and affirmative defense employer show butfor factor sense know even person military action would taken thats  employer show absolved liability in view motivating factor language captures idea proximate cause something motivating factor one many factors view need trivial de minimus factor situation bias  action biased supervisor leads long improbable unforeseeable chain causation adverse employment action might butfor cause wouldnt proximate cause wouldnt motivating factor now case i think real world cases quite different here termination decision made buck basis january 27th warning given petitioner report petitioner complied warning and parts warning issued mulally report noncompliance came korenchuk parts jury could concluded the  discriminatorily motivated actions case evidence interpreted light favorable petitioner decision mulally write petitioner january 27th incident motivated hostility status army reserves decision korenchuk report violated terms january 27th warning also motivated hostility petitioners membership  army reserves and decisions substantial causal role  ultimate decision made employer terminate and people mulally korenchuk well may semantic disagreement we dont think substantial sense predominant it one  many factors long one thats motivating factor but needs substantial sense de minimus trivial something employer actually took account one reasons there would still liability liability situation quite common employer gives single official authority observe employees behavior make decision terminate if single official biased makes decision basis bias employer going liable even people hired official tried hard make sure wasnt biased and thats consistent it  motivating  statute says motivating factor employers action yes employer  employer corporation  look individuals look figuring whether motivating factor statute tells us in definition 4303 says employer includes everyone delegated performance employmentrelated responsibilities they they last person signs piece paper certainly part employers they  delegated supervisory responsibility  employer authority observe people supervision evaluate report performance authority initiate disciplinary proceedings and used authority discriminatory manner that conduct substantial causal factor  ultimate action discharge and given  statutory definition employer motivating factor causation standard thats enough statute  liability no even though say sense would butfor causation but  standard proximate causation  initial discriminatory discipline warning would motivating substantial factor ultimate decision fire he fired intervening cause some independent intervening cause now case dont anything like independent employer in case number people agents employer so traditional principles  intervening cause one cant say one agents employer intervening cause broke chain causation misconduct agent employer you series agents employer engaging course conduct beginning unlawfully  unlawful discriminatory motive leads termination thats quite different employee deciding start fire engage sort misconduct nothing military status it i think  one would hope foreseeable result discipline given employee would start fire one would normally think even less extreme starting fire course misconduct employee foreseeable result discriminatory yes yes,222.0,264,11,do regard  butfor cause motivating factor are using proximate cause butfor suggesting different formulation causation in formulation youve articulated place test subordinate setting motion playing substantial role what test proposed brief  fit your  petitioners counsel argues issue  motivating factor test doesnt substantial role motivating factor subordinates what happens situation prior evaluation disciplinary action substantial effect decision thats  employment decision thats made employer notice prior evaluation disciplinary action based biased ground reasonable way finding based biased ground what happens situation how get around statutory language says motivating motivating factor  action challenged and employers action  discharge yes people  everybody delegated authority  employer  involved action thats challenged take action challenge so maybe test whether delegated responsibility challenged action delegated responsibility making discharge decision what situation particular procedure one set discriminatory reason employee really upset know starts fire plant wouldnt  wouldnt set fire discriminatory purpose now cause action case fired setting  setting office fire yes so accept traditional doctrine intervening cause applicable well  independent intervening cause well im sorry  i think end kind glided whole issue you say nothing military status it procedure set employer discriminating military status so certainly something military status well i know hypothetical extreme try flesh position you certainly imagine employee reacting particular way put procedures set discriminatory manner would seem anybody basis termination even though groundwork laid discriminatory procedure wouldnt  wouldnt employers defense simply anyone starts fire goes thats  thats  would happened matter reason that comes employers defense showing action would taken thank counsel mr davis,0.0,0,0,,0.0,0,0,,-5,2,114.0,-579.0
